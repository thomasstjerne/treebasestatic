The taxon has 540 ostioles per pseudostroma and small,\nellipsoidal to subfusiform ascospores with polar appendages.\nPhylogenetic analyses of a combined ITSLSUrpb2tef1 sequence matrix\nconfirmed its placement in Dendrostoma where it is close to D.\nqinlingense, D. osmanthi and D. quercus (species described from Quercus\nsp. in China), but representing a distinct linage. The new taxon is\ncompared with other Dendrostoma species and comprehensive descriptions\nand illustrations are provided. An ascospore comparison for relevant\nspecies is also provided, as well as an updated phylogenetic tree\n(ITSLSUrpb2tef1) including all the species of Dendrostoma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127687","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127687.phy"}]}
