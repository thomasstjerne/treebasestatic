Russularia) and with L.\nacatlanensis (L. subg. Lactarius). We confirmed their EcM association\nthrough comparison of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear\nribosomal DNA sequences from the mycobiont in the ectomycorrhizal\nsystems and basidiomes sampled in the forest stands. The phytobiont in\nthe ectomycorrhizae was also identified through the comparison of ITS\nsequences from EcM root tips and leaves of F. grandifolia var. mexicana.\nDetailed descriptions on the morphology and anatomy of EcM systems and\nmicroscopical features of mantle layers and Hartig net are presented and\nillustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131197.phy"}]}
