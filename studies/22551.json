Two similar\nPenicillium isolates could not be identified as previously described\nspecies in a survey of orchard apples from Tunisia for patulin producing\nfungi. These isolates are described as novel species using multilocus\nDNA sequence analysis of partial β-tubulin, calmodulin and nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions; and morphological,\nphysiological and biochemical characters. The isolates were considered\nnegative for patulin production since the isoepoxydon dehydrogenase\n(IDH) gene did not amplified and the compound detected at the same\nretention time of patulin (14.9 min) showed a different UV spectrum\nusing U-HPLC/UV-DAD. In terms of phylogeny, the two isolates clustered\nwith Penicillium section Ramosa and are closely related to P.\nchroogomphum, P. lenticrescens and P. soppii. Furthermore, their macro-\nand micro-morphological traits differed from these species. Hence, the\nisolates represent a novel species in Penicillium section Ramosa and the\nname Penicillium tunisiense sp. nov. is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Penicillium section Ramosa tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of ITS\nPenicillium section Ramosa sequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110860.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Penicillium tree","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of BenA\nsequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110847.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Penicillium section Ramosa tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of BenA\nPenicillium section Ramosa sequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110859.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAL Penicillium section Ramosa tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of CAL\nPenicillium section Ramosa sequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110861.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA&ITS&CAL Penicillium section Ramosa\ntree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of\nBenA&ITS&CAL Penicillium section Ramosa sequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110862.phy"}]}
