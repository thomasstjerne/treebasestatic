In this paper, eight fresh collections of\ntaxa of Dictyosporiaceae from submerged wood in freshwater are\ncharacterized based on morphological characters and phylogenetic\nanalyses of combined ITS, LSU and TEF1α sequence data. A new monotypic\ngenus Aquadictyospora, with A. lignicola as the type species is\nintroduced based on its distinct morphology and evidences from molecular\nphylogeny. In addition, detailed description and illustration of\nPseudodictyosporium wauense from the fresh collection are provided and\nit is a new record for China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110844","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110844.phy"}]}
