Relationships involving the deepest nodes have\nbeen difficult to resolve, limiting the potential for further cladistic\nstudies within the Ericoideae. The current study analyses six molecular\nmarkers using Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods\nto improve phylogenetic resolution within the Ericoideae. Two large\nclades were discovered. One clade includes the Phyllodoceae and Bejaria.\nThe sister clade includes the Empetreae + Diplarche, Ericeae, Rhodoreae,\nand a clade comprised of Bryanthus and Ledothamnus. The current study\nimproves upon the resolution of the phylogeny of the Ericoideae,\nparticularly demonstrating support for the deepest nodes. Based on these\nresults, we propose to retain the Ericeae, expand the Phyllodoceae to\ninclude Bejaria, expand the Empetreae to include Diplarche, retain the\nRhodoreae (without Diplarche), dismantle the Bejarieae, and construct a\nnew tribe, Bryantheae (Bryanthus and Ledothamnus).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericoideae: combined molecular data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_25445.phy"}]}
