Our results also show that bryozoans\nare more closely related to Neotrochozoa including molluscs and annelids\nthan to Syndermata, the latter comprising Rotifera and Acanthocephala.\nFurthermore, we find evidence for the position of Sipuncula within\nAnnelida. These findings suggest that classical developmental and\nmorphological key characters such as cleavage pattern, coelomic\ncavities, gut architecture and body segmentation are subject to greater\nevolutionary plasticity than traditionally assumed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1B","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa, BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4959.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1A","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4958.phy"}]}
