In addition, the family displays different\nleaf anatomical configurations. Here we addressed the evolutionary\nhistory of leaf anatomy and photosynthetic pathways in\nPortulacaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61146.phy"}]}
