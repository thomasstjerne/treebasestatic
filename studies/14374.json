The new species Aysenia paposo, from the coastal desert in\nnorthern Chile is sister to Aysenia araucana Ramírez. The diagnosis of\nAysenia araucana is updated and new somatic variability is reported for\nthe species. We present new records for other species of Aysenia and\nAysenoides. The new species Aysenoides simoi, from temperate forests in\nChile and adjacent Argentina is sister to Aysenoides nahuel. The\nphylogenetic analysis confirmed the monophyly of both genera. The\nsupport values of the genera are relatively high, but some internal\nbranches show low support values. The genus Aysenia is supported by\nthree synapomorphies, two of these from leg spination and one from the\nmale genitalia. Aysenoides is supported by three synapomorphies from\nmale and female genitalia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aysenia and Aysenoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68980.phy"}]}
