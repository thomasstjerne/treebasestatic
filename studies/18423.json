In this\nregard micrometazoans are an important component of marine environments\nand play crucial roles within pelagic and benthic habitats. To better\nunderstand the biodiversity of marine metazoans, we applied a\nhigh-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing approach to assess eukaryotic\nribosomal diversity across different European coastal locations, size\nfractions and depths. Metazoan 18S rDNA reads represent a large\npercentage of the total eukaryotic reads, being copepods and tunicates\nthe most abundant in the water column, while polychaetes, crustaceans,\nand platyhelminths are prominent groups in sediments. Crustaceans and\nnematodes are the richest taxa. Interestingly, our dataset contain a\nhigh percentage of novel 18S rDNA metazoan sequences, including a\npotentially novel environmental group likely close to tunicates. Our\ndata further suggest that metazoan gametes might play a significant\necological role as a source of organic carbon in the pico and nano\nsize-fractions of the plankton. Overall, our study provides an important\nresource in which to analyze not only abundance and richness patterns of\nmetazoans in marine coastal habitats, but also the existence of\npotential novel metazoan lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91669.phy"}]}
