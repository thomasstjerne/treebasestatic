Lichenized species are thought to make up a comparatively small\nportion of this figure, with unrecognized species richness hidden among\nlittle-studied, tropical microlichens. Recent findings, however, suggest\nthat some macrolichens contain a large number of unrecognized taxa,\nincreasing known species richness by an order of magnitude or more. Here\nwe report the existence of at least 126 species in what until recently\nwas believed to be a single taxon: the basidiolichen fungus Dictyonema\nglabratum, also known as Cora pavonia. Notably, these species are not\ncryptic but morphologically distinct. A predictive model suggests an\neven larger number, with over 400 species. These results call into\nquestion species concepts in presumably well-known macrolichens and\ndemonstrate the need for accurately documenting such species richness,\ngiven the importance of these lichens in endangered ecosystems such as\nparamos and the alarming potential for species losses throughout the\ntropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cora Corella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74969.phy"}]}
