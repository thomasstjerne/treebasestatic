Complex characters are\ngroups of features that can be divided into simpler hierarchical\ncharacters (reductive coding), although the implied hierarchical\nrelational information may change depending on the type of coding\n(composite vs reductive). Up to now, there is no common agreement to\neither code characters as complex or simple. Phylogeneticists have\ndiscussed which coding method is best, but have not incorporated the\nheuristic process of reciprocal illumination to evaluate the coding.\nComposite coding allows to test 1) if several characters were linked\nresulting in a structure described as a complex character or trait, or\n2) if independently evolving characters resulted in the configuration\nincorrectly interpreted as a complex character. We propose that complex\ncharacters or character states should be decomposed iteratively into\nsimpler characters when the original homology hypothesis is not\ncorroborated by a phylogenetic analysis, and the character or character\nstate is retrieved as homoplastic. We tested this approach using the\ncase of fruit types within subfamily Cinchonoideae (Rubiaceae). The\niterative reductive coding of characters associated to drupes allowed us\nto unthread fruit evolution within Cinchonoideae. Our results show that\ndrupes and berries are not homologous. As a consequence, a more precise\nontology for the Cinchonoideae drupes is required.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104171.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104172","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104172.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104173","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104173.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104174","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104174.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104175","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104175.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104176","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104176.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104177.phy"}]}
