In the green algal order Sphaeropleales\n(Chlorophyta), only one representative mitochondrial genome is 15\ncurrently availablethat of Acutodesmus obliquus. Our study adds nine\ncompletely sequenced and three partially sequencedmitochondrialgenomes\nspanningthephylogeneticdiversity ofSphaeropleales.We shownot only a size\nrange of2553 kband variation AQ6 inintroncontent (011) andgeneorderbut\nalsoconservationof13core respiratorygenes\nandfragmentedribosomalRNAgenes.We AQ7 also report an unusual case of\ngene arrangement convergence inNeochloris aquatica,where the two rns\nfragmentswere secondarily AQ8 placed in close proximity. Finally, we\nreport the unprecedented usage of UCG as stop codon in Pseudomuriella\nschumacherensis. In 20 addition, phylogenetic analyses of the\nmitochondrial protein-codinggenes yieldafully\nresolved,well-supportedphylogeny, showing promise for addressing\nsystematic challenges in green algae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales Phycas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77023.phy"},{"tree_label":"1 401 of 801","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales Phycas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77024.phy"},{"tree_label":"4 12 of 801","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales Phycas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77027.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 28 of 801","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales Phycas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77026.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 325 of 801","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales Phycas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77025.phy"}]}
