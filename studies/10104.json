The\nmonophyly of H. warnockii, H. grandiflora, H. brevicaulis, and H.\nnitida, plus the H. spicata species complex, are strongly supported. The\nremaining species are not monophyletic, prompting the recircumscription\nof H. spicata s.l. as H. spicata s.s. and H. arizonica, H. revoluta s.l.\nas H. revoluta s.s. and H. colemanii, and H. fallax as a synonym of H.\nparviflora. Four major morphologically distinct lineages exist within\nthe genus: H. warnockii, H. grandiflora, H. brevicaulis, H. spicata\nspecies complex. Within the latter, only H. spicata s.s. and H. nitida\nare strongly supported as sister species among all trees and the\npositions of H. revoluta s.s. and H. parviflora remain unresolved due to\nincongruence in the plastid trees when psbA is included or excluded from\nanalyses. Incongruence between the plastid and ITS topologies was\nrestricted to the positions of H. colemanii and H. arizonica, which\nsuggests that either one or both of these species are of hybrid origin\nor that the ITS topology has been influenced by incomplete lineage\nsorting.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myco-heterotrophic Hexalectris, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6139.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myco-heterotrophic Hexalectris, including psbA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myco-heterotrophic Hexalectris, excluding psbA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6405.phy"}]}
