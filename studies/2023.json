This research applies\ninformation from nucleotide sequences for eight plastid and nuclear loci\nto delineate a group of Northern Hemisphere peat moss species, the\nso-called Sphagnum subsecundum complex, which includes species known to\nbe gametophytically haploid or diploid (i.e. sporophytically\ndiploid-tetraploid). Despite the fact that S. subsecundum and several\nspecies in the complex have been attributed disjunct ranges that include\nall major continents, phylogenetic analyses suggest that the group is\nactually restricted to Europe and eastern North America. Plants from\nwestern North America, from California to Alaska, which are\nmorphologically similar to species of the S. subsecundum complex in\neastern N. America and Europe, actually belong to a different deep clade\nwithin Sphagnum section Subsecunda. One species often considered part of\nthe S. subsecundum complex, S. contortum, likely has a reticulate\nhistory involving species in the two deepest clades within section\nSubsecunda. Nucleotide sequences show strong geographic structure across\nthe section Subsecunda, but shallow tip clades suggest repeated long\ndistance dispersal in the the section as well.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. ML","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphagnum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5124.phy"}]}
