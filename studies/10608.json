Eight species new to science are described\nand two new combinations are proposed, raising the total number of\nspecies accepted in Cryptosporella to 19. The species delimitation and\nphylogeny for Cryptosporella is determined based on analyses of DNA\nsequences from three genes (β-tubulin, ITS, and tef1-α), comparative\nmorphology of sexual structures on their host substrate, and host\nassociations. The inferred phylogeny suggests that Cryptosporella has\nspeciated primarily on Betulaceae with 16 species occurring exclusively\non that plant family. The host range of most species seems to be narrow\nwith nine species reported only from a single host species or subspecies\nand seven species occurring on congeneric host species. The known\ndistribution range of Cryptosporella is expanded to mountain cloud\nforests of the provinces of Chiriquí in Panama and Tucumán in\nArgentina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptosporella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31294.phy"}]}
