Special\nemphasis was given to H. mulahacenii, described at the end of the 19th\ncentury from the Sierra Nevada Mountains in South Spain as a species of\nOreoweisia. The comparison with central European, Asian and Alaskan\nmaterial of Dicranoweisia intermedia proved the identity of both taxa,\nwhich was corroborated by molecular data. European taxa of Hymenoloma\nwere also compared to Chilean material identified as H. antarcticum and\nH. crispulum and it was found and confirmed by the molecular data that\nincluded two species referable to H. antarcticum and H. brevipes,\nrespectively, with all Hymenoloma accessions forming a monophyletic\ntaxon. A key to the genera Dicranoweisia and Hymenoloma and the 3\nEuropean species of Hymenoloma is included. Phylogenetic analysis of\nbasal haplolepidous taxa taking into account different genera mainly of\nthe Dicranales but also of Bryoxiphiales and Scouleriales suggest close\nrelationship of Hymenoloma with the Scouleriaceae, while Dicranoweisia\nis resolved within Rhabdoweisiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52839.phy"}]}
