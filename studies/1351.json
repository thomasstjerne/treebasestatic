Genealogical\nhistories of many species have revealed congruent patterns, which\nsuggest that the peninsula was temporarily submerged at two locations.\nWe sequenced a total of 1953 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial genome\nfor 42 specimens of the zebra tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides).\nThe resulting maternal genealogy supports the former existence of a mid\npeninsular seaway and a Plio Quaternary seaway across the Isthmus of La\nPaz. In addition, a genealogical break is revealed in the vicinity of\nLoreto. This genealogical break may have resulted from prolonged\nsubmergence of the Loreto Basin during Pliocene. The mid peninsular\nseaway may have occurred as early as late Miocene, at a time\nsignificantly earlier than previously hypothesized. Comparison with\nother genealogies and geological evidence suggests that current models\non the evolution of Baja California\u001as fauna are temporally shallow. The\ndeep genealogical patterns of C. draconoides also disagree with the very\nlimited population differentiation previously reported for allozyme\nmarkers, suggesting that maternal history may not be an appropriate\napproximation for population differentiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callisaurus draconoides consensus genealogy","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_483.phy"}]}
