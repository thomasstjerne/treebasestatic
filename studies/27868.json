It therefore joins a number of\nother bryophytes and ferns that represent tropical species disjunct to\nthe moderated microenvironments provided by the deep gorges of these\nhigh-rainfall mountains. Our evidence from starch gel electrophoresis of\nisozymes and sequencing of both chloroplast (rps4 and rpL16) and nuclear\n(ITS2) DNA supports this taxonomic decision originally proposed by Timo\nKoponen but largely ignored in recent checklists and floras. A similar\nsituation prevails in Hawaii, where plants previously referred to P.\nrostratum also proved to be P. rhynchophorum. Both of these species are\nallopolyploids, expressing fixed heterozygosity at diagnostic loci.\nAlthough more extensive sampling of populations and additional genetic\nmarkers are desirable, it is clear that P. rhynchophorum combines the\ngenomes of P. maximoviczii and P. integrum, whereas P. rostratum\ncombines the genomes of P. vesicatum and P. integrum. This conclusion is\ncongruent with morphological evidence, which shows the allopolyploids\nare intermediate or combine diagnostic characters of the progenitor\nhaploids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayes","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132808.phy"}]}
