Therefore, MLF are traditionally regarded as an\nold, ï¿½Tertiary relictï¿½ vegetation type. Here we address the question\nif key taxa of the MLF are relictual. We evaluated the relict hypothesis\nconsulting fossil data and analyses based on molecular phylogenies of 18\nrepresentative species. For molecular dating we used the program BEAST,\nfor ancestral trait reconstructions BayesTraits and Lagrange to infer\nancestral areas. Our molecular dating showed that the origins of four\nspecies date back to the Upper Miocene while 14 originated in the\nPlio-Pleistocene. This coincides with the decline of fossil\nlaurophyllous elements in Europe since the middle Miocene. Ancestral\ntrait and area reconstructions indicate that MLF evolved partly from\npre-adapted taxa from the Mediterranean, Macaronesia and the tropics.\nAccording to the fossil record laurophyllous taxa existed in Macaronesia\nsince the Plio- and Pleistocene. MLF are composed of species with a\nheterogeneous origin. The taxa dated to the Pleistocene are likely not\nï¿½Tertiary relictsï¿½. Some species may be interpreted as relictual. In\nthis case, the establishment of most species in the Plio-Pleistocene\nsuggests that there was a massive species turnover before this time.\nAlternatively, MLF were largely newly assembled through global\nrecruitment rather than surviving as relicts of a once more widespread\nvegetation. This process may have possibly been triggered by the\nintensification of the trade winds at the end of the Pliocene as\nindicated by proxy data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Viburnum-Sambucus","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78058","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78058.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ixanthus tree","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78570","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78570.phy"},{"tree_label":"Euphorbia tree","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphibiaceae BEAST tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_70706.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lauraceae BEAST","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70849","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_70849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aeonium & Aichryson matK","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78415","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78415.phy"},{"tree_label":"Picconia consensus","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78098","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78098.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aeonium & Aichryson tree ITS","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78423","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bystropogon tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78416","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78416.phy"},{"tree_label":"Isoplexis BEAST consensus","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77169","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Arbutus cons","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77181","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77181.phy"},{"tree_label":"Prumulaceae","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77190","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77190.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rhamnus BEAST consensus","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77191","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77191.phy"},{"tree_label":"Prunus","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77326","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77326.phy"}]}
