Talaromyces systylus sp. nov.,\nphylogenetically distinct from other species in the genus, was\ncharacterized morphologically by biverticillate adpressed conidiophora,\npenicilli showing metulae in symmetrical adpressed verticils, phialides\nampulliform-acerose, globose rough-walled conidia and conidial chains\nassociated in columns. On Malt Extract Agar penicilli were supported by\nindeterminate subulate synnemata. Optimal growing temperature was 30 C.\nTalaromyces systylus was compared with other related species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Talaromyces systylus ITS tree","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces systylus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88272.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BenA CaM","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces systylus ITS BenA CaM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89087.phy"},{"tree_label":"Talaromyces systylus BenA tree","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces systyus BenA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88271.phy"},{"tree_label":"Talaromyces systylus CaM tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces systylus CaM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88273.phy"}]}
