Despite the extensive history of work in the Boletaceae\nin North America, novel species and genera are continually being\ndescribed. Multigene molecular phylogenetic analyses of five loci were\ncombined with thorough morphological studies of several boletes from the\nsoutheastern USA. Based on our results, we describe four new species\nfound in the southeastern USA, Aureoboletus pseudoauriporus,\nCyanoboletus bessettii, Hemileccinum floridanum, and Xerocomellus\nbolinii. We also propose three combinations to reflect the results of\nour molecular analyses; Cyanoboletus cyaneitinctus comb. nov., a bolete\nthat is widespread across the eastern USA, C. cyaneitinctus\nf. reticulatus, and Lanmaoa sublurida, a rarely-documented bolete that\nis so far known only from Florida.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"305","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129682","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129682.phy"}]}
