In order to find out if these areas are also\nthe centers of origin, ancestral areas were reconstructed based on a\ndated molecular phylogeny. Sequences for three mitochondrial and one\nnuclear gene were combined for a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction.\nThe phylogeny confirmed most of the results of previous studies, but\nalso indicated that the Remizidae are not monophyletic, particularly\nCephalopyrus flammiceps is sister to the Paridae. Four approaches,\nparsimony- and likelihood-based ones, were applied to reconstruct\nancestral areas for ancestors of the 75% of the extant species for which\nsequence data were available. The common ancestor of the Paridae and the\nRemizidae inhabited tropical Africa and China. The Paridae as well as\nmost of its (sub)genera originated in China, but Baeolophus in the\nNearctic and Cyanistes in the Western Palearctic. Almost all\nbiogeographic reconstruction methods had come to similar results, but\nthose should be preferred which consider the likelihood of the\ntransition from one area to another.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49776","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49776.phy"}]}
