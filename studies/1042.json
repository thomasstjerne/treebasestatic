We have used sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer\nregion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat (ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2) and\nmorphology to infer relationships within Krameria. Using Kallstroemia\nparviflora, Guaiacum angustifolium, and Tribulus terrestris, three North\nAmerican members of the Zygophyllaceae as outgroups, our data provide\nevidence for two major clades in the genus, each containing a North and\na South American subclade. Both the major clades and subclades are\nsupported by morphological synapomorphies. The phylogeny does not\nprovide an unequivocal resolution as to the hemisphere in which Krameria\narose, but it does indicate an initial split leading to the ancestors of\nthe two clades, each of which subsequently produced radiations in North\nand South America. Therefore, there must have been two independent\ndispersals to, or two vicariant episodes involving, North and South\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Krameria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5800.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Krameria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5801.phy"}]}
