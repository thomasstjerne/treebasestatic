This is the second record of\nteleomorph of E. takamatsui. Morphological and molecular analyses\nrevealed that the asexual stage of the lotus powdery mildews found in\nNagoya, Osaka and Tokyo are anamorph of E. takamatsui. The nucleotide\nsequences of ITS and 28S rRNA gene was identical to those of E.\naquilegiae, E. catalpae, and E. macleayae. These species formed a\nhomogeneous clade with E. sedi, Pseudoidium neolycopersici, and\nPseudoidium spp. occurring on a wide range of plant families with only\nfive base substitutions of ITS sequences in maximum. These results\nsuggest that E. takamatsui is a fungus that appeared as a result of\nrecent host expansion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe Nelumbo 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe Lotus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71674.phy"}]}
