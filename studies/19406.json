Two species of Helicogloea\n(Atractiellomycetes) were analyzed for these characters and provide data\non SPB and nuclear division for an additional class of Puccinomycotina.\nA detailed analysis of septal pore apparatus for the Helicogloea species\npermits comparisons with those of other Pucciniomycotina and Ascomycota.\nThe endogenous origin of hyphal branches is shown to occur in a third\nclass of Puccinomycotina. The full set of characters supports a close\nrelationship between Atractiellomycetes and Pucciniomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96801","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96801.phy"}]}
