Multigene phylogenetic analyses\ndemonstrated four novel taxa belonging to the families\nAnastomitrabeculiaceae, Parabambusicolaceae, Pyrenochaetopsidaceae and\nTetraploasphaeriaceae. Hence, Paramultiseptospora bambusae gen. et sp.\nnov., Pyrenochaetopsis yunnanensis sp. nov. and Tetraploa bambusae sp.\nnov. are introduced. In addition, Anastomitrabeculia didymospora was\nfound on bamboo twigs in terrestrial habitats for the first time and is\nreported in this study. Detailed morphological descriptions and updated\nphylogenetic trees of each family are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136170.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136171.phy"}]}
