In macro- and micro-morphology, this species is\nsimilar to P. kuehneri but differs in basidiospore morphology; shape is\nmore rhomboid or mitriform and also rostrated at base (around apiculus).\nThis distinct basidiospore shape differs this species from all other\nParasola species. The results of phylogenetic analysis with the ITS data\nalso support this new taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Phylogenetic tree for Parasola neoplicatilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91948.phy"}]}
