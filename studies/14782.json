The species is known from only a small number\nof collections from eastern Brazil, in the Atlantic Rainforest of Bahia\nand Minas Gerais states. It is considered endangered given the rapid\ndeforestation of this biome. The species is readily distinguished from\nits congeners by its large, tardily dehiscent fruit that does not open\nby reflexed valves and by the seeds enveloped by thick arils. Given its\nremarkable fruits and the consequent initial doubt about the generic\nposition of the new species in Celastraceae, a phylogenetic analysis\nusing molecular data from plastid and nuclear rDNA gene regions,\ntogether with morphological characters, was performed. The new species\nwas consistently resolved as nested within Maytenus, which itself is\nparaphyletic. Incongruence between the nuclear and plastid gene regions\nwas identified for Fraunhofera, Maytenus texana, and Plenckia. Future\ntaxonomic changes are necessary to rigorously delimit Maytenus as a\nnatural genus. Additional comments on geographical distribution,\nphenology and conservation status of the new species are also provided,\nas well as a key to the species of Neotropical Maytenus with spinose\nleaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maytenus Combined Result","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68896.phy"}]}
