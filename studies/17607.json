(Basidiomycota) is\ndescribed. Hyphodontia borbonica was found on the tropical island La\nRÃ©union of the Mascarene archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It is\ncharacterized by a poroid hymenophore, a pseudodimitic hyphal system and\nlagenocystidia, which is a new combination in this genus. The\nphylogenetic analyses with ITS sequences show a relationship to\nHyphodontia arguta, H. pallidula and H. alutaria. A description, line\ndrawings, phylograms, an emendation of the genus and a new key are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"50% majority rule consensus phylogram received from a\nBayesian analysis of ITS sequences.
