All these snails live, often in large numbers, on or near\nlimestone rocks, where they feed on microflora. This ecological\nsimilarity may explain why their diversity is mainly allopatric (sensu\nSolem, 1984): morphologically characterised species are confined to\nrelatively small geographic areas which do not or hardly overlap.\nGinenberger (1991) considered this pattern of diversity to have resulted\nfrom non-adaptive radiation, the term non-adaptive referring not to any\nsupposed neutral type of evolution, but used in contrast to adaptive\nradiation, where speciation is accompanied by conspicuous\nniche-segregation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 26.3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cretan Albinaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3333.phy"}]}
