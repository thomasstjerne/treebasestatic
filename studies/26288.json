The H. vastatrix secretome was subjected to functional\ncategorization and the greatest similarities were observed between\nspecies of the genus Puccinia sp (398), and Melampsora larici-populina\n(82). Based on the secretome, 415 Gene Ontology terms were extracted.\nThe putative secretome was also compared to the high-throughput\ntranscriptome of coffee-H. vastatrix interactions. By the transcriptome\ncomparison data and the results of functional annotation and\ncharacteristics associated with effector proteins, 15 genes were\nselected and analyzed using RT-qPCR during compatible and incompatible\ncoffee-H. vastatrix interactions. The expression patterns suggested that\nthe EHv33-18 and EHv33-25 candidate effector may be responsible for\nfaster communication between pathogen and the host during incompatible\ninteraction. Other six candidate are involved in the biotrophic stage of\ninfection, which is characterized by an increase in the expression of\neffectors, and in enzymes involved in secondary metabolism. Phylogenetic\nanalysis suggest that these eight genes follow evolutionary mechanisms\nexclusive to the coffee-H. vastatrix interaction, making them important\ntargets in studies aimed at obtaining durable resistance to this\ndisease. Interactomic network made between coffee proteins and H.\nvastatrix proteins was obtained for the first time and revealed a wide\nnetwork of interactions between effector EHv33-19 and coffee proteins.\nThe obtained results suggest that there may be communication between the\npathogen and the host in the early stage of infection during the\nurediniospores germination phase. This indicated pre-haustorial\nresistance complementary to post-haustorial resistance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-27 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-18 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124154.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-25 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungal ITS marker tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124156.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-30 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124155.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-24 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124160.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-32 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-19 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124159.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary Material 4","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EHv33-21 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124162.phy"}]}
