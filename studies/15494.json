Mesozoic\nsnakeflies were markedly more diverse than the modern ones are. However,\nthe evolutionary history of Raphidioptera is largely unexplored, as a\nresult of the poorly studied phylogeny among fossil and extant lineages\nwithin the order. Results In this paper, we report a new snakefly\nfamily, Juroraphidiidae fam. nov., based on exquisitely preserved\nfossils, attributed to a new species Juroraphidia longicollum gen. et\nsp. nov., from the Jiulongshan Formation (Middle Jurassic) in Inner\nMongolia, China. The new family is characterized by an unexpected\ncombination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters of Raphidioptera.\nBased on our phylogenetic analysis, Juroraphidiidae fam. nov. together\nwith Raphidiomorpha form a monophyletic clade, which is the sister to\nPriscaenigmatomorpha. The snakefly affinity of Priscaenigmatomorpha is\nconfirmed and another new family, Chrysoraphidiidae fam. nov., is\nerected in this suborder. Conclusions Juroraphidiidae fam. nov. is\ndetermined to be a transitional lineage between Priscaenigmatomorpha and\nRaphidiomorpha. Diversification of higher snakefly taxa had occurred by\nthe Early Jurassic, suggesting that these insects had already had a long\nbut undocumented history by this time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fossil snakeflies from China, MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72480.phy"}]}
