The cultures of the Cadophora species were isolated from\nthe roots of long-beak sedge and white spruce from a subalpine forest in\nWestern Canada; however, they likely have a wide distribution because\ntheir internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences have high similarity\nwith a number of GenBank sequences from various ecological studies. The\ntaxonomy of Cadophora in Leotiomycetes is discussed based on the\nphylogeny generated in this study. Results from this work will\nfacilitate ecological and evolutionary studies on root-associated\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cadophora 5 genes","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora 5 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107398.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora RPB1 T","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107296.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora EF1 T","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107295.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cadophora LSU","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora LSU T","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cadophora ITS","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora ITS Environmental T","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107294.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cadophora BTCad T","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107299.phy"}]}
