Based on morphology, phylogenetic relationships and host\ndistributions, the taxonomic implication for the genus and other related\ntaxa are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107824.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107825.phy"}]}
