Another on\nM. arnottiana was morphologically distinct from all other Meliosma rust\nfungi and, therefore, a new species, N. sriphumensis, is proposed. A\nuredinial-telial fungus found on Ampelocissus araneosa (Vitaceae) was\nmorphologically similar to, but distinct from, Phakopsora\ncronartiiformis on Parthencissus semicordata in producing characteristic\nurediniospores. It was sister to a N. uva clade in a molecular\nphylogram; and, therefore, a new species, N. doipuiensis, is proposed.\nRepeated molecular phylogenetic analyses confirmed that GLR fungal\ngroups distributed in Southeast Asia and Australasia were distinct from\nNeophysopella fungi on Vitis species in temperate East Asia and the\nAmericas. Therefore, the Southeast Asian-Australasian GLR fungus was\nrecognized as a new species and named as N. tropicalis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"GLR TVB","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123158.phy"}]}
