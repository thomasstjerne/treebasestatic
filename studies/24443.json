These proteins are\npurposely built for replication in the organelle environment and are\ndistinct from those involved in replication of the nuclear genome. These\norganelle-localized proteins also have ancestral roots in bacterial and\nbacteriophage genes, supporting the endosymbiotic theory of their\norigin. We examined the interactions between three of these proteins\nfrom Arabidopsis thaliana: a DNA helicase-primase similar to\nbacteriophage T7 gp4 protein and animal mitochondrial Twinkle, and two\nDNA polymerases, Pol1A and Pol1B. We used a three- pronged approach to\nanalyze the interactions, including Yeast-two-hybrid analysis, Direct\nCoupling Analysis (DCA), and thermophoresis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plant Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117993.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plant Polymerase","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117994.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plant Twinkle","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117995.phy"}]}
