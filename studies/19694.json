Here, we sequenced eleven\nmitochondrial genomes of the polyneopteran insects by using high\nthroughput pooled sequencing technology, and presented a phylogenetic\nreconstruction for this group based on expanded mitochondrial genome\ndata. Our analyses included 189 taxa, of which 139 species represent all\nthe major polyneopteran lineages. Multiple results support the monophyly\nof Polyneoptera, the monophyly of Dictyoptera, and the monophyly of\nOrthoptera. Sister taxon relationships Plecoptera + Dermaptera, and\nZoraptera + Embioptera are also supported by most analyses. Within\nDictyoptera, the Blattodea is consistently retrieved as paraphyly due to\nthe sister group relationship of Cryptocercus with Isoptera. In\naddition, the results demonstrate that model selection, data treatment,\nand outgroup choice can have significant effects on the reconstructed\nphylogenetic relationships of Polyneoptera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcg_aa_ml.tre","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103986","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103986.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcg_pb","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103988.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcgrna_pb","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103990","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103990.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcgdegen_pb","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyneoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103982.phy"},{"tree_label":"189taxa_pcgrna_ml","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyneoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103993.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcgrna_ml","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyneoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103989.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcg_ml","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyneoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103984.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcgdegenrna_ml","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103983","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103983.phy"},{"tree_label":"189taxa_pcgdegenrna_ml","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103991.phy"},{"tree_label":"189taxa_pcgdegenrna_pb","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103992","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103992.phy"},{"tree_label":"189taxa_pcgrna_pb","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103994","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103994.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcg_aa_pb.tre","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr103985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103985.phy"},{"tree_label":"154taxa_pcgdegen_ml","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyneoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103981.phy"}]}
