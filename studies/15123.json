Here, we examine the evolutionary\nrelationships among the six species of Oenothera section Kneiffia using\nsequences from two nuclear and four chloroplast genes. Through field\nstudies we describe the effective pollinators for four species that had\nnot been previously reported, and experimentally test for pollen\nlimitation. Three of the six species are SC, and three are SI. The\nphylogeny strongly supports three separate transitions from SI to SC.\nDespite the expectation that SC species evolved the ability to self\nbecause of pollen limitation, or that pollen limitation evolves among SC\nspecies, we found no significant differences in pollen limitation\nbetween the SI and SC species in this study. Our results resolve the\ninterspecific relationships within section Kneiffia, show that breeding\nsystems can be quite labile, and provide evidence that transitions to\nself-compatibility do not always coincide with pollen limitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69256","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69256.phy"}]}
