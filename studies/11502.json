Fusarium crassistipitatum can be distinguished from the\nother soybean SDS and Phaseolus/Vigna root rot pathogens (BRR)\nphenotypically by the production of yellowish colonies on PDA; and tall,\nstout and mostly unbranched conidiophores with a thick-walled base,\nwhich form mutiseptate conidia apically. Phylogenetic species\nrecognition based on genealogical concordance of a six-gene dataset\nstrongly supported the reciprocal monophyly of F. crassistipitatum with\nrespect to the other SDS and BRR pathogens. Isolates of F.\ncrassistipitatum were able to induce typical SDS foliar and root-rot\nsymptoms on soybean that were indistinguishable from those caused by\nthree other SDS pathogens (i.e., F. virguliforme, F. brasiliense and F.\ntucumaniae) on susceptible cultivars A 6445RG and N 4613RG in a\npathogenicity experiment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 24","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46029.phy"},{"tree_label":"83s","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46030.phy"},{"tree_label":"96s","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46031.phy"},{"tree_label":"44s","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46032.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46035.phy"},{"tree_label":"65s","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46033.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium crassistipitatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46034.phy"}]}
