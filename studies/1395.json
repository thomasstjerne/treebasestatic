Phylogenetic analyses of four\nrapidly evolving molecular DNA regions (ITS, ETS, trnL-F, and rpl16) and\na morphological data set under several optimality criteria reveal that\nthe M. moschatus alliance is composed of three geographically defined\nclades: the Sierra Nevada Clade (M. floribundus, M. norrisii and M.\ndudleyi), the Snake River Clade (M. hymenophyllus, M. ampliatus and M.\npatulus) and the Columbia River Clade (M. washingtonensis and M.\njungermannioides). The relationships within and among the clades are\nwell resolved. Numerous instances of morphological homoplasy among the\nclades are inferred. Although nearly half of the morphological\ncharacters are highly homoplasious, the inclusion of a morphological\ndata set in the combined parsimony and Bayesian analyses improves\nphylogenetic resolution and support. The phylogeny reveals three\nindependent origins of a habitat adapted to cliff environments and three\nseparate origins of the autogamous mating system. The phylogenetic\nresults indicate the specific recognition of three rare taxa (M.\nampliatus, M. patulus, and M. dudleyi), previously synonymized with more\nwidespread species. A key to the species within the M. moschatus\nalliance is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.3a","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ets.bo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_316.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.3d","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rpl.bo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_313.phy"},{"tree_label":"combomol.ML","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combomol.ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_311.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPL.ML","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPL.ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_312.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.3c","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trn.bo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_314.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.3b","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"its.bo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_315.phy"},{"tree_label":"morph.MB.con.all","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"morph.MB.con.all","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2219.phy"},{"tree_label":"combomol.ML.BO","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combomol.ML.BO","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2220.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB.best","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2214.phy"},{"tree_label":"morph.MB.con.ingroup","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"morph.MB.con.ingroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2218.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.5b","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB.combo.molmorpho.con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2215.phy"},{"tree_label":"combomolmorph.MP.BO.polys","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combomolmorph.MP.BO.polys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2217.phy"},{"tree_label":"ETS.MP.con","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ETS.MP.con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2211.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS.MP.con","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS.MP.con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2210.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB.best","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2212.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.5a","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB.combo.mol.con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2213.phy"},{"tree_label":"combomol.MP.BO","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combomol.MP.BO","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2207.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPL.MP.BO","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPL.MP.BO","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2208.phy"},{"tree_label":"TRN.MP.con","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TRN.MP.con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2209.phy"},{"tree_label":"combomolmorph.MP.BO.nopolys","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combomolmorph.MP.BO.nopolys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2216.phy"}]}
