Using a combination\nof micro-morphological characteristics and multigene (ITS, SSU, LSU,\nTEF) phylogenics, the isolates were proved to be two Simplicillium\nspecies which were previously undescribed. The two new species (S.\ncatenulatum and S. spumae) differ from known Simplicillium species in\nthe morphology of their conidia and conidiophores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr119642","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119642.phy"}]}
