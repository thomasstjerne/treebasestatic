Previous studies established that populations from\nthe eastern United States, Sweden, and China were conspecific based on\nmating compatibility and enzyme profiles. In this study, mating\ncompatibility was extended to include collections from Russia, Costa\nRica, Mexico, and Utah. The molecular diversity of A. pyxidatus was\nexamined by DNA sequence and restriction site analyses of the nuclear\nribosomal internally transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). A\nphylogenetic analysis of twelve isolates based on ITS sequences revealed\na broad geographical pattern in which Eurasian isolates comprise a\nsister clade to North American isolates. North American isolates appear\nto be further subdivided into northeastern and southwestern clades. A\nsurvey of 255 A. pyxidatus isolates using restriction enzymes revealed\nvariable RFLP patterns that follow similar geographical patterns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Artomyces pyxidatus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Artomyces pyxidatus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1169.phy"}]}
