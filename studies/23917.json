The validation of these\nnovel species is supported further by the analyses of the Î²-tubulin,\ncalmodulin, actin, and RPB2 sequences. In addition, the phylogenetic\ntree and DDBJ accession numbers of all the species of Aspergillus\nsection Fumigati are presented. We report on the crossing of A. takadae\nspecies and the result of crossing A. takadae with a closely related\nspecies, A. spathulatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119278","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119278.phy"}]}
