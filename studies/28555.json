Although the diseases of leaves and fruits have been\nextensively studied, the causal organisms of branch diseases remain\npoorly known in China. Species of Botryosphaeriaceae are known as\nimportant fungal pathogens causing branch diseases on citrus in the USA\nand Europe. To determine the diversity of Botryosphaeriaceae species\nassociated with citrus branch diseases in China, surveys were conducted\nin the major citrus-producing areas from 2017 to 2020. Diseased tissues\nwere collected from twigs, branches and trunks with a range of symptoms\nincluding cankers, cracking, dieback and gummosis. Based on\nmorphological characteristics and phylogenetic comparison of the DNA\nsequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1), the Î²-tubulin gene\n(tub2) and the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest subunit\n(rpb2), 111 isolates from nine provinces were identified as 18 species\nof Botryosphaeriaceae, including Botryosphaeria dothidea, B.\nfabicerciana, Diplodia seriata, Dothiorella alpina, Do. plurivora,\nLasiodiplodia citricola, L. iraniensis, L. pseudotheobromae, L.\ntheobromae, Neodeightonia subglobosa, Neofusicoccum parvum, and six\npreviously undescribed species, namely Do. citrimurcott, L. guilinsis,\nL. huangyanensis, L. linhaisis, L. ponkan and Sphaeropsis linhaina spp.\nnov. Botryosphaeria dothidea (28.8 %) was the most abundant species,\nfollowed by L. pseudotheobromae (23.4 %), which was the most widely\ndistributed species on citrus, occurring in six of the nine provinces\nsampled. Pathogenicity tests indicated that all 18 species of\nBotryosphaeriaceae obtained from diseased citrus tissues in this study\nwere pathogenic to the tested Citrus reticulata shoots in vitro, while\nnot all species are pathogenic to the tested C. grandis shoots in vivo.\nIn addition, Lasiodiplodia was the most aggressive genus both in vitro\nand in vivo. This is the first study to identify Botryosphaeriaceae\nspecies related to citrus branch diseases in China and the results\nprovide a theoretical basis for the implementation of prevention and\ncontrol measures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
