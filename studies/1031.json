The results support other recent studies in\nshowing that neither the Ingeae nor Acacieae is monophyletic. Some\nsubgenera of Acacia, specifically subgenera Acacia and Phyllodineae, are\nmonophyletic, but subg. Acacia is in a basal polychotomy with various\nmembers of Mimoseae and a large clade with the other members of Ingeae\nand Acacieae. Acacia subg. Phyllodineae is sister group to members of\nthe Ingeae. Both the Ingeae and Acacia subg. Aculeiferum are\nparaphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acacieae/Ingeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1239.phy"}]}
