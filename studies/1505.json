Characterizing rate discrepancies and evaluating the\nrelative roles of time and rate along branches through the past are both\ncritical to a full understanding of evolutionary history. In this study,\nwe explore the interactions of time and rate in filmy ferns\n(Hymenophyllaceae), a lineage with extreme branch length differences\nbetween the two major clades. We test for the presence of significant\nrate discrepancies within and between these clades, and we separate time\nand rate across the filmy fern phylogeny to simultaneously yield an\nevolutionary time scale of filmy fern diversification and\nreconstructions of ancestral rates of molecular evolution. Our results\nindicate that the branch length disparity observed between the major\nlineages of filmy ferns is indeed due to a significant difference in\nmolecular evolutionary rate. The estimation of divergence times reveals\nthat the timing of crown group diversification was not concurrent for\nthe two lineages, and the reconstruction of ancestral rates of molecular\nevolution points to a substantial rate deceleration in one of the\nclades. Further analysis suggests that this may be due to a genome-wide\ndeceleration in the rate of nucleotide substitution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filmy ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_947.phy"}]}
