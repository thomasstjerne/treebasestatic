Since the 1990s however\ndisease outbreaks have occurred increasingly on ornamental C. lawsoniana\nin Europe; and in 2007 the pathogen was discovered in soil around old\ngrowth Chamaecyparis obtusa in Taiwan, where it may be endemic. When the\nphenotypes of over 150 isolates of P. lateralis from Taiwan, across the\nPNW (British Columbia to California) and from France, the Netherlands\nand the UK were compared three growth rate groups were resolved: one\nslow growing from Taiwan, one fast growing from the PNW and Europe, and\none of intermediate growth from a small area of the UK. Within these\ngrowth groups distinct subtypes were identified based on colony patterns\nand spore metrics and further discriminated in a multivariate analysis.\nThe assumption that the three main growth groups represented\nphylogenetic units was tested by comparative sequencing of two\nmitochondrial and three nuclear genes. This assumption was confirmed. In\naddition two phenotype clusters within the Taiwan growth group were also\nshown to be phylogenetically distinct. These four phenotypically and\ngenotypically unique populations are informally designated as the PNW\nlineage, the UK lineage, the Taiwan J lineage, and the Taiwan K lineage.\nTheir characteristics and distribution are described and their\nevolution, taxonomic, and plant health significance is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MSCOXSQ1000NJ","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis COXI-COXII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54828.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis ITSGWEUK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54826.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis COXI-COXII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54889.phy"},{"tree_label":"MSCOXSQ1000NJ","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54827.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITSGWEUKMB2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis ITSGWEUK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54922.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis COXI-COXII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54921.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis COXI-COXII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54825.phy"},{"tree_label":"MSITSGWSQ1000N","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora lateralis ITSGWEUK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54890.phy"}]}
