A new hypogeous species, Balsamia lishanensis\nwas described and illustrated from the North China based on\nmorphological and molecular evidence. B. lishanensis is mainly\ncharacterized by reddish brown ascomata covered with fine warts, the\nwhitish gleba with numerous small chambers open to 1 mm, 35 layers\nperidium reddish brown polygonal cells and the smooth and regular\nellipsoid ascospores with one large oil drop. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses based on ITS and LSU supported the placement of the new\nspecies. And B. platyspora was confirmed existence in China based on\nnewly collected specimens. Two species previously described as Barssia\nwere transferred to Balsamia. A key to four known Chinese species has\nbeen provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122593.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122594.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122595.phy"}]}
