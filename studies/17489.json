We found that presence-absence\nvariation of four group I introns and two homing endonuclease genes\n(hegs) primarily determined the mitogenome length differences among the\nstrains analyzed. Three group I introns (cox2 intron 2, cob intron 1 and\ncox1 intron 13) and the heg encoded by cob intron 4 were irregularly\ndistributed among strains of F. graminearum s. s., whereas cox2 intron 3\nand heg located within cox1 intron 9 were unique to a single strain.\nNearly identical intron patterns were found between some F. graminearum\ns.s. strains and the F. culmorum strain, but proved more varied among\nthe other F. graminearum s.s. strains. Furthermore, we found that all\nirregularly distributed introns and hegs showed evidence of putative\nhorizontal transfer. The patterns of intron/hegs distribution did not\ncorrelate to the geographic origin of the strains. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on whole mitogenome sequence data showed partial correlation\nbetween tree topology and origin of the strains analyzed. The results of\nthe studies presented in this paper provide new insight into\nintraspecific mitogenome variation of F. graminearum s.s.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium graminearum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87984.phy"}]}
