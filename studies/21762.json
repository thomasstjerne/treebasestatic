The new species is\nmorphologically very similar to C. dulciolens but is distinguished from\nthat species by having vivid mauve-violet lamellae when young, reduced\nverrucose spore ornamentation, a less pronounced plage, and the presence\nof abundant clamp connections in the epicuticular hyphae. A molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and RNA\npolymerase second largest subunit (RPB2) found that C. atropileatus is\nsister to the sequestrate C. beeverorum, and the clade formed by these\ntwo species are sister to the agaricoid C. dulciolens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107717","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107717.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110508.phy"}]}
