The results showed that the fungal had\nantagonistic effects on all the four Fusarium sp. By observing the\nmorphological features and cultural characteristics, and combining with\nthe molecular biology methods of ITS-rDNA and β-tubulin sequence\nanalysis, we identified the fungal as Penicillium cyclopium D12. P.\ncyclopium D12 had inhibitory effects on the hyphae growth of\nFusarium oxysporum, F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum and F. solani to\ndifferent extents. The inhibitory rates on PDA medium were 69.8%, 73.3%,\n85.8 %, and 64.3%, respectively. We also performed pot experiment and\nthe results showed that the fermentation products of P. cyclopium could\nsignificantly increase the biomass of Malus hupehensis seedlings; the\nplant height, ground diameter, fresh weight and dry weight were\nincreased by 41.98%, 15.01%, 40.34% and 51.53 % compared to control. The\nfermentation products also showed good inhibitory effect on F. oxysporum\nin the soil. Therefore, P. cyclopium D12, as an antagonistic fungal,\nwould be a promising biocontrol candidate for prevention and control of\napple replant disease.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128305.phy"}]}
