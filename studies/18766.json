In the present\nstudy, we reported several characteristics of CR1 elements in a draft\ngenome of Arborophila rufipectus (Sichuan partridge). According to the\nanalyses of RepeatMasker, approximately 254,966 CR1 elements were\nidentified in A. rufipectus, covering 6.7% of the genome. Subsequently,\nwe selected eighteen novel CR1 elements by comparing the chicken genome,\nturkey genome and assembled A. rufipectus scaffolds. Here, a combined\ndataset comprising of twenty two CR1 loci, mitochondrial genomes and\neight unlinked introns was analyzed to infer the evolutionary\nrelationships of twelve Phasianidae species. The applicability of CR1\nsequences for inferring avian phylogeny relative to mtDNA and intron\nsequences was investigated as well. Our results elucidated the position\nof A. rufipectus in Phasianidae with robust supports that it presented a\nsister clade to A. ardens/A. brunneopectus, and implied that genus\nArborophila was in a basal phylogenetic position within Phasianidae and\na phylogenetic affinity between Meleagris gallopavo and Pucrasia\nmacrolopha. Therefore, this work not only resolved some of the\nconfounding relationships among Phasianidae, but also suggested CR1\nsequences could provide powerful complementary data for phylogeny\nreconstruction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93326","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93326.phy"}]}
