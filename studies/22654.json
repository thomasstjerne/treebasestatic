In this study, 81\ncollections of Flammulina from East Asia, Europe, and North America were\nstudied, and their phylogeny and species delimitation were inferred from\npartial sequences of the ITS, tef1-α, rpb2, and homeodomain1 (HD1) of\nthe mating gene (labeled as HD1-A). Genetic structure analyses based on\ngenomic SSR markers and haplotype network analysis based on HD1-A were\nalso used to delimit several closely related taxa. Twelve phylogenetic\nspecies were recognized, which was largely consistent with previous\nstudies. However, our integrated studies indicated that Enokitake is not\nidentical to the European winter mushroom F. velutipes, and thus should\nbe treated as a separate species, namely F. filiformis. All cultivated\nstrains of “F. velutipes” in East Asia, including those from South Korea\nand Japan with genome sequences labeled as such, are in fact F.\nfiliformis. A new species, F. finlandica, was also unexpectedly\ndiscovered in Northern Europe. Morphological descriptions of these two\nspecies, color photos of their fresh basidiomata, and line drawings of\ntheir microscopic features are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112030","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112030.phy"}]}
