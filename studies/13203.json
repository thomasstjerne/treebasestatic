Here we report on a new dromaeosaurid, Tianyuraptor\nostromi gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of\nwestern Liaoning, China, based on a nearly complete skeleton.\nTianyuraptor possesses several features only seen in other Liaoning\ndromaeosaurids, although to a less developed degree, and it also\nexhibits features unknown in Laurasian dromaeosaurids but present in the\nGondwanan dromaeosaurids and basal avialans, thus reducing the\nmorphological gap between these groups. Tianyuraptor possesses a\ncomparatively small furcula and proportionally short forelimbs. This\nlies in stark contrast to the possible capacity for flight in the\nmicroraptorines, which have proportionally long and robust forelimbs and\nlarge furculae. The presence of such striking differences between the\nEarly Cretaceous Jehol dromaeosaurids reveals a great diversity in\nmorphology, locomotion and ecology early in dromaeosaurid\nevolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55904.phy"}]}
