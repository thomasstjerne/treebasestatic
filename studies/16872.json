An undescribed\nspecies of Roestelia was found on leaves of Photinia niitakayamensis\nnear Mt. Hehuan in central Taiwan. Results Roestelia niitakayamensis sp.\nnov. is characterized by the presence of smooth outer wall, rugose side\nwall, and coralloid projection inner wall on the peridial cells, and the\nechinulate processes on aeciospores. Sequences of the SSU rDNA,\nITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2, and the LSU rDNA of R. niitakayamensis and G.\nasiaticum were obtained, with 96% identity between the two species.\nPhylogenetic relationships inferred by partial LSU sequences indicated\nthat R. niitakayamensis is close to G. confusum, G. asiaticum, and G.\nunicorne. Conclusion The unique morphological and molecular\ncharacteristics showed that R. niitakayamensis, an endemic rust fungus\nin Taiwan, is new to science.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"analysis of D1/D2 region of the LSU rDNA of Roestelia\nniitakayamensis and related Gymnosporangium species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80519.phy"}]}
