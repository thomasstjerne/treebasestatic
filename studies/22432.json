Maximum\nparsimony, Maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses of\ncombined ITS, LSU, SSU and tef1-Î± sequence data were performed to\nclarify the phylogenetic affinities of the species. Pseudolophiostoma\nmangiferae is distinguished from the type species, P. vitigenum based on\nsize of ascomata, asci, ascospores and phylogenetic inferences. In\naddition, Vaginatispora fuckelii is described as a new record from\nTaiwan. Both isolates are compared with other similar species and\ncomprehensive descriptions and micrographs are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudolophiostoma mangiferae sp. nov. &\nVaginatispora fuckelii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111940.phy"}]}
