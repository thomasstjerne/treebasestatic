The morphological traits of this\npowdery mildew strongly resemble those of Phyllactinia species\n(including Ovulariopsis) belonging to a phylogenetically basal group\nclosely related to Leveillula species, but phylogenetic examinations and\nanalyses clearly showed that this fungus pertains to Leveillula. Within\nthe latter genus, it seems to be allied to L. duriaei, but clearly\ndiffers from this species in having conidiophores arising from\nsuperficial hyphae and narrower conidia with different length/width\nratios. Therefore, the powdery mildew on B. asiatica is described as\nLeveillula buddlejae sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leveillula buddlejae 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110655.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leveillula buddlejae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110656.phy"}]}
