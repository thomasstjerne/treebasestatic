Three of them, C.\naavae, C. brunneocalcarius, and C. grosmorneÃ«nsis, belong to subgenus\nTelamonia and one, C. subfloccopus, to /Fulvescentes. The relationship\nof the fifth species, C. brunneotinctus, was not solved but it resembles\nspecies of /Anomali. Cortinarius brunneocalcarius and C. aavae do not\nhave close relatives within the subgenus Telamonia whereas C.\ngrosmorneÃ«nsis belongs to sect. Brunnei. Four of the species have wide\ndistribution, Cortinarius brunneocalcarius and C. subfloccopus occur in\nNorth America and Europe and C. brunneotinctus and C. aavae in Western\nand Eastern North America, but C. grosmorneÃ«nsis is only known from\nEastern Canada. The descriptions of the novel species are presented and\ncomparison to similar species provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51328.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51329","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51329.phy"}]}
