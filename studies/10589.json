This species is known\nas an antagonist of cultivation of the edible mushroom Coprinus comatus.\nStromata of X. coprinicola are cylindrical, terminate in a sterile apex\nand arise in fascicles from a relative large submerged base; perithecia\nare immersed and have conspicuously conical ostiolar openings;\nascospores are minute. Phylogenetic analyses based on combined partial\nsequences of rpb2, b-tub and a-act genes showed that X. coprinicola is\nclosely related to those Xylaria species exclusively associated with\ntermite nests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BA tree","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylaria and related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9872.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylaria and related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9882.phy"}]}
