Here we assign formal\ndescriptions and Latin binomials to some of the most clinically relevant\nphylogenetic species of the genus. Three new species, named\nNeocosmospora catenata, N. gamsii and N. suttoniana (previously assigned\nto the informal names ‘Fusarium’ solani species complex [FSSC] lineages,\nFSSC 43, FSSC 7 and FSSC 20, respectively) are described on the basis of\nmultilocus phylogenetic analyses (using EF-1α, ITS, LSU and RPB2 loci)\nand morphological characters. Lineage FSSC 9 is conspecific with the\nex-type strain of Cylindrocarpon tonkinense, thus the new combination\nNeocosmospora tonkinensis is proposed. In addition, and based on the\nlatest taxonomy for this generic complex, new combinations are\nintroduced for four medically important taxa: Neocosmospora lichenicola,\nN. keratoplastica, N. metavorans and N. petroliphila. The most\nsignificant distinctive features for all the clinically relevant species\ntreated here are compared and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107159","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107159.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107161.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107162.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107163.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107160","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107160.phy"}]}
