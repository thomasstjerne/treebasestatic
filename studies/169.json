(Diseae. Orchidoideae. Orchidaceae) are described\nand illustrated in detail. On the basis of these characters the presumed\nphylogeny, based on a rigorous cladistic analysis, is presented. The\ncladistic biogeographical analysis of the Coryciinae s. str. shows that\nit is a member of the Afrotemperate Track, with a pattern of vicariance\nevents typical of the members of this track. An analysis of the patterns\nof speciation shows that allopatric speciation appears to be rare, and\nthat parapatric speciation across edaphic boundaries may be the most\nimportant factor. Proceeding from the information presented, a new\nclassification of the group is proposed in which we recognize the four\ngenera Ceratandra, Evotella, Pterygodium and Corycium. The new monotypic\ngenus Evotella comprises a species originally described as Pterygodium\nrubiginosum. The three species of the genus Anochilus are transferred to\nCorycium and Pterygodium. P. magnum, which was originally described as\nPterygodium but was transferred to Corycium lately, is placed in a\nmonotypic section of Pterygodium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coryciinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1673.phy"}]}
