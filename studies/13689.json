During the course of this\nstudy, several species could be distinguished from I. radicicola sensu\nstricto based on morphological and culture characteristics. DNA sequence\nanalysis of the partial β-tubulin, histone H3, translation elongation\nfactor 1-α and nuclear ribosomal RNA-Internal Transcribed Spacer\n(nrRNA-ITS) genes were employed to provide further support for the\nmorphological species resolved among 68 isolates associated with root\nrot disease symptoms. Of the various loci screened, nrRNA-ITS sequences\nwere the least informative, while histone H3 sequences were the most\ninformative, resolving the same number of species as the combined\ndataset across the four genes. Within the Ilyonectria radicicola species\ncomplex, 12 new taxa are delineated occurring on a diverse range of\nhosts, the most common being Cyclamen, Lilium, Panax, Pseudotsuga,\nQuercus and Vitis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilyonectria radicicola species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59183.phy"}]}
