Multigene phylogenetic analyses with the nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, Î²-tubulin (benA) and\ncalmodulin (cmd) genes, as well as morphological analyses revealed that\nthese isolates were in the Penicillium section Ramosa. These isolates\nwere closely related to P. lenticrescens and P. soppii in terms of\nmultigene phylogeny, but their colonies and micro-morphological\ncharacters differed from these closest related species. We consider that\nthese isolates constitute a new species in the genus Penicillium section\nRamosa and propose the name P. chroogomphum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96583","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96583.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96584","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96584.phy"}]}
