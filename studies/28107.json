Within\nthese were 31 species that he described as Hebeloma or that later\nauthors recombined into Hebeloma. These 31 taxa have been analyzed, both\nmorphologically and molecularly, as far as possible. For six of these\nspecies, lectotypes are designated. For twelve species, ITS sequences\nwere generated. Thirteen of the species analyzed are Hebeloma, as the\ngenus is delimited today. Of these 13, nine are regarded as ‘current’,\ni.e. are names that should be accepted and used. Of the remaining four,\nthree are synonymized with earlier Peck species and one with the genus\ntype H. mesophaeum. Numerous Hebeloma species described from America are\nsynonymized with some of Pecks species, such as H. albidulum, H. album,\nH. colvinii, H. excedens, H. palustre, H. sordidulum or H. velatum;\nPecks H. album, H. palustre and H. velatum are earlier names for H.\nfragilipes, H. clavulipes and H. dunense, respectively. All three names\nwere in current use, described from Europe. The 18 species that are not\nHebeloma belong to a range of genera: Agrocybe, Hemistropharia, Inocybe,\nInosperma, Naucoria (Alnicola) and Pholiota; four species that were not\npreviously recombined into their respective genera are here recombined.\nTwo taxa, that are not Hebeloma, remain unresolved. Fifty-nine later\nHebeloma species described from the US are synonymized with Peck species\nand seven with H. mesophaeum, 36 of these supported by sequence data.\nUpdates on two species, H. petrakii and H. remyi, from Europe, are also\ngiven, and a lectotype and epitype selected for the latter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131035.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131026","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131027","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131039.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131036.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131040.phy"}]}
