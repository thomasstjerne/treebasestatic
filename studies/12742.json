A recent analysis of shared\nmicroRNA families found that turtles are more closely related to\nlepidosaurs. To test this hypothesis with data from many single-copy\nnuclear loci dis- persed throughout the genome, we used sequence\ncapture, high-throughput sequencing and pub- lished genomes to obtain\nsequences from 1145 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and their vari- able\nflanking DNA. The resulting phylogeny provides overwhelming support for\nthe hypothesis that turtles evolved from a common ancestor of birds and\ncrocodilians, rejecting the hypothesized relationship between turtles\nand lepidosaurs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Turtles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52988.phy"}]}
