The\ntaxonomy of Ruppia has been confused by simplified morphology with its\nhigh phenotypic plasticity as well as the existence of polyploidy and\nputative hybrid. This study aimed to address the current classification\nof species in the genus, the origin of putative hybrids and polyploids.\nMethods: Separate molecular phylogenetic analyses using plastid DNA and\nnuclear-encoded phyB data sets were performed after chromosome\nobservations and reevaluated morphology thereafter. Key Results: The\nresultant trees were largely congruent between genomes, but were\nincongruent in two respects: the first incongruence may be caused by\nlong outgroup branches and their effect on ingroup rooting and the\nsecond one is caused by the existence of heterogeneous phyB sequences\nfor several accessions that may reflect several independent\nhybridization events. Several morphological species recognized in\nprevious taxonomic revisions appear paraphyletic in plastid DNA and phyB\ntrees. Conclusions: Given the molecular phylogenies, and considering\nchromosome number and morphology, three species and one species complex\ncomprising six lineages were discerned. A putative allotriploid, an\nallotetraploid, and a lineage of hybrid origin were identified within\nthe species complex, and a hybrid was found outside the species complex,\nand their respective putative parental taxa were inferred. With respect\nto biogeography, a remarkably discontinuous distribution was identified\nin two cases, for which bird-mediated seed dispersal may be a reasonable\nexplanation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9276.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9277.phy"},{"tree_label":"RuppiaPhyB 38Fdw ML","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9280.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9281.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9284.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9275","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9275.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9283","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9283.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9282.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9285.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9278","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9278.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9279","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9279.phy"}]}
