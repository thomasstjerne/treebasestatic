If\nfound to be detrimental to the yield and/or quality of cocoa beans, the\nvirus could represent a potential new threat to cacao cultivation. This\ndiscovery highlights the importance of implementing molecular diagnostic\nassays and quarantine efforts to prevent the spread of badnaviruses.\nAdditional studies are needed to determine the distribution of CaMMV in\ncommercial fields in Puerto Rico and other cacao-growing areas in the\nAmericas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122738","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122738.phy"}]}
