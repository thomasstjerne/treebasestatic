They potentially contain unique,\nextremotolerant biota, which cannot be detected with nonsequence-based\nmethods. Using high-throughput sequencing of highly variable domains of\nthe 18S rRNA gene we investigated Holomycota communities associated with\norganic matter and pore water in oxygen-depleted horizons of a boreal\npeatland. To avoid taxonomic bias, we targeted the entire Opisthokonta\nusing different DNA extraction kits, polymerases, and primers with wide\ntaxonomic coverage. We identified novel lineages of early-diverging\nHolomycota and support the lineages recently anticipated in other\nresearch. Many of the identified taxa are unicellular and\nextremotolerant Eumycota, including ecologically specific\nrepresentatives of Neocallimastigomycota and Wallemiomycetes.\nRozellomycota (known as Rozellida, Cryptomycota, and Microsporidia) were\nrepresented by all major clades, except for putatively marine lineages,\nillustrating that deep oxygen-depleted horizons of boreal peatland serve\nas repositories of early-diverging Holomycota species. Rozellomycota\nsequences accounted for 25Â–80% of the Holomycota sequences, suggesting\nthat this group may contribute a lot into fungal communities functioning\nin peatlands.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Microsporidia tree","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microsporidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114953.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ascomycota tree","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114954.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chytridiomycota tree","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytridiomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114955.phy"},{"tree_label":"Basidiomycota tree","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114956.phy"},{"tree_label":"Holomycota tree","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114952.phy"}]}
