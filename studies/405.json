We review the two main strategies for accomplishing this\n(combining raw data versus combining trees), but employ a relatively new\nvariant of the latter: supertree construction. The utility of one\nsupertree technique, matrix representation using parsimony analysis\n(MRP), is demonstrated by deriving a complete phylogeny for all 271\nextant species of the Carnivora from 177 literature sources. Beyond\nproviding a consensus estimate of carnivore phylogeny, the tree also\nindicates taxa for which the relationships remain controversial (e.g.,\nthe red panda; within canids, felids, and hyaenids) or have not been\nstudied in any great detail (e.g., herpestids, viverrids, and\nintrageneric relationships in the procyonids). Times of divergence\nthroughout the tree were also estimated from 74 literature sources based\non both fossil and molecular data. We use the phylogeny to show that\nsome lineages within the Mustelinae and Canidae contain significantly\nmore species than expected for their age, illustrating the treeâ€™s\nutility for studies of macroevolution. It will also provide a useful\nfoundation for comparative and conservational studies involving the\ncarnivores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaenidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3380.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lutrinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3372.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phocidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3373.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carnivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3367.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11B","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Herpestidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3368.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11A","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Herpestidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Canidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mephitinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Felidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3374.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mustelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3375.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Viverridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3376.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Otariidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3377.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Procyonidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3378.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ursidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3379.phy"}]}
