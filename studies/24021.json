The lack of useful morphological traits and the high degree of\nvariation therein complicate species identifications in Cercospora.\nRecent studies have revealed multi-gene DNA sequence data to be highly\ninformative for species identification in Cercospora. During the present\nstudy, Cercospora isolates obtained from Crownvetch (Securigera varia)\nin Iran and Romania were subjected to an eight-gene (ITS, tef1, actA,\ncmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh) analysis. By applying a polyphasic\napproach including morphological characteristics, host data, and\nmolecular analyses, the isolates were identified as C. rautensis. To our\nknowledge, this is the first record of C. rautensis from Iran (Asia). In\naddition, an epitype is designated here for C. rautensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the GPD alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116129","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116129.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the HIS alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116126","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116126.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the CAl alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116125","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116125.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the TEF alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116122","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116122.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116119.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the TUB alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116127","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116127.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Bayesian analysis of the ACT alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116124","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116124.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the ITS alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116121","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian analysis of the RPB2 alignment","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116128","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116128.phy"}]}
