Molecular data were obtained from 34 individuals\nthat represent 11 species in Lentinus, nine in the Polyporaceae, eight\nin the Tricholomataceae, and one in the Corticiaceae. Thanetephorus\ncucumeris (Tulasnellales) was used as an outgroup for rooting purposes.\nMost of the sequence variation was in regions that correspond to\neukaryote-specific divergent domains D1 and D2. Molecular data alone\nyielded a well-resolved cladogram but morphological data alone were\ninsufficient to resolve phylogenetic relationships. The most resolved\ncladograms were obtained with a combined analysis of molecular and\nmorphological characters. Bootstrap and decay index measures of branch\nrobustness had a significant positive correlation, but some branches\nwith high bootstrap values were contradicted by near-minimal trees.\nMonophyly of Lentinus sensu Pegler was not supported. Rather, three\nmonophyletic groups of Lcntinus species were resolved. These largely\ncorrespond to Ncolcntinus, Panus, and Lentinus s. str. The latter\nappears to be derived from the Polyporaceae, suggesting that lamellae\nare products of convergent evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lentinus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_188.phy"}]}
