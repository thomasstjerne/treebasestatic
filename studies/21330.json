The\nfungus produced hyaline, unique-shaped conidia consisting of a\nhook-shaped main axis and three arms at the helicoid part of the main\naxis. Based on its conidial development and morphological\ncharacteristics, we confirmed that this is a novel fungus and described\nit as Hamatispora phuquocensis gen. et sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses of\nH. phuquocensis based on the LSU nrDNA sequences showed that it clusters\nwith Microthyrium spp. and belongs to Microthyriales","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Hamatispora based on 28S sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105881.phy"}]}
