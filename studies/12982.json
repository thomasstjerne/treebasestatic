The specimen shows an unique combination of\nplesiomorphic and potentially autapomorphic features: very thick and\nbroad bone with a complex saddle-shaped dorsal surface, and a narrow\nvertical lamina between the prefrontal and lacrimal facets. This study\nsupports the hypothesis that a fourth large theropod was present in the\nCenomanian of Morocco together with Carcharodontosaurus, Deltadromeus\nand Spinosaurus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carcharodontosaurids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55066.phy"}]}
