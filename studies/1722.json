Resolution of relationships within Encelia has\ntraditionally been difficult because there is some morphological overlap\namong species, and species undergo hybridization when sympatric. In this\nstudy, we used DNA sequence data from two nuclear regions (ITS and ETS)\nand two chloroplast regions (psbA-trnH and trnS-trnfM) to infer\nphylogenetic relationships among 19 species, subspecies, and varieties\nof Encelia. Eight species of Enceliopsis, Geraea, Simsia, and Bahiopsis\nwere also included as outgroups. These data support previous hypotheses\nsuggesting that Encelia is monophyletic and sister to Enceliopsis +\nGeraea. In addition, our data provide evidence for two major subclades\nwithin Encelia that are supported by morphological synapomorphies.\nHowever, little differentiation was observed among species of Encelia\nwithin subclades. This lack of differentiation may be the result of a\nrecent diversification of the genus including a recent expansion and\nradiation in the Peninsular Desert.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Encelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4760.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Encelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4761.phy"}]}
