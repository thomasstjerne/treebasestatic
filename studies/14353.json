Their independent\nspecies status is demonstrated in phylogenetic analyses using nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast trnLF\nintron-spacer sequences. The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships\nwith their congeners is discussed from a morphological point of view.\nMorphological convergences, particularly of the flower, appear to\ncharacterize this calciphilous genus. Preliminary results based on the\nmaterial included, phylogenetic relationships inferred and geographic\ndistributions, the limestone area in Southeast Yunnan and West Guangxi\nappears as the center of origin and diversification of Petrocodon, with\nseparate range expansions to eastern karst regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocodon (Gesneriaceae) ITS trnLF combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_64143.phy"}]}
