Three new Distoseptispora species, D. meilingensis, D.\nyongxiuensis and D. yunjushanensis from submerged decaying bamboo culms\nin Jiangxi Province, China, were discovered based on phylogenetic\nanalyses and morphological characters. The combined data of\nITS-LSU-SSU-tef1 sequence analyses were used to infer the phylogenetic\nrelationship between D. meilingensis, D. yongxiuensis, D. yunjushanensis\nand related species. Both molecular analyses and morphological data\nsupport D. meilingensis, D. yongxiuensis and D. yunjushanensis as three\nindependent taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135757","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135757.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135758.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135759.phy"}]}
