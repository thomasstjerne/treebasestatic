Total genomic DNA from one outgroup (Larix occidentalis\nNutt.) and five Pseudotsuga species from Japan mainland China, Taiwan,\nand North America were digested with 20 restriction enzymes, blotted,\nand probed up to 17 times with cloned DNA fragments. A total of 38\nshared fragment characters were subjected to Wagner parsimony analysis\ncoupled with bootstrapping to evaluate statistical significance of the\nphylogenetic trees. The complex patterns that we observed for actin gene\nfragments were evaluated via a Fitch-Margoliash distance-matrix\nanalysis. Both parsimony and distance-matrix analyses indicated that\nrelationships among species in the genus coincide with their current\ngeographic distribution: genetic similarity declines with migration\ndistance around the Pacific Rim. The Asian and North American species\nform well-differentiated and statistically significant monophyletic\ngroups. Pseudotsuga japonica is the Asian species closest to the North\nAmerican species. Affinities to the outgroup Larix occidentalis suggest\nthat Pseudotsuga originated in North America and then migrated into\nAsia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudostuga","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4267.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudostuga","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4266.phy"}]}
