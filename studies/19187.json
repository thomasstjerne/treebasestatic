Morphological and physiological characteristics of the isolates\nwere somewhat similar to those of the species from Clade 4 in ITS tree\nof Phytophthora spp. Analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of\nrDNA sequences indicated that the isolates were distinct from Clade 4\nspecies and they constituted a monophyletic lineage in ITS tree.\nPhylogenetic analysis of other genes such as cytoplasmic NADH\ndehydrogenase subunit I and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, as well as\nnuclear translation elongation factor 1α and β-tubulin were also placed\nthe distinct lineage in Clade 4 of the Phytophthora tree as a sister\ntaxon to P. plamivora. Investigation on the host range of the isolates\nshowed that they could infect some annual as well as perennial plants\nother than Christs thorn. Based on phylogenetic analysis, and\nmorphological and physiological characteristics these isolates were\ndistinct from other Phytophthora species and resulted in introducing\nPhytophthora banihashemiana sp. nov. as a new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95396.phy"}]}
