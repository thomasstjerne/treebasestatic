Pyrenophora bromi, the\nspecies most closely related to P. tritici-repentis, is the causal agent\nof brown leaf spot of bromegrass. Because of the relatedness of P. bromi\nand P. tritici-repentis, we investigated the possibility that P. bromi\ncontains sequences homologous to ToxA and/or ToxB, the products of which\nmay be involved in its interaction with bromegrass. Multiplex polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) revealed the presence of ToxB-like sequences in P.\nbromi and high-fidelity PCR was used to clone several of these loci,\nwhich were subsequently confirmed to be homologous to ToxB and named\nPbToxB. Additionally, Southern analysis revealed PbToxB to have a\nmulticopy nature similar to ToxB. A combination of phylogenetic and\nSouthern analyses revealed that the distribution of ToxB extends further\ninto the Pleosporaceae, and a search of available fungal genomes\nidentified a distant homolog in Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of rice\nblast. Thus, unlike most other described HSTs, ToxB homologs are present\nacross a broad range of plant pathogenic ascomycetes, suggesting its\npresence in an early ancestor of the Ascomycota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"WP tree","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5165.phy"}]}
