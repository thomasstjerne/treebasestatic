Here, we\npropose a lineage-based classification for the genus, including the\ndescription of two new series, ser. Crestatae and ser. Rinoreifoliae,\nand a new subseries in ser. Turnera, the subser. Macronectariae. A list\nof species and a key for series and subseries of Turnera are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115246.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115247.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115248.phy"}]}
