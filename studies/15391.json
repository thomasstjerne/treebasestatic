We examined its position\nrelative to this family using molecular data from the mitochondrial\nsmall subunit and nuclear large subunit rDNA. Our results revealed that\nMyeloconis forms a monophyletic group nested within Porinaceae, closely\nrelated to Porina farinosa. Neither Porina s.str. nor Clathroporina\nsensu Harris form monophyletic groups; instead, two strongly supported\nclades were recovered, which differ in ascospore septation (septate\nversus muriform), with the clade producing muriform ascospores including\nMyeloconis. We therefore reduce Myeloconidaceae to synonymy with\nPorinaceae, but as generic delimitations within Porinaceae remain\nunclear, we retain Myeloconis as a separate genus within the family. The\nspecies concept currently used in the genus, based largely on secondary\nmetabolites and ascospore measurements, is supported by the\nphylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PM ML","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Porinaceae+Myeloconidaceae mtSSU+nuLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70611.phy"},{"tree_label":"O ML","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ostropales mtSSU+nuLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70610.phy"}]}
