The taxon sample includes 101 monocots and 36\ndicots, and all four genes were sampled for all 137 taxa. Jackknife\nsupport was assessed for clades resolved by the four-gene analysis, and\ncompared to support for the same clades by each of the four three-gene\nsubset matrices, in order to quantify the degree to which each gene\ncontributed to or detracted from support for each clade. Instances of\npositively and negatively correlated support for clades by genes of the\nsame and different genomes were observed. In particular, the placement\nof Acorus within a clade that also includes Tofieldiaceae, Araceae, and\nAlismatales s.s., as opposed to its frequent placement as sister of all\nother monocots, is supported by atpA and matK. The results indicate that\ngenes from the mitochondrial genome provide a unique test of\nrelationships that have been inferred with plastid-encoded genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 2-4","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocots","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2623.phy"}]}
