Based on\nITS sequences detected only in symptomatic root tissue of Sarcococca in\nGreat Britain since 2007, it could be deduced that Sarcococca also\nharbors the same Phytophthora species. All isolates had a felty colony\npattern, contained semi-papillate sporangia and globose oogonia and had\na maximum temperature for growth of ~27 C. Phylogenetic analysis using\nITS, CoxI and EF-1Î± revealed that all sequences for each locus were\nidentical and unique and clustered in subclade 2a. In addition, a number\nof Phytophthora strains was isolated from diseased Buxus sempervirens\nplants originating from the Netherlands and Belgium, that were suffering\nfrom stem base and root rot, whereas some strains were also isolated\nfrom Acer palmatum, Choisya and Taxus in Great Britain. All isolates had\na stellate colony pattern, possessed larger semi-papillate sporangia and\nsmaller globose oogonia than the isolates from Pachysandra, and had a\nmaximum temperature for growth of ~30 C. Phylogenetic analysis using\nITS, CoxI and EF-1Î± showed that all sequences for each locus were\nidentical and unique and grouped in subclade 2a as well. Sequence\nanalysis using Ã-tubulin showed that both taxa contained identical\nsequences, that were also identical to P. himalsilva. P. himalsilva\noriginates from Asia suggesting that all three taxa recently radiated in\nAsia. Pathogenicity trials with isolates from Pachysandra on this host\nand with isolates from Buxus on this host caused disease symptoms on\ntheir respective hosts and after reisolation the identity of the\npathogens was confirmed in both cases, thus fulfilling the postulates of\nKoch.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Partial COI tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67311","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67311.phy"},{"tree_label":"Partial ITS1 tree","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67312","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67312.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr76489","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76489.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr76490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76490.phy"}]}
