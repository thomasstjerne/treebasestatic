This group of\nspecies belongs in Pluteus sect. Celluloderma based on morphological and\nmolecular characters. Two species, Pluteus multiformis, from Spain, and\nPluteus eludens, from Madeira, Russia and the U.S.A, are described as\nnew. Both species share pigmented cheilocystidia and a pileipelllis\ncomposed of both clavate-spheropedunculate and elongated elements with\nP. eugraptus, but they can be separated based on the characteristics of\nthe cystidia and pileipellis. Pluteus multiformis is characterized by\nthe scarce pleurocystidia, clavate cheilocystidia and caulocystidia and\nhighly polymorphic elements of the pileipellis. Pluteus eludens is\ncharacterized mainly by utriform pleurocystidia. Pluteus eugraptus is\nknown only with certainty from the type collection (Sri Lanka), which\nhas been reexamined here, and it is characterized by narrowly lageniform\npleurocystidia. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS region sequence data\nsupport the separation of P. multiformis, P. eludens and an additional\ncollection from Japan that likely represents the true P. eugraptus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Strict Consensus","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eugraptus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21532.phy"}]}
