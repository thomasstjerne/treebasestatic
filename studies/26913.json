Trechispora xantha is\ncharacterized by resupinate, cracked basidiomata with buff hymenial\nsurface, a monomitic hyphal system and ellipsoid, hyaline, thin-walled,\nsmooth basidiospores. Sequences of ITS and nLSU gene regions of the\nstudied samples were generated. The phylogenetic analysis based on\nmolecular data of ITS+nLSU sequences supported the novelty of these two\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127754.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127755.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125758.phy"}]}
