Since then, numerous\nstegosaurian remains have been discovered from Europe, North America,\nAfrica and Asia, and continue to be discovered regularly. Stegosaurs are\nknown from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous; no definitive\nevidence of the clade is known from younger deposits. New discoveries\nare improving our understanding of stegosaur biology and showing that\nstegosaurs were more morphologically diverse than was previously\nrealized. A new phylogeny, which includes all valid stegosaurian taxa,\nlargely agrees with previous studies and shows the European\nDacentrurinae was sister taxon to Stegosaurus. Poor resolution at the\nbase of Stegosauria is probably due to the fragmentary nature of many of\nthe Chinese taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stegosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55681.phy"}]}
