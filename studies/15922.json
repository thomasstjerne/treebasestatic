The generic\ntype W. diffractella is endemic to eastern North America and is\ncurrently delimited to include considerable morphological and ecological\nvariation. Previous molecular studies including W. diffractella have\nincluded sequences from a single specimens, which is morphologically\ndistinct and ecologically discordant from the lectotype. Here we examine\nthe delineation of W. diffractellum using ITS sequences from 21\nspecimens of W. diffractella and two specimens of E. tenuissimum, a\nclosely related Appalachians endemic. Our results show that1) E.\ntenuissimum is nested within a monophyletic W. diffractella, and thus E.\ntenuissimum is placed in synonymy, 2) morphological variation within W.\ndiffractella does not correlate with phylogeny, affirming that the\nobserved variability is infraspecific, 3) there is no phylogenetic\nstructure corresponding to biogeographic patterns within W.\ndiffractella, and 4) within W. diffractella all but one sample from\ncalcareous substrates clustered within a single well-supported lineage\nsuggesting an avenue for further study","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Willeya diffractella MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75370.phy"}]}
