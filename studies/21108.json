The main vegetative stage of V. adhaerens consisted of\nunicellular coccoid cells with cell walls, although sarcinoid colonies\nand uniflagellate zoospores were also observed. V. adhaerens had\nchloroplasts with nucleomorphs and pyrenoids that were completely\nembedded in the chloroplast. A deep plate-like invagination of the\nperiplastidal compartment (PPC) almost partitioned the pyrenoid and\nchloroplast components, which were surrounded by two membranes. The\nnucleomorph was positioned in the base of the invagination of the PPC.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses using rRNA genes showed that V.\nadhaerens branched as a sister lineage of the Amorphochlora clade. The\nsarcinoid colony, pyrenoid embedded in the chloroplast, and nucleomorph\nlocated at the base of the deep invagination of the PPC have not been\nreported in other chlorarachniophytes. Based on these morphological and\nultrastructural characteristics and the results of the molecular\nphylogenetic analyses, we propose V. adhaerens as a new genus and\nspecies of chlorarachniophyte.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TreeLSU","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree SSU","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107523.phy"}]}
