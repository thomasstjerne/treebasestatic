We\nfound that Carex tincta, clarified by thorough review of herbarium\nmaterials, has a much narrower geographic range than previously thought,\ncentering on Maine (USA), adjacent states, and adjacent portions of\nCanada with rare scattered occurrences to western Lake Superior. Carex\ntenera has traditionally been thought to consist of two varieties: the\ntranscontinental variety tenera and the upper Midwest (USA) variety\nechinodes. In light of ecological and chromosomal differences, AFLP\ngenetic distances, and morphological analysis the latter should be\nrecognized as a distinct species, Carex echinodes comb. et stat. nov.\nCarex echinodes and narrow-leaved forms of C. normalis can be\nchallenging to differentiate morphologically, but widest leaf width,\ninflorescence internode length, peduncle diameter, and growth habit\nseparate the two taxa. New chromosome numbers are reported, with those\nof C. tenera (n = 24+2III, 26, 27, 28) having a lower range than either\nthose of C. echinodes (n = 37, 38, 39) or C. normalis (n = 34, 35,\n36).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex echinodes group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5366.phy"}]}
