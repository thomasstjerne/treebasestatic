A total of 43\nisolates/specimens of Dinemasporium-like fungi were examined by\nphylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer sequences of the\nnuclear rRNA gene and morphological comparisons. Species highly\nconsistent with Diarimella or Stauronema generic concepts failed to form\nmonophyletic groups, but were scattered within the Dinemasporium clade.\nDiarimella and Stauronema are therefore treated as synonyms of\nDinemasporium. An expanded generic concept of Dinemasporium is proposed\nto accommodate species having conidia with bipolar and lateral\nappendages (formerly Stauronema) or branched multiple appendages\n(formerly Diarimella), as well as typical Dinemasporium species having\nconidia with bipolar unbranched appendages. Eight new species of\nDinemasporium â D. ambiguum, D. bambusicola, D. iriomotense, D.\njaponicum, D. parastrigosum, D. pseudodecipiens, D. rishiriense and D.\nsasae â are described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinemasporium MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70491.phy"}]}
