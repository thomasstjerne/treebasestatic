However,\nseveral asexual morph species have also been accommodated in this genus.\nIn this study, four new species of Tubeufia, viz. T. filiformis, T.\nlatispora, T. laxispora and T. mackenziei are described and illustrated.\nThe phylogenetic placement of the new species are confirmed by analysis\nof combined ITS, LSU and TEF1α sequence data. A key to Tubeufia species\nis provided and the new species are compared with similar fungal\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102306.phy"}]}
