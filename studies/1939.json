A few years ago, this\nfungus began to produce chasmothecia in various areas of Japan, which\nwere consistent with Erysiphe nankinensis (= Uncinula nankinensis), but\napparently contradictory to the characteristics of the anamorph. Based\non a molecular phylogenetic analysis using DNAs separately extracted\nfrom anamorph and teleomorph of the fungus on A. buergerianum, it could\nbe demonstrated that sequences of this fungus are sister to Sawadaea.\nDue to the anamorph belonging to Oidium subgen. Octagoidium and the\nphylogenetic position within the Sawadaea clade, the new combination\nSawadaea nankinensis is proposed for this species. The genus Sawadaea is\nemended to comprise species with consistently unbranched\nappendages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sawadaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4996.phy"}]}
