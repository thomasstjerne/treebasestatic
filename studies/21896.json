Based on\nmorphological characters and phylogeny of DNA sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region and part of the translation elongation\nfactor (TEF) 1-α gene, a new species, namely D. juglandis is described\nfrom Juglandis regia in China. In addition, about D. juglandis, we found\nthe sexual ascospore on the host. Besides, Dothiorella rosae，as another\nnovel species in China, we also described in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110598.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule Con","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110600.phy"}]}
