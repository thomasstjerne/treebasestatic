A sensitivity analysis varying gap cost and\ntransversion-transition ratio over nine parameters was implemented in\nthe sequence alignment and in the parsimony analysis. The two data\npartitions are significantly incongruent, and the neontological data\npartition includes over six times as many characters as the osteological\ndata partition. The osteological data partition, however, samples almost\nthree times more taxa, taxa that cannot be sampled for neontological\ndata because they are extinct. Osteological data resulted in artiodactyl\nmonophyly, and neontological data in artiodactyl paraphyly over all nine\nparameters. In the total evidence analysis the parameter most congruent\nwith the overall character data is unresolved as to the sister taxon of\nCetacea, however the Adams consensus tree favors the neontological\nresult. Extinction of almost 90% of the clade of interest, and\nparticularly poor knowledge of stem taxa at the base of Artiodactyla\nmake resolution of conflicting molecule- and morphology-based\nphylogenetic signals particularly difficult.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6090.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6292.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict f","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict e","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict h","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5985.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6216.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict d","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6242.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict i","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6263.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict g","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict c","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6395.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict a","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6535.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6C","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6384.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacean-Artiodactyl Question","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6412.phy"}]}
