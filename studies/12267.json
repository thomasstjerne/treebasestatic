Plants there and in the adjacent Mediterranean zone exhibit\nstriking adaptations, and we here use a species-rich such group to\naddress the question whether adaptations arose in parallel, at different\ntimes, or simultaneously. Answering this type of question has been a\nmajor concern of evolutionary biology over the past few years, with a\ngrowing consensus that lineages tend to be conservative in their\nvegetative traits and niche requirements. Combined nuclear and\nchloroplast DNA sequences for 112 species of Oxalidales (4900 aligned\nnucleotides) yielded a fossil-calibrated phylogeny that includes 43 of\nthe 54 species of Oxalis occurring in Chile. Distribution models (SDMs)\nfor these species that included precipitation, temperature, fog and/or\nvegetation types and the phylogeny were used to reconstruct ancestral\nhabitat preferences, relying on likelihood and Bayesian techniques.\nSince uneven collecting can reduce the power of SDMs, we used a\nbackground sample from 1224 Chilean Oxalis collections to correct models\nfor collecting effort. Models with just 10 of 19 bioclim parameters did\nas well as more parameter-rich models. Results reveal that the Oxalis\nflora of Chile consists of seven distant lineages that originated at\ndifferent times prior to the last Andean uplift pulse and some of which\nhad features pre-adapting them to seasonally arid or xeric conditions.\nThe Mediterranean core zone, south of the Atacama, offered an ecological\nrefuge for insufficiently arid-adapted species and harbors a mix of\nancient and young groups. There is no evidence of rapid adaptive\nradiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxalis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50488.phy"}]}
