Fibroporia albicans sp. nov. is\ndescribed and illustrated on the basis of collections originating from\nChina. Both the morphology and phylogenetic analysis of ITS rDNA\nsequences support this new species. Morphologically, it is characterized\nby resupinate, annual basidiocarps, white to cream-colored pore surface\nwhen fresh, which becoming cream to cream-buff upon drying, smaller\npores (6â“8 per mm), presence of white to cream rhizomorphs, a dimitic\nhyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, fusoid cystidioles, and\noblong to ellipsoid basidiospores; moreover, it causes a brown rot.\nMolecular phylogeny inferred from ITS sequence data suggested a close\nrelationship between Fibroporia albicans and F. citrina. Six species of\nFibroporia form a monophyletic entity with support of 100% MP and 1.00\nBPP, and the three specimens of Fibroporia albicans formed a strongly\nsupported monophyletic lineage (100% MP, 0.99 BPP) within the Fibroporia\nclade. An identification key to the Chinese species of Fibroporia is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fibroporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107808.phy"}]}
