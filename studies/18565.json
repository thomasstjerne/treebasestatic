Here two basic\nco-phylogeographic scenarios can be distinguished: a synchronous\nscenario (parasites diverge and disperse together with their hosts) and\nan asynchronous scenario (host-parasite divergences do not coincide,\ndispersing hosts acquire parasites in the new source area from unrelated\nhosts). We apply this framework to a large radiation of birds\n(Passeriformes) and a lineage of their permanent symbionts, the feather\nmite family Proctophyllodidae. We compared two time-calibration\nstrategies for mites: using fossil mite outgroups and host\nphylogeography only. Out of 11 putative co-phylogeographic events, only\nthree (e. g., the dispersal of emberizoid Passerida to the New World\nleading to the origin of the Proctophyllodes thraupis+quadratus mite\nclade) agree in timing based on both mite fossil and host-calibrated\ntrees. Timing for another event, a host shift from passerines to\nhummingbirds, generally agrees in our two time-calibration approaches,\nbut was inferred to be substantially older than the origin of\nhummingbirds, suggesting that alternative time estimates for this event\nshould be preferred. Our framework offers a more robust detection of\nhost and parasite co-phylogeographic events (as compared to using only\nhost biogeography to time-calibrate parasite trees) and provides\nindependent data for testing alternative hypotheses on timing of host\ndiversification and dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BEAST Time calibrated tree","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94091.phy"}]}
