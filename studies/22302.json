Ascocarps of exothecial fungi typically lack peridium and are\ncovered with a hymenial layer instead. Ruhlandiella have non-operculate\nasci and highly ornamented ascospores. The genus was first described by\nHennings in 1903 based on Ruhlandiella berolinensis from the Australian\ngreenhouse in a German botanical garden. R. berolinensis was later\nidentified as an ectomycorrhizal fungus associated with Eucalyptus\ntrees. Since then, mycologists have uncovered Ruhlandiella species from\nelsewhere, including Australia, Spain, Italy, and the U.S.A. Currently,\nthere are four recognized species in this genus: R. berolinensis, R.\nperegrina, R. reticulata and R. truncata. All were found near Eucalyptus\nor Acacia trees of Australasian origin. Recently, we discovered two new\nspecies of Ruhlandiella in Nothofagaceae forests in South America. They\nregularly form mitospore mats directly on soil across Patagonia. Here,\nwe formally describe these new species and construct the phylogeny of\nRuhlandiella and its related taxa using a multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalysis. Furthermore, we provide the identification key to accepted\nspecies of Ruhlandiella and also revise our current understanding of\nRuhlandiella taxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruhlandiella LSU, RPB1, RPB2, and Beta-tubulin\nconcatenated matrix","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110191.phy"}]}
