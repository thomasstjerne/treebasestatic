We specifically modelled spatial (across-site)\nheterogeneity in nucleotide frequencies, as models not incorporating\nthis heterogeneity were found to be inadequate for our data. Model\nadequacy was measured here as the ability of the model to reconstruct\nnucleotide diversity per site in the original sequence data. A potential\nnon-orthologue in the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of\nDegelia plumbea was observed. We propose a revised generic\nclassification for the Pannariaceae, accepting 30 genera, based on our\nphylogeny, previously published phylogenies, as well as available\nmorphological and chemical data. Four genera are established as new:\nAustroparmeliella (for the âParmeliellaâ lacerata group), Nebularia (for\nthe âParmeliellaâ incrassata group), Nevesia (for âFuscopannariaâ\nsampaiana), and Pectenia (for the âDegeliaâ plumbea group). Two genera\nare reduced to synonymy, Moelleropsis (included in Fuscopannaria) and\nSantessoniella (non-monophyletic; type included in Psoroma).\nLepidocollema, described as monotypic, is expanded to include 23\nspecies, most of which have been treated in the âParmeliellaâ mariana\ngroup. Homothecium and Leightoniella, previously treated in the\nCollemataceae, are here referred to the Pannariaceae. We propose 41 new\nspecies-level combinations in the newly described and re-circumscribed\ngenera mentioned above, as well as in Leciophysma and Psoroma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PhyML RPB1 majruleconsensus","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68569.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB mrSSU majruleconsensus","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae mrSSU consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68566.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyML ITS majruleconsensus","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae ITS consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68565.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB ITS majruleconsensus","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae ITS consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68564.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyML mrSSU majruleconsensus","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae mrSSU consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68567.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB concatenated majruleconsensus","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae concatenated consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68563.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB concatenated majruleconsensus","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae concatenated consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68562.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB RPB1 majruleconsensus","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68568.phy"}]}
