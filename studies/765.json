The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA repeat unit was amplified and\nsequenced for isolates of T. indica, T. walkeri, T. horrida, and a\nnumber of other taxa in the genus Tilletia. A unique restriction digest\nsite in the ITS1 region of T. walkeri was identified that distinguishes\nit from the other taxa in the genus. Phylogenetic analysis of the taxa\nbased on ITS sequence data revealed a close relationship between T.\nindica and T. walkeri, but more distant relationships between these two\nspecies and other morphologically similar taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tilletia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3839.phy"}]}
