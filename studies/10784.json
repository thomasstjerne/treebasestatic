Almost all expected phycotoxins\ncould be detected in North Sea plankton samples, with domoic acid and\n20-methyl spirolide G being most abundant. The only known source of\nspirolides is the marine thecate dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii\nand the spirolide field profiles match very well with the profile of the\nA. ostenfeldii strain S6_P12_E11, which previously had been isolated\nfrom the North Sea. Although azaspiracid-1 was the less abundant\nphycotoxin, high sensitive of the LC-MS/MS allowed for a detailed\nquantification showing highest amounts of AZA-1 were present at stations\nDK 20 and DK 21 in the 20-3 µm size fraction. A large number of crude\ncultures from these stations were established by use of serial dilution\nand screened for the presence of Azadinium-like dinoflagellates and\nAZAs. From one culture containing AZA, Azadinium spinosum was\nsubsequently isolated and brought into pure culture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootstrap
