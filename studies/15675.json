The\npresent research has focused on both morphological features and\nmultiâ“gene molecular phylogeny (nrITS, nrLSU and tef1 data sets) to\nelucidate the taxonomic status of these two rare Mediterranean boletes\nand delineate a natural classification within the family Boletaceae.\nAccurate macroâ and microscopical descriptions of the two species based\non inclusive taxon sampling are provided and supported by line drawings\nof the main anatomical features. Phylogenetic relationships, ecology,\nbiogeographic distribution and delimitation from the most closely allied\ntaxa are also highlighted. In addition, epitype collections are selected\nfor both species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alessioporus and Pulchroboletus ITS, LSU, tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74361.phy"}]}
