The taxonomy of these\npathogens has been difficult due to the use of poorly informing markers\nin phylogenetic analyses and the lack of good morphological characters.\nMany genera and families in this order have not yet been systematically\nstudied in different hosts and from different regions. In this study, a\ntotal of 29 fungal strains from the Aplosporellaceae and\nBotryosphaeriaceae were isolated from branches or twigs with symptomatic\ncanker and dieback disease in Yudu Mountain of China. Morphology and\nmultigene analyses (ITS, LSU and TEF1-Î±) indicated five distinct\nlineages, including Aplosporella javeedii, Botryosphaeria dothidea,\nDiplodia quercicola sp. nov., Phaeobotryon aplospora sp. nov. and\nPhaeobotryon rhois. Diplodia quercicola is characterized by\nmultiloculate conidiomata, producing oblong to cylindrical,\nthick-walled, hyaline, aseptate conidia. Phaeobotryon aplospora is\ncharacterized by pulvinate, multiloculate conidiomata, producing\nellipsoid to oblong, brown, aseptate conidia. The new species differ\nfrom related species phylogenetically, ecologically and morphological\nfeatures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119017.phy"}]}
