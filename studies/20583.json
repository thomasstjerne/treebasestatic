Species under the former name Eurotium,\ncurrently accommodated in section Aspergillus of the genus, are\nxerophilic fungi widely found in the human environment and able to grow\non substrates with low water activity. However, their prevalence in the\nclinical setting is poorly known. We have studied the presence of these\nspecies in a set of clinical samples from the USA using a multilocus\nsequence analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region\nof the rRNA, and fragments of the genes Î²-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin\n(CaM), and polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2). A total of 25\nisolates were studied and identified as follows: A. montevidensis (44%),\nA. chevalieri (36%), A. pseudoglaucus (8%), and A. costiformis (4%). A\nnew species Aspergillus microperforatus is also proposed, which\nrepresented 8% of the isolates studied and is characterized by\nuniseriate conidial heads, subglobose to pyriform vesicles, rough\nconidia, globose to subglose cleistothecia, and lenticular and smooth\nascospores. The in vitro antifungal activity of 8 clinically available\nantifungals was also determined against these isolates, with the\nechinocandins and posaconazole having the most potent activity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Concatenated","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102229","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102229.phy"}]}
