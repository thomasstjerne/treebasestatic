Thought to be an extremely\nlocal endemic, it was subsequently listed as a conservation priority\nspecies for the Azores, Macaronesia, and Europe, included as ‘critically\nendangered’ on the IUCN Red List, and as ‘strictly protected’ species by\nthe Bern Convention and the European Unions Habitats Directive. However,\nin this paper, we present morphological and molecular data (rbcL gene,\nrps4 gene, rps4-trnS spacer and trnL-trnF spacer sequences), which\ndemonstrate that M. azorica is conspecific with M. hirsuta, a species\nnative to Australia but widely cultivated and locally invasive in the\nSouthern United States. Based on our DNA data, we conclude that the\nAzorean plants are most likely a recent introduction to the Azores from\nFlorida. We recommend removal of the Azorean Marsilea from conservation\npriority lists. While there is so far no evidence that the small\nexisting population threatens native species, further spread in the\nAzores should be prevented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marsilea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27544.phy"}]}
