Haplotypes\nthat produced different patterns within each geographic region were\nsequenced and a database of 153 accessions of CTV was assembled.\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of seven well-defined\nclusters (Coefficient of differentiation 0.78). An asymmetric PCR ELISA\ntyping (APET) assay was developed in the frame of this clustering\npattern using a set of eight hybridization probes. The membership of any\nunknown haplotype is determined by comparing its pattern of reaction\nagainst the whole set of probes and not, as previously done in\nhybridization assays, in an all-or-nothing basis. Interpretation of the\nresults is objective and done through a visual basic application that\ncompares the rates of hydrolysis of the ELISA substrate of an assayed\nisolate to a matrix of rates of hydrolysis obtained from standard\nhaplotypes. This assay was validated and showed a better ability to\nresolve haplotypes than other assays to which it was experimentally\ncompared. It may be automated to the same extent as any ELISA\nassay.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CP","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CTV coat protein gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5336.phy"}]}
