(Poaceae). ï¬ Phylogenetic analyses were based on sequence data\nof three nuclear genes and three plastid genes from 116 accessions of\nAvena and those from outgroups. ï¬ We identify three ancestral genome\ndonors for hexaploids in Avena: x contains genome A, xx contains genome\nC, and xxx contains genome D. Molecular data indicate that\nallohexaploidy arose independently in A. sativa L. and A. nuda L., and\nspeciation occurred subsequently to polyploidization. We show that the A\nand C genomes diverged from a common ancestor ï½7 million years ago and\nthat the D genome may have originated from xxx through polyploid hybrid\nspeciation 1 to 2 million years later. ï¬ The results suggest that the\ncomplex history of reticulate evolution is at least partially\nresponsible for the taxonomic difficulty associated with Avena. The\nnewly-resolved phylogenetic framework reflects a major step forward in\nour understanding of oat biodiversity and has important implications for\nthe interpretation of oat phylogenomics","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"193","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92088.phy"},{"tree_label":"Garli best tree from GBSSI","ntax":"277","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92095.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92096.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92097.phy"}]}
