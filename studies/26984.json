Japanese isolates were divided into five clades and\nidentified as B. dothidea, B. qingyuanensis, B. sinensia, and\nBotryosphaeria sp. Two species, B. qingyuanensis and B. sinensia, have\nbeen newly added to the Japanese mycoflora, and these species were not\nhost-specific. Besides, B. tenuispora isolated from Leucothoe\nfontanesiana and insect gall on leaves of Aucuba japonica was proposed\nas a new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria its+tef+rpb2+tub2 MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126261.phy"}]}
