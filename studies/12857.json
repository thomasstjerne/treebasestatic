This gene and\nits translated protein product can harbour a selfish genetic element\ncalled an “intein” that disrupts the sequence of the host gene without\naffecting its activity. After translation, the intein peptide sequence\nself-excises precisely, producing a functional ligated host protein. In\naddition, inteins can encode homing endonuclease (HEN) domains that\npermit the possibility of lateral transfers to intein-free alleles.\nHowever, no clear evidence for their transfer between viruses has\npreviously been shown. The objective of this paper was to determine\nwhether recent transfers of inteins have occurred between Prasinoviruses\n(Phycodnaviridae) that infect the Mamiellophyceae, an abundant and\nwidespread class of unicellular green algae, by using DNA sequence\nanalyses and cophylogenetic methods. Our results suggest that transfer\namong Prasinoviruses is a dynamic ongoing process and, for the first\ntime in the Phycodnaviridae family, we showed a recombination event\nwithin an intein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein 8 Prasinovirus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein Left part BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PolB 8 Prasinovirus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PolB Prasinovirus ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53617.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PolB 8 Prasinovirus ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53618.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein 8 Prasinovirus ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53619.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein Left Part ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53620.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein Right Part ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53621.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Girus PolB ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53601.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein unbiased BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intein Right part BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Girus PolB BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PolB Prasinovirus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53580.phy"}]}
