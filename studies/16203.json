The relationships among three\ntraditionally defined and well-studied classes, Chlorophyceae,\nTrebouxiophyceae, and Ulvophyceae are of particular interest, as these\ngroups are species-rich and ecologically important worldwide. Different\nphylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed over the past two decades and\nthe monophyly of the individual classes has been disputed on occasion.\nOur study seeks to test these hypotheses by combining high throughput\nsequencing data from the chloroplast genome with increased taxon\nsampling. Our results suggest that while many of the deep relationships\nare still problematic to resolve, the classes Trebouxiophyceae and\nUlvophyceae are likely not monophyletic as currently defined. Our\nresults also support relationships among several trebouxiophycean taxa\nthat were previously unresolved. Finally, we propose that the common\nterm for the grouping of the three classes, “UTC clade”, be replaced\nwith the term “core Chlorophyta” for the well-supported clade containing\nChlorophyceae, taxa belonging to Ulvophyceae and Trebouxiophyceae, and\nthe classes Chlorodendrophyceae and Pedinophyceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77440.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77439.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77441","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77441.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77442","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77442.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77444","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77444.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77446","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77446.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 50","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77447.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 95","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77455.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 90","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77454.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 85","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77453","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77453.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 75","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77452","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77452.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 70","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77451","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77451.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 65","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77450","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77450.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 60","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77449.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 55","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77448","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77448.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 50","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77741.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 95","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77749.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 55","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77742","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77742.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 65","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77744","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77744.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 85","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77747","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77747.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 70","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77745","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77745.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 75","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77746","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77746.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 90","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77748","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77748.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 60","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77743","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77743.phy"}]}
