Conlarium duplumascospora\nis characterized by gregarious, coriaceous and beaked ascomata;\ncylindrical, unitunicate asci with a bipartite apical ring; biseriate,\nfusiform, hyaline, 0â“5- septate ascospores with or without appendages;\nand anamorph with muriform conidia. Jobellisia guangdongensis is\ncharacterized by globose to subglobose, gregarious and papillate\nascomata; three-layered peridium; cylindrical, unitunicate asci with a\nrefractive apical ring; and one-septate, fusiform, greenish brown\nascospores. Sequence analyses of partial nuclear large subunit ribosomal\nDNA (LSU rDNA) were performed to infer the phylogenetic affinities of\nthese new taxa. A key to species of Jobellisia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Jobellisia guangdongensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75826.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conlarium duplumascospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75827.phy"}]}
