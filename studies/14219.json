The\nBoletineae, with the exclusion of Hydnomerulius pinastri, was strongly\nsupported and the status of the families Boletaceae and Paxillaceae is\ndiscussed. Members of the genus Boletus are found throughout the\nphylogeny, with the majority not closely related to the type species,\nBoletus edulis. Many of the traditional, morphologically defined genera\nare not supported as monophyletic and additional sampling and taxonomic\nrevisions are needed. The majority of the Boletineae are confirmed or\nputatively ECM, but two putatively mycoparasitic lineages (one lineage\nof Buchwaldoboletus lignicola and Chalciporus piperatus and the second\nPseudoboletus parasiticus) are strongly supported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletineae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"370","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletineae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66736.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletineae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66737.phy"}]}
