The\ngenus Phaeoacremonium (Togniniaceae, Togniniales) has recently been\nmonographed, and presently contains 46 species, while its sexual morph,\nTogninia, contains 26 epithets, of which 13 are insufficiently known. In\nthis review we summarise information pertaining to the global\ndistribution, pathology, ecology, and detection of these species, and\npresent a case for retaining the genus Phaeoacremonium over that of\nTogninia. Furthermore, to obtain a single nomenclature, the following\nnew combinations are also proposed: Phaeoacremonium africanum, P.\naquaticum, P. fraxinopennsylvanicum, P. griseo-olivaceum, P.\ninconspicuum, P. leptorrhynchum, P. minimum, and P. vibratile.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeoacremonium LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91453.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeoacremonium beta-tubulin and actin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91454.phy"}]}
