The resulting tree split into two major clades: clade one\ncontained Euglena, Trachelomonas, Strombomonas, Colacium, Monomorphina,\nCryptoglena and Euglenaria; clade two contained Lepocinclis, Phacus and\nDiscoplastis. The majority of the members of Euglena were contained in\nclade A, but seven members were outside of this clade. Euglena\nlimnophila grouped with, and was thus transferred to Phacus. Euglena\nproxima was a single taxon at the base of clade one and is unassociated\nwith any clade. Five members of Euglena grouped together within clade\none and were transferred into the newly erected genus Euglenaria. The\nmonophyly of the remaining genera was supported by both analyses.\nCombining datasets resolved the relationships among ten genera of\nphotosynthetic euglenoids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euglenophyta, Three gene rooted Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6828.phy"}]}
