Few well-documented cases have been reported. A\npossible case of HHS in Medicago prostrata Jacq. was suggested\npreviously, based on only two genes and one individual. We tested\nwhether this species was formed through HHS by sampling eight nuclear\nloci and 22 individuals, with additional individuals from related\nspecies, using gene capture and Illumina sequencing. Phylogenetic\ninference and coalescent simulations were used to understand causes of\ngene tree incongruence. We found no evidence that phylogenetic\ndifferences among M. prostrata individuals were the result of HHS.\nInstead, an autopolyploid origin of tetraploids with introgression from\ntetraploids of the M. sativa complex is likely. We argue that tetraploid\nM. prostrata individuals constitute a new species, characterised by a\npartially non-overlapping distribution and distinctive alleles (from the\nM. sativa complex). No gene flow from tetraploid to diploid M. prostrata\nis apparent, suggesting partial reproductive isolation. Thus, speciation\nvia autopolyploidy appears to have been reinforced by introgression.\nThis raises the intriguing possibility that introgressed alleles may be\nresponsible for the increased range exploited by tetraploid M. prostrata\nwith respect to that of the diploids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Medicago prostrata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98649.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene109","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98652.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene119","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98653.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene147","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98654","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98654.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene148","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98655.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene150","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98656","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98656.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene103","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98650.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule gene107","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98651.phy"}]}
