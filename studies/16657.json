However, such\na study has yet to be conducted in lichenized fungi  an extremely\nsuccessful and diverse group of fungi. Analysing the most comprehensive\ntime-calibrated phylogenies with a new analytical method, we illustrated\ndrastically different diversification dynamics between two hyper-\ndiverse families of lichenized fungi, Graphidaceae and Parmeliaceae,\nwhich represent more than a fourth of the total species diversity of\nlichenized fungi. Despite adopting a similar nutrition mode and having a\nsimilar number of species, Graphidaceae exhibited a lower speciation\nrate, while Parmeliaceae showed a sharp increase in speciation rate that\ncorresponded with the aridification during the Oligocene-Miocene\ntransition, suggesting their adaptive radiation into a novel arid\nhabitat.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"219","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Graphidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88016.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"312","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parmeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88017.phy"}]}
