The earliest diverse archosaur\nfaunal assemblages are known from the Middle Triassic (c.Â 244 Ma),\nimplying that the archosaur radiation began in the Early Triassic\n(252.3-247.2 Ma). Understanding of this radiation is currently limited\nby the poor early fossil record of the group in terms of skeletal\nremains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55291","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55291.phy"}]}
