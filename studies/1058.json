Additional ultrastructural characteristics were\nused to determine their mode of nutrition. We investigated\nultrastructural morphology of the type species Tuberculina persicina and\ndetermined base sequences from the D1/D2 region of the nuclear large\nsubunit ribosomal DNA of the three commonly distinguished Tuberculina\nspecies T. maxima, T. persicina, and T. sbrozzii. Analyses of sequence\ndata by means of a Bayesian method of phylogenetic inference using a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo technique reveal the basidiomycetous nature of\nTuberculina. Within the Urediniomycetes, Tuberculina clusters as sister\ngroup of Helicobasidium, in close relationship to the rusts\n(Uredinales). This phylogenetic position is supported by the uredinalean\narchitecture of septal pores in Tuberculina. In addition, we present\naspects of the ultrastructural morphology of the cellular interaction of\nTuberculina and rusts showing a unique interaction with large fusion\npores. That indicates actual mycoparasitism of Tuberculina on its close\nrelatives, the rusts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urediniomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5810.phy"}]}
