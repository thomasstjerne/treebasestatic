The limits and status of several taxa have\nbeen contested based on morphological grounds, and clarification of\nthese limits is necessary for the design and implementation of effective\nand fiscally responsible protection and management plans. The objectives\nof this study were to investigate the monophyly of Conradina and its\nrelationship to other related mints which are endemic to the\nsoutheastern United States, to understand the patterns of\ndiversification in Conradina, and to clarify species relationships. A\nmolecular phylogeny was inferred by sequencing ITS and plastid regions\nfrom multiple accessions of each species of Conradina and individuals\nfrom Clinopodium, Dicerandra, Piloblephis, Stachydeoma, Monarda,\nPycnanthemum, and Mentha. ITS sequence data strongly support the\nmonophyly of Conradina, in agreement with evidence from morphology. In\ncontrast, plastid sequence data do not support a monophyletic Conradina\nand place Conradina as paraphyletic to Clinopodium, Stachydeoma, and\nPiloblephis spp. Similar plastid haplotypes are shared by different\ngenera, perhaps due to shared ancestral polymorphisms, or more likely,\nintrogression that occurred recently or during the Pleistocene. Within\nConradina, ITS sequence data do not resolve species-level relationships,\nwhile plastid sequence data do not support the monophyly of most\ntraditionally-defined species of Conradina that are distinguishable\nmorphologically. Species-level relationships in the plastid data set may\nalso be obscured by introgression or ancestral polymorphism. More\nrapidly evolving sequence data from nuclear markers will be necessary to\nclarify relationships in Conradina and related southeastern mints.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS ML12","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2105.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2100.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML7","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2101.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML6","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2102.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML14","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2103.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML13","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2104.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML11","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2106.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML10","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2107.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML9","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2108.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML8","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2109.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2110.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2111.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2112.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2113.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2115.phy"},{"tree_label":"CP ML1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2116.phy"},{"tree_label":"CP ML2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conradina and other scrub mints","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2117.phy"}]}
