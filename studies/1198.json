The bilabiate florets,\nsmooth style branches, caudate anthers, and pollen grains size and\nshape, exine structure and sculpture, and endoaperture shape place it\nclose to the South American genera of the tribe Mutisieae (Asteraceae)\ncentered in the Guayana Shield. Two morphology-based phylogenetic\nanalyses, one using Gochnatia and the other using Chaetanthera as\noutgroups, and including Salcedoa and the 12 Guayanan genera were\nperformed to determine the sister group relationships of Salcedoa. The\nresults suggest that Salcedoa is sister to Gongylolepis. The unusual\ndistributional pattern of Salcedoa and the Guayanan genera were explored\nthrough the dispersal-vicariance method. A trans-oceanic dispersal of\nfruits is postulated as a probable mechanism by which Salcedoa reached\nHispaniola from a South American ancestor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caribbean Mutisieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caribbean Mutisieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caribbean Mutisieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1833.phy"}]}
