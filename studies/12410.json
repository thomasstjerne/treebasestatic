Calibration is sensitive\nto evolutionary model parameters, partitioning schemes and clock model.\nHowever, the way in which these and other analytical aspects affect both\nthe rates and the resulting clade ages from calibrated phylogenies are\nnot yet well understood. To investigate these aspects we have conducted\ncalibration analyses for the genus Carabus (Coleoptera, Carabidae) on\nfive mitochondrial and four nuclear DNA fragments with 7888 nt total\nlength, testing different clock models and partitioning schemes to\nselect the most suitable using Bayes Factors comparisons. Results:\nResults support an origin of the genus Carabus during the Oligocene in\nthe Eurasian continent followed by a Miocene differentiation that\noriginated all main extant lineages. We used these data to investigate\nthe effect of ambiguous character and outgroup inclusion on both rates\nof molecular evolution and TMRCA of Carabus. We found a considerable\nvariation in rates of molecular evolution depending on the fragment\nstudied (ranging from 5.02% in cob to 0.26% divergence/My in LSU-A), but\nalso on analytical conditions. Alternative choices of clock model,\npartitioning scheme, treatment of ambiguous characters, and outgroup\ninclusion resulted in rate increments ranging from 28% (HUWE1) to 1000%\n(LSU-b and ITS2) and increments in the TMRCA of Carabus ranging from\n8.4% (cox1-a) to 540% (ITS2). Conclusions: The combination of several\ngenes is found the best strategy to minimise both the idiosyncratic\nbehaviors of individual markers and the effect of analytical aspects in\nrate and age estimations. Our results highlight the importance of\nestimating rates of molecular evolution for each specific dataset,\nselecting for optimal clock and partitioning models as well as other\nmethodological issues potentially affecting rate estimation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cytb FFTNS 20 2P SC","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carabus","tree_kind":"Species
