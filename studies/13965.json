This new species morphologically resembles\nM. capraearum and M. epiphylla in having subcuticular teliospores with a\nthickened apical wall, but it differs from these two species in its\namphigenous telia. In addition, this new species differs from M.\ncapraearum in its relatively slender teliospores and thinner apical\nthickness of teliospores, and it also differs from M. epiphylla in the\ndimension of urediniospores, the position of teliospores and the apical\nthickness of teliospores. Phylogenetic analyses using partial sequences\nof the D1/D2 region of nuclear large subunit and the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) regions including 5.8S of ribosomal\nRNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1Î±) gene\nrevealed that this rust fungus was distinct from its morphologically\nsimilar species, M. capraearum and M. epiphylla.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora sinica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67867.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora sinica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67868.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora sinica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora sinica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67866.phy"}]}
