Universal phylogenetic trees constructed with the\naddition of these sequences indicate monophyly of Archaea, with modest\nbootstrap support. The data also show a specific relationship between\nlow-temperature marine Archaea and some hot spring Archaea. Two of the\nenvironmental sequences are enigmatic: depending upon the dataset and\nanalytical method used, these sequences branch deeply within the\nCrenarchaeota, below the bifurcation between Crenarchaeota and\nEuryarchaeota, or as the sister group to eukarya. If additional data\nconfirm either of the latter two placements, then the organisms\nrepresented by these ribosomal RNA sequences would merit recognition as\na new kingdom.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Obsidian Pool community","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3255.phy"}]}
