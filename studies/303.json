The conidia are\nnonpigmented, sickle-shaped and formed from conidiogenous cells forming\npart of the conidioma wall. This anamorph is compared to anamorphs of\nother Chaenothecopsis species. In a cladistic analysis the distribution\nof different type of anamorphs in Chaenothecopsis are mapped.\nHyphomycetous anamorphs from cultures are reported for the first time in\nChaenothecopsis pusilla, C. pusiola and C. tasmanica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaenothecopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1429.phy"}]}
