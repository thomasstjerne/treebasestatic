DSW705 (=NBRC 110037), a producer of antitumor cyclic\ndepsipeptides rakicidins A and B, together with the features of this\nstrain and generation, annotation, and analysis of the genome sequence.\nThe 6.8 Mb genome of Micromonospora sp. DSW705 encodes 6,219 putative\nORFs, of which 4,846 are assigned with COG categories. The genome\nharbors at least three type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters,\none nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters, and three\nhybrid PKS/NRPS gene clusters. A hybrid PKS/NRPS gene cluster encoded in\nScaffold02 is responsible for rakicidin synthesis. DNA database search\nindicated that the biosynthetic gene clusters for depsipeptides bearing\n4-amino-2,4-pentadienoate (APDA) are widely present in taxonomically\ndiverse actinomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Micromonospora sp.
