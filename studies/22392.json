The new species is\nmorphologically very similar to C. dulciolens but is distinguished from\nthat species by having vivid mauve-violet lamellae when young, reduced\nverrucose spore ornamentation, a less pronounced plage, and the presence\nof abundant clamp connections in the epicuticular hyphae. A molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and RNA\npolymerase second largest subunit (RPB2) found that C. atropileatus is\nsister to a clade containing C. dulciolens and the sequestrate C.\nbeeverorum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110722","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110722.phy"}]}
