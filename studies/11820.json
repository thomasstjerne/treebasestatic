The purpose of\nthis study was to examine the phylogenetic relationships between this\nfungus and some presumably related taxa. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA\nsequences coding for the small ribosomal subunits of some Tritirachium\nspecies revealed their basidiomycetous nature. The topologies showed\nthat they represent a highly supported clade in the Basidiomycota. The\nmorphologically similar Nodulisporium cylindroconium, previously\ndescribed as Tritirachium sp A, clustered with the Tritirachium species\nwithin the Pucciniomycotina. It could not be retained in Tritirachium\nbecause of its different conidiogenesis. Consequently, a new genus,\nParatritirachium, is proposed for it.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tritirachium belonging to Basidiomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47875.phy"}]}
