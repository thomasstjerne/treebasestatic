A total of four subspecies of C. abrasus have been described\nto date, all widespread in South America: C. a. mastivus (Thomas, 1911),\nC. a. brachymeles (Peters, 1865), C. a. cerastes (Thomas, 1901) and C.\na. abrasus (Temminck, 1827). Here, we evaluated the phylogenetic\nrelationships within Cynomops, and the status of the four C. abrasus\nsubspecies using complete sequences of two mitochondrial genes (Cyt b\nand COI) and 39 morphological characters. Maximum-parsimony,\nmaximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions recovered a\nnovel hypothesis for Cynomops, supported the recognition of C. a.\nmastivus as a distinct species, separated from C. abrasus, and two\nhypotheses of lineages previously unrecognized for Cynomops. The use of\nmitochondrial genes combined with morphological characters revealed\nagain to be a powerful tool to recover the phylogenetic relationships\nwithin Cynomops and demonstrated that the genus is more diverse than\npreviously thought.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109103","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109103.phy"}]}
