Research to understand this\ncomplex have been particularly noticeable in East Asia. In the present\npaper, the complex was studied at a larger scale, including samples from\nMesoamerica. Inonotus linteus, an epitype of this species being\ndesignated here, is circumscribed as a narrow sense based on\nmorphological and phylogenetic data, and this has lead to delimiting a\nnew species from Mesoamerica, viz. I. cubensis, and provides evidence\nfor two additional species, I. alpinus and I. zonatus, from East Asia.\nPhylogenetic analyses of ITS sequences also con- firmed the status of I.\nbaumii, I. linteus, I. lonicericola, I. lonicerinus, I. vaninii, I.\nsanghuang, I. weigelae and I. weirianus as distinct taxa, while I.\ntenuicontextus is consid- ered to be a synonym of I. weigelae. A key to\n11 species in the complex is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inonotus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57562.phy"}]}
