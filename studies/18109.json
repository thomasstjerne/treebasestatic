Careful analysis of\navailable data allows strategic augmentation with new sequences in order\nto maximize taxonomic sampling and coverage of informative loci. I\ninferred relationships among 179 species (76%) in the avian family\nPicidae (woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks), using publicly available\nsequence data supplemented with targeted sequencing to increase\nspecies-level and locus-level sampling and maximize resolution. Results\nof these analyses generally corroborate previous molecular studies, with\nconsensus on the membership of most genera and tribes. However, several\nnewly placed taxa show surprising affinities, and several genera as\ncurrently delineated appear to be paraphyletic. Relationships among\nmajor clades of Picidae remain poorly resolved, particularly among the\nthree lineages of piculets, the unusual woodpecker genus Hemicircus, and\nthe remaining woodpeckers, and among the major groups of true\nwoodpeckers (Picinae). Phylogenomic approaches may be necessary to\nresolve these deep relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STAR all","ntax":"178","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89821","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89821.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML all ML","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89819","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89819.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML mtDNA ML","ntax":"178","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89822","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89822.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML nuDNA ML","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89823.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes all 50perc maj","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89820","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89820.phy"}]}
