We\nredefine the genus based on combined morphological and molecular\nanalyses. Phyrella unlike most dendrochirotids eviscerate posteriorly.\nThe number of tentacles is variable (14-20), as is the degree of\nfragmentation of the calcareous ring, calling into question the\nseparation of Phyllophorinae and Semperiellinae, and suggest that\nSemperiella and Thyonidiella are synonymous with Phyrella. We recognize\nfive species in Phyrella (Phyllophorus trapezus Clark, 1932,\nPhyllophorus fragilis Mitsukuri & Ohshima, 1912 (synonymized with\nThyonidiella oceana Heding & Panning, 1954), Phyllophorus thyonoides\nClark, 1938, Semperiella drozdovi Levin & Stepanov, 1999, and\nPhyrella mookiei), assign three others provisionally Lipotrapeza ambigua\nCherbonnier, 1988 (synonymized with Phyllophorus contractura\nCherbonnier, 1988 and Thyonidiella cherbonnieri Rowe & Richmond,\n2004), Phyllophorus bedoti Koehler, 1895, and Orcula tenera Ludwig,\n1875, considering the last two species inquirenda. Phyrella aculeatus\n(Ludwig, 1894), is transferred to Euthyonidiella. Orcula (Phyllophorus?)\ndubia Bedford, 1899, Thyonidiella exigua Cherbonnier, 1988 and\nThyonidiella kungi Oâ€™Loughlin, 2012 are provisionally transferred to\nPhyllophorus sensu lato, the first is considered species inquirenda.\nMolecular phylogenetic analysis recovers a well-supported Phyrella, but\nsuggests that some genera and subfamilies of Phyllophoridae are not\nmonophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllophoridae COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70119.phy"}]}
