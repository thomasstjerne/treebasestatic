The fungus is generically distinct in the\nnature of the pyriform, golden conidiogenous cell with a solitary\nterminal pore and the ellipsoidal, distoseptate, phragmoconidia that\ngerminate from each end and that have a rarely noted internal hilum\nquite unlike the hilum of the conidiogenous cell. The new fungus is\ncompared with the type species of a number of allied genera of\nhyphomycetes. Free spores of the fungus were trapped in air, honeydew\nsap and rainwater samples. Aerobiological studies showed that the spores\nare infrequent in the air, whereas their concentration increased with\nhigher atmospheric pressure. Pyrigemmula aurantiaca lives in bark\nfissures and rarely becomes airborne and the spores are mainly dispersed\nby rain splash.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrigemmula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50212.phy"}]}
