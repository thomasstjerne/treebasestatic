A new theropod,\nKayentaventor elysiae, gen. et sp. nov., is described here, representing\nthe first occurrence of the Tetanurae from the Kayenta Formation and the\nmost primitive member of this diverse theropod clade yet found in North\nAmerica. It should be noted that this specimen was originally assigned\nto Syntarsus kayentakatae (Rowe,1989); careful study of the specimen in\nquestion shows that this diagnosis is incorrect, as discussed\nherein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetanurans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55561.phy"}]}
