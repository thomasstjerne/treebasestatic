Zuolong has a large, inclined\nquadrate foramen that extends onto the medial surface of the\nquadratojugal, an unusually large fovea capitis on the femoral head, and\nan apomorphically large distal condyle of metatarsal III with a medially\nprojecting flange on the extensor surface. Radiometric dating of the\nShishugou Formation constrains the age of the specimen to the beginning\nof the Late Jurassic (Oxfordian). A cladistic analysis of Zuolong\nsalleei in a broadly sampled theropod data matrix recovers it as a basal\ncoelurosaur. These data make Zuolong one of the oldest coelurosaur\nfossils yet known that preserves both cranial and postcranial\nbones.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 18","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"coelurosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55553.phy"}]}
