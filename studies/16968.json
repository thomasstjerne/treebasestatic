Our evidence supports\nits affinity with P. barretoi and P. nummularium, from Brazil, from\nwhich it has been probably diverged by vicariant speciation. The limited\navailable material of the new species was previously identified as P.\npumilum or P. minus. A new key to the species of the core Notata group\nis provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tnt 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87169.phy"}]}
