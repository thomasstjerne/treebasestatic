In this study, the traditional morphology-based\nspecies and genus delimitations were tested using the phylogenetic\nmarkers ITS, mcm7 and mtSSU. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood approaches\nwere used on a dataset of 82 taxa to reconstruct phylogenetic\nrelationships between the eight most common species of Bagliettoa.\nMolecular data confirmed the placement of B. limborioides, the generic\ntype, within the clade including species usually considered as part of\nthe genus Bagliettoa. Five other species were monophyletic and well\nsupported (B. baldensis, B. calciseda, B. cazzae, B. marmorea and B.\nparmigerella). Relationships within a clade including B. parmigera, B.\nsteineri and specimens with intermediate characters (here referred to as\nB. cf. suzaeana) are not resolved and weakly supported. This species\ncomplex (also called B. parmigera s.l.) is in need of a further\nrevision. After revision of the type material, a lectotype is chosen for\nBagliettoa parmigerella (Zahlbr.) Vězda & Poelt. Additionally, the\nnew combinations Bagliettoa rubrocincta (Breuss) Gueidan & Cl. Roux\nand Bagliettoa suzaeana (Servít) Gueidan & Cl. Roux are proposed\nbased on their morphological similarity to other species of Bagliettoa.\nA key to the 12 currently recognised species are provided, which will\nhopefully help ecologists and biogeologists to identify species from\nthis difficult genus of endolithic lichens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mcm7 unrooted","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bagliettoa mcmc7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76796.phy"},{"tree_label":"combined","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bagliettoa allG","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76832.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtSSU unrooted","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bagliettoa mtSSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76797.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS unroot","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bagliettoa ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76795.phy"}]}
