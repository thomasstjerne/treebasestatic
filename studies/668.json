Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences based on maximum\nparsimony reveal two separate lineages of plants that produce mustard\noil glucosides. A major mustard-oil clade comprises the core capparalean\nfamilies of Brassicaceae, Capparaceae, Gyrostemonaceae, Resedaceae, and\nTovariaceae and includes Akaniaceae, Bataceae, Bretschneideraceae,\nCaricaceae, Koeberliniaceae, Limnanthaceae, Moringaceae,\nPentadiplandraceae, Salvadoraceae, and Tropaeolaceae. A second,\nunrelated lineage consists of the genus Drypetes, traditionally placed\nin Euphorbiaceae. The major mustard-oil clade recovered from the rbcL\nanalysis is congruent in many topological aspects with that found in a\nrecent cladistic study of morphological characters, and in turn the\nmolecular and morphological results confirm Dahlgren’s radically\nexpanded Capparales. An approach combining molecular and morphological\nevidence yields robust support for several lineages within this major\nmustard-oil clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mustard-oil families","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3664.phy"}]}
