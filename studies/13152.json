The specimen, NHMUK 28660, was\ndiscovered in a quarry near Cuckfield, West Sussex, from the same\nformation as the original teeth of Iguanodon anglicus. Fresh examination\nreveals that NHMUK 28660 exhibits a single autapomorphy (a row of\nforamina extending from the ventral surface of the symphysis onto the\nlateral surface of the dentary) and a unique combination of characters\nthat distinguish it from all other iguanodontian dentaries. In light of\nthis and because I. anglicus is regarded as a nomen dubium to which\nadditional material cannot be unambiguously referred, NHMUK 28660 is\nmade the holotype of the new genus and species Kukufeldia\ntilgatensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Ornithischia results","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithischia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55685.phy"}]}
