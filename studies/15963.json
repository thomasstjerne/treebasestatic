Monophyly of Mormodes is\nstrongly supported, as well as two main clades referred to as sections\nMormodes and Coryodes. There is a strong geographic component in the\nphylogeny, with more or less distinctive Mexican, Mesoamerican, Andean\nand Amazonian clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mormodes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97532.phy"}]}
