Here we described a fungus isolated from\nleafcutter ants (LCA). Morphologically, this fungus has spherical\nprimary conidia, and we described two types of microconidia: one with\nthe same shape as the primary conidia, and another with an elliptical to\nhalf-moon shape. It also produces villose conidia, as was only known\npreviously for Conidiobolus coronatus. A multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalysis was performed with the amplified sequences of three regions\n(nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA or nuc 28S rDNA; nuclear small\nsubunit ribosomal RNA or nuc 18S rDNA; and nuc rDNA ITS1‐5.8S‐ITS2 (ITS\nbarcode)), using a Basidiobolus strain as outgroup. Our isolates are\ndistinguished as a new species with a bootstrap support of 100% and are\nmore closely related to C. brefeldianus than to C. coronatus, despite\nits greater morphological resemblance with the latter. We describe a new\nspecies, C. lunula, based on morphological differences, its phylogenetic\ndistinctness from the previously described species, and its isolation\nfrom an altogether new host. This is the first finding of an\nentomophthoralean species isolated from LCA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124533.phy"}]}
