This study is focused on section\nCanescentia providing a phylogenetic re-evaluation based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer rDNA region (ITS), beta-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin\n(CaM) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2). Based on the\nphylogeny we show that five fynbos species are new and a number of\npreviously assigned synonyms of P. canescens and P. janczewskii should\nbe considered distinct species. We characterize fynbos strains based on\ntheir extrolite profiles, provide morphological descriptions for the new\nspecies, introduce the name P. elizabethi for the illegitimate P.\nechinatum, synonomize the recently described P. attenuatum, P. piltuense\nand P. ochotense with P. antarcticum, and update the accepted species\nlist for Penicillium section Canescentia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127871.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127864.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127873","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127873.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127865","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127865.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127878","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127878.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127872.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127870.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127863.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127862.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127867.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127866.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127868.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127869","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127869.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127874.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127875","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127875.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127876","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127876.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127877","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127877.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127879.phy"}]}
