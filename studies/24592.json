Phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic analysis based on ITS\nand LSU rDNA sequences showed that it is a new species in the genus\nArachnomyces, and the name Arachnomyces jinanicus was introduced. A.\npilosus and A. scleroticus are new combinations for Chrysosporium\npilosum and Onychocola sclerotica (=Malbranchia scleroticus)\nrespectively. Currently, 11 species are accepted in Arachnomyces and an\noverview with type information and reference sequence data is given. The\nphylogenetic relationships of species within the genus are discussed,\nand a dichotomous key for distinguishing all reported Arachnomyces\nspecies is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118632","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118632.phy"}]}
