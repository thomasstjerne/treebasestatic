We present a multigene analyses based on nuclear\nribosomal ITS and five plastid regions from 54 species representing all\nmajor taxonomic groups within Caladeniinae that provides a sound basis\nfor reinterpretation of Caladenia and allied genera. In our combined\nanalysis, apart from Leptoceras and Praecoxanthus, all Caladenia ingroup\ntaxa align in a strongly supported monophyletic group which is also\nsupported by morphological synapomorphies. Characters and character\nstates historically used to delimit taxa were revealed to be\nhomoplasious and therefore do not support recognition of Arachnorchis,\nCyanicula, Drakonorchis, Ericksonella, Jonesiopsis, Petalochilus,\nPheladenia and Stegostyla as previously proposed. Glossodia and\nElythranthera are shown to be a specialist group embedded within\nCaladenia. Based on our results, none of the current systems of\nclassification of the subtribe is satisfactory. Instead our results\npoint to Lindleys 1840 interpretation of Caladenia, but including\nGlossodia and Elythranthera, as being the most accurate reflection of\nthe group. Accordingly a renewed reclassification of Caladeniinae is\nproposed which necessitates the description of Caladenia subgen.\nParapentisia M.A.Clem. to accommodate Caladenia caerulea as well as\nseveral new combinations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74678","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74678.phy"}]}
