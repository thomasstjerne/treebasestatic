It has simple septa\nwith a pulley-wheel-shaped pore plug, which is diagnostic of\nphytoparasitic Urediniomycetidae members. The rupture of the outer\nhyphal cell wall layer at branching, a unique phenomenon noted in some\nsimple septate heterobasidiomycetes is observed and this seems to\ninvolve enzymatic degradation of the outer wall layer. The septal\nultrastructure of A. anacardiicola is similar to that in the genus\nSeptobasidium. The close relationship to Septobasidium is also confirmed\nby rDNA sequence analyses. The polyphyletic nature of the order\nPlatygloeales, noted in earlier studies, is evident from the present\nmolecular analysis as well. The placement of Auriculoscypha in the\nPlatygloeales can no longer be justified and both ultrastructural and\nmolecular evidence strongly support the placement of Auriculoscypha in\nthe Septobasidiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"arun MP","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculoscypha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2599.phy"}]}
