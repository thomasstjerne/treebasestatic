They are described in detail with supporting\nmorphological illustrations and compared with related taxa using\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis of ITS and 28S rDNA sequences. Xerocomus\ndoodhcha is characterized by a pale brown pileus, basidiospores with a\nfinely bacillate surface under SEM, and phylogenetic proximity to the\ntype species of Xerocomus, X. subtomentosus Hortiboletus indorubellus is\ncharacterized by a dark brown to reddish brown pileus, context that\nturns brownish to brownish orange on bruising, and phylogenetic\nproximity to Hortiboletus rubellus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"KD13082 ITS reduced","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100280.phy"},{"tree_label":"DC14002 ITS global","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100277.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S","ntax":"290","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xerocomoid boletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100275.phy"},{"tree_label":"DC14002 ITS reduced","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100276.phy"},{"tree_label":"KD13082 ITS global","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100281.phy"}]}
