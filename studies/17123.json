In order to develop mitochondrial\n(mt) genome data for this significant group, we sequenced the first\ncomplete mt genome of the sepsid fly Nemopoda mamaevi Ozerov, 1997. The\ncircular 15,878 bp mt genome is typical of Diptera, containing all 37\ngenes usually present in bilaterian animals. We discovered inaccurate\nannotations of fly mt genomes previously deposited on GenBank and thus\nre-annotated all published mt genomes of Cyclorrhapha. These\nre-annotations were based on comparative analysis of homologous genes,\nand provide a statistical analysis of start and stop codon positions. We\nfurther detected two 18 bp of conserved intergenic sequences between ND1\nand tRNASer(UCN) across Cyclorrhapha, which are the mtTERM binding site\nmotifs. Additionally, we compared automated annotation software MITOS\nwith hand annotation method. Phylogenetic trees based on the mt genome\ndata from Cyclorrhapha were inferred by Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian\nmethods, strongly supported a close relationship between Sepsidae and\nthe Tephritoidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85665.phy"}]}
