Alternative classifications for the Daltoniaceae have\nfavored traits from either sporophytes or gametophytes; phylogenetic\ntransitions in gametophytic leaf limbidia and sporophytic exostome\nornamentation were evaluated using ancestral state reconstruction to\nassess levels of conflict between these generations. Elimbate leaves and\ncross-striate exostome are reconstructed as plesiomorphic states.\nLimbate leaves and papillose exostomes evolved at least two and six\ntimes, respectively, without reversals. Evolution of leaf limbidia is\nrelatively conserved but exostome ornamentation is highly homoplasious,\nindicating that superficial similarity in peristomes gives unreliable\napproximations of phylogenetic relatedness. Our phylogenetic analyses\nshow that Achrophyllum and Calyptrochaeta are respectively monophyletic.\nWithin the core Daltoniaceae, relationships among taxa with elimbate\nleaves are generally well understood. However, taxa with limbate leaves\nform a monophyletic group, but resolved subclades correspond to\nbiogeographically entities, rather than to traditional concepts of\ngenera. Daltonia (~21 spp.), Distichophyllum (~100 spp.), and Leskeodon\n(~20 spp.) are polyphyletic. Seven nomenclatural changes are here\nproposed. Since the current taxonomy of Daltoniaceae lacks phylogenetic\nconsistency, critical generic revisions are needed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26506.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26510.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26514.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26503.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26504.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26505.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26507.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26508.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26509.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26511.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26512.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26513.phy"}]}
