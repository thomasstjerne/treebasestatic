In this revision of the tropical members of the genus,\n16 species are recognized, 14 assigned to the largely tropical sect.\nPaniculata (subg. Paniculata) and two to the largely temperate southern\nAfrican sect. Sophronia (subg. Lapeirousia). One new species, L.\nangolensis, is described and L. teretifolia is raised from subspecies to\nspecies rank. The center for tropical African Lapeirousia is northern\nNamibia, but species occur across south tropical Africa to Mozambique\nand north to Ethiopia, Sudan, and Nigeria. Lapeirousia is one of few\ngenera well represented in both tropical Africa and the winter-rainfall\nregion of temperate southern Africa, and it is unique in its wide\ndistribution in drier parts of Africa rather than the well.watered\neastern highland areas of the continent. Variation among the species is\nlargely floral, and flowers range from completely actinomorphic to\nmedianly zygomorphic and from short-tubed to extremely longtubed. An\nunusual degree of chromosomal variation occurs in sect. Paniculata with\nnumbers ranging from n = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, to 3 and karyotypes from\nstrongly bimodal to relatively uniform. Chromosome cytology correlates\nto some degree with patterns of morphological variation and provides\nindependent support for the phylogeny of the tropical species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lapeirousia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1599.phy"}]}
