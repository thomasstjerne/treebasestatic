A disease similar to gray mold on P. polyphylla occurred at\nthe seedling stage in March 2016 and 2017 in Tengchong city, Yunnan\nprovince of China. The disease resulted in up to 50% mortality in\nserious cases. Isolates from diseased plants grew 10.6 mm/d at 20⁰C on\nPDA. After 21 days, sclerotia were spherical to elliptical (0.42.5 ×\n0.31.8 mm). Conidia from diseased tissues were hyaline to pale brown,\nlong, ovoid, unicellular and measured 15.124.5 × 8.813.4 μm;\nconidiophores were 5261064 ×1215 μm. Isolates did not form conidiophores\nor conidia on PDA or MYA. A phylogenetic analysis based on G3PDH, RPB2\nand HSP60 sequence data supported assignment of three representative\nisolates as a new species of Botrytis. Based on morphological,\nphylogenetic characteristics and Koch’s Postulates, the causal agent of\ngray mold on P. polyphylla was identified as a novel species, Botrytis\npolyphyllae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"comb","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121615.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP60 MLT","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis HSP60","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121616.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 MLT","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121617.phy"},{"tree_label":"G3PDH MLT","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis G3PDH","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121618.phy"}]}
