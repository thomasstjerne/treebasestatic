It is characterized by yellow to brownish\ncolony, verticillate conidiophore and imbricate chains of fusiform\nconidia. Morphologically, the species is similar to M. elegans, M.\naquaticola and M samuelsii, but it is different from them in phylogeny\nand also differs with conida or phialides morphology and productivity\nand size of chlamydospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr66836","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66836.phy"}]}
