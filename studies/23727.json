This study uses\nphylogenetic analyses of gene sequences, zoospore ultrastructure, and\nthallus morphology and development to characterize a selection of\nstrains, which have been classified in this genus based on their\nmorphologies. Analyses of ribosomal genes place the isolates into three\nmajor lineages with 89% or greater boot-strap support. Rhizoclosmatium\nglobosum and R. aurantiacum, two of the four species described for this\ngenus, place into distinct lineages but are monophyletic. Based on\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses and thallus morphology of isolates,\nthree new species and one variety are added to the genus\nRhizoclosmatium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizoclosmatium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115281.phy"}]}
