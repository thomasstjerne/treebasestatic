Three species are restricted to afromontane\neastern Africa and three species are endemic to Australia. To\ninvestigate biogeographic and phylogenetic relationships within\nArctotidinae, sequence data from four cpDNA regions (psbA-trnH,\ntrnT-trnL and trnL-trnF spacers and trnL intron) and the ITS nrDNA\nregion for 60 Arctotidinae species were analyzed with parsimony and\nBayesian-inference approaches. Eight well-supported major clades were\nresolved. The earliest-diverging extant lineages are afromontane or\ninhabit mesic habitats, whereas almost all sampled taxa from the\nwinter-rainfall and semi-arid areas have diverged more recently.\nMolecular dating estimated that the major clades diverged during the\nMiocene and Pliocene, which is coincident with the trend of increasing\nrainfall seasonality, aridification and vegetation changes in\nsouthwestern Africa. Trans-oceanic dispersal to Australia was estimated\nto have occurred during the Pliocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctotidinae cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5214.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctotidinae total DNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5215.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctotidinae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5216.phy"}]}
