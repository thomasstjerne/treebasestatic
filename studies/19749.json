C. fetus has been divided into three\nsubspecies: C. fetus subsp. fetus (Cff), C. fetus subsp. venerealis\n(Cfv) and C. fetus subsp. testudinum (Cft). Subspecies identification of\nmammal-associated C. fetus strains is crucial in the control of Bovine\nGenital Campylobacteriosis (BGC), a syndrome associated with Cfv. The\nprescribed methods for subspecies identification of the Cff and Cfv\nisolates are: tolerance to 1% glycine and H2S production. Results: In\nthis study, we observed the deletion of a putative cysteine transporter\nin the Cfv strains, which are not able to produce H2S from L-cysteine.\nPhylogenetic reconstruction of the core genome single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) within Cff and Cfv strains divided these strains\ninto five different clades and showed that the Cfv clade and a Cff clade\nevolved from a single Cff ancestor. Conclusions: Multiple C. fetus\nclades were observed, which were not consistent with the biochemical\ndifferentiation of the strains. This suggests the need for a closer\nevaluation of the current C. fetus subspecies differentiation,\nconsidering that the phenotypic differentiation is still applied in BGC\ncontrol programs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campylobacter MLT of all isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98433.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campylobacter","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98434.phy"}]}
