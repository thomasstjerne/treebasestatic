Disposition\nto Incrucipulum was justified by molecular phylogenetic analysis based\non ITS-5.8S, LSU and RPB2 regions, and monophyly of Incrucipulum was\nalso confirmed. Some apomorphic characters of Incrucipulum were\nidentified. By addition of three new species, the genus Incrucipulum now\ncontains 13 species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ImportTree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Incrucipulum ITS LSU RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116925.phy"}]}
