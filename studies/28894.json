Leaf samples of\ncultivated and wild cucurbits species or subspecies showing symptoms and\nsigns of powdery mildew were collected from the north-western,\ncentral-western, and eastern regions of Mexico from November 2017\nthrough November 2020. Species associated with the disease were\nidentified by morphological features and sequences from the ITS\n(ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). All the specimens of powdery mildew presented only the\nanamorphic phase. Podosphaera xanthii was the predominant species since\nit was found in 85.7% of the samples analyzed in all three regions in\nMexico, and 13 out of 14 species or subspecies of cucurbits studied.\nNeoerysiphe sechii was found only in four species of cucurbits\nrepresenting 15.23% of the samples analyzed. These host species occurred\nin the central-western and eastern regions of the country. Golovinomyces\nambrosiae is documented for the first time on a Cucurbitaceae (Sicyos\ndeppei) from central-western Mexico. New hosts are also registered for\nN. sechii and P. xanthii in Mexico","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134685","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134685.phy"}]}
