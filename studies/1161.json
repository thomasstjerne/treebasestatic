Two main paralogous copies of 5S-NTS were found for Brassaiopsis\nbut both were not recovered for all species. All but one species of\nBrassaiopsis was represented by 5S-NTS (copy 1). Separate parsimony\nanalyses of ITS and 5S-NTS (copy 1) generated mainly congruent\ntopologies, but several non-monophyletic sequences in the 5S-NTS tree\nprecluded data combination. A sister relationship of Brassaiopsis with\nTrevesia was strongly inferred, as was the monophyly of Brassaiopsis.\nThe divergence of Brassaiopsis from Trevesia was estimated using a\nlikelihood method to have occurred ca. 20 million years ago (MYA) during\na period of mountain building and climatic change in SE Asia. Resolution\nof relationships was poor among monophyletic groups within Brassaiopsis\nand the divergence among species was inferred to have occurred\nrelatively recently at ca. 8 MYA. However, several clades within the\ngenus were circumscribed based on ITS and 5S-NTS analyses, i.e., 1) B.\naculeata, B. glomerulata, and B. hainla; 2) B. grushvitzkyi, B.\nmoumingensis, B. phanrangensis, and B. stellata; 3) B. ciliata and B.\nhispida; 4) B. fatsioides and B. palmipes; and 5) B. gracilis and B.\ntripteris. Brassaiopsis producta was clearly isolated in both analyses.\nMorphological characters previously considered important for defining\nspecies and subgeneric groups were shown to have had multiple origins\n(e.g., leaf architecture and locular number in the ovary). The\nBrassaiopsis phylogeny supports strong biogeographic connections of\nSouth China and Indochina, South China and southwestern China, and\nsouthwestern China and the eastern Himalayas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"5S","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassaiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1795.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS big","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassaiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1796.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS small","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassaiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1797.phy"}]}
