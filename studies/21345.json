The physico-chemical characteristics of the\nherbivore dung combined with the level of fungal adaptation to different\nsubstrates offer the perfect setting for discovering new taxa. This\nstudy focused on the identification of Eurotialean ascomycetes isolated\nfrom 130 dung samples collected in different Spanish localities. A total\nof 165 isolates of Eurotialean fungi (i.e. 60 Aspergillus and 105\npenicillium-like) were studied. The isolates were preliminary identified\nby morphology and sequencing of β-tubulin (BenA) gene. New taxa were\ncharacterized by multi-gene sequence analysis using BenA, the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), calmodulin (CaM), and RNA polymerase II second\nlargest subunit (RPB2) genes, and a detailed morphologic study. Using\nthis polyphasic approach and following the genealogical concordance\nphylogenetic species recognition concept (GCPSR), we proposed two new\ngenera Pseudopenicillium and Penicillago in family Aspergillaceae, and\n23 new species, including ten Aspergillus, six Penicillium and four\nTalaromyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Aspergillus BenA general tree","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105904.phy"},{"tree_label":"Usti concatenated tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105909.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cremei concatenated tree","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105906.phy"},{"tree_label":"Flavipedes concatenated tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105907.phy"},{"tree_label":"Terrei concatenated tree","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105908.phy"},{"tree_label":"Candidi concatenated tree","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105905","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105905.phy"}]}
