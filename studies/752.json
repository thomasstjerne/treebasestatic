Recently, a\nHelicosporidium sp., isolated from the blackfly Simulium jonesi Stone\n& Snoddy (Diptera: Simuliidae), has been amplified in the\nheterologous host Helicoverpa zea. Genomic DNA has been extracted from\ngradient purified cysts. The 18S, 28S, 5.8S regions of the\nHelicosporidium ribosomal DNA, as well as partial sequences of the actin\nand b-tubulin genes, were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Comparative\nanalysis of these nucleotide sequences was performed using\nNeighbor-Joining and Maximum-Parsimony methods. All inferred\nphylogenetic trees placed Helicosporidium sp. among green algae\n(Chlorophyta), and this association was supported by bootstrap and\nparsimony jackknife values. Phylogenetic analysis focused on green algae\ndepicted Helicosporidium sp. as a close relative of Prototheca\nwickerhamii and P. zopfii (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae), two\nachlorophylous, pathogenic green algae. On the basis of this\nphylogenetic analysis, Helicosporidium sp. is clearly neither a protist\nnor a fungus, but appears to be the first described algal invertebrate\npathogen. These conclusions lead us to propose the transfer of the genus\nHelicosporidium to Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"tubulin algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SSU algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"actin algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SSU algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5586.phy"}]}
