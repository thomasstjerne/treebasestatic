In this study a large\ncollection of Diplodia strains, obtained from ash and other woody hosts\nshowing V-shaped cankers and branch dieback, were identified based on\nmorphological characters and DNA sequence data from ITS and EF1-Î± loci.\nResults of combined morphological and phylogenetic analyses showed that\nthe Fraxinus isolates from Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain\nbelong to three distinct species namely Diplodia fraxini, Diplodia\nmutila and Diplodia subglobosa sp. nov. An epitype was designated for\nDiplodia mutila, with associated ex-epitype cultures. The name D.\nfraxini is re-instated and a neotype designated. Two species, Diplodia\nseriata and Diplodia pseudoseriata were reported for the first time on\nFraxinus spp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia Maximum
