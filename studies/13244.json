Reexamination of\nthe original and study of newly collected material indicate that\nTuranoceratops has well-developed supraorbital horns and apparently\nlacks a nasal horn. Turanoceratops is more derived than the more or less\ncoeval Zuniceratops from the Moreno Hill Formation of New Mexico in the\npresence of double-rooted teeth and of two or three teeth in each\nvertical dental file.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56004.phy"}]}
