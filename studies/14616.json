The general absence of genomic resources available for this\nimportant group of plants, however, has resulted in the strong\ndependence of these studies on plastid data; nuclear or mitochondrial\ndata have been rarely used. In this study, we utilize novel\ntranscriptome data to design primers for nuclear markers for use in\nstudies of fern evolutionary biology, and demonstrate the utility of\nthese markers across the largest order of ferns, the Polypodiales. We\npresent 20 novel single-copy nuclear regions, across 10 distinct\nprotein-coding genes: ApPEFP_C, cryptochrome 2, cryptochrome 4, DET1,\ngapCpSh, IBR3, pgiC, SQD1, TPLATE, and transducin. These loci, both\nindividually and in combination, show strong resolving power across the\nPolypodiales phylogeny, and are readily amplified and sequenced from our\ngenomic DNA test set (from 15 diploid Polypodiales species). For each\nregion, we also present transcriptome alignments of the focal locus and\nrelated paralogscurated broadly across fernsthat will allow researchers\nto develop their own primer sets for fern taxa outside of the\nPolypodiales. Analyses of sequence data generated from our genomic DNA\ntest set reveal strong effects of partitioning schemes on support levels\nand, to a much lesser extent, on topology. A model partitioned by codon\nposition is strongly favored, and analyses of the combined data yield a\nPolypodiales phylogeny that is well supported and consistent with\nearlier studies of this group. The 20 novel single-copy regions\npresented here more than triple the single-copy nuclear regions\navailable for use in fern phylogenetic inference. They provide a much\nneeded opportunity to assess previous plastid-derived hypotheses of\nrelationships within the ferns, and increase our capacity to explore\nmany aspects of fern evolution previously unavailable to scientific\ninvestigation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2+","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ApPEFP allin phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65943.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRYtree_rep8","ntax":"331","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CRY allin phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65946.phy"},{"tree_label":"DET1_best_REP9","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"DET1 allin phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65947.phy"},{"tree_label":"gapbest_REP1+","ntax":"212","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"gap allin phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66032.phy"},{"tree_label":"IBR3_REP10+","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"IBR3 allin ML phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66035.phy"},{"tree_label":"pgiC_bestREP5+","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"pgiC allin ML phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66036.phy"},{"tree_label":"SQD1 bestREP9","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SQD1 allin ML phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66050.phy"},{"tree_label":"TPLATE bestREP5","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TPLATE allin ML phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66051.phy"},{"tree_label":"transducin bestREP5","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"transducin allin ML phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66052.phy"}]}
