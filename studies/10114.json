We\nevaluated this with a sequence alignment of 1336 protist and heterokont\nalgae SSU rRNAs, which includes 673 diatoms. Sequences were aligned to\nmaintain structural elements conserved within this dataset. Parsimony\nanalysis rejected the CMB hypothesis, albeit weakly. Morphological data\nare also incongruent with this recent CMB hypothesis of three diatom\nclades. We also re-analysed a recently published dataset that purports\nto support the CMB hypothesis. Our re-analysis found that the original\nanalysis had not converged on the true bipartition posterior probability\ndistribution, and rejected the CMB hypothesis. Thus we conclude that a\nreclassification of the evolutionary relationships of the diatoms\naccording to the CMB hypothesis is premature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"diatom clade b","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6666.phy"},{"tree_label":"diatom clade a","ntax":"346","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6665.phy"},{"tree_label":"diatom clade d","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6663.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6664.phy"},{"tree_label":"diatom clade c","ntax":"264","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6667.phy"}]}
