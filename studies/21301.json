The genus includes species growing on bark or wood which have\nbeen described from boreal to temperate regions of the Northern\nHemisphere. Cheiromycina is characterized by a non-corticated thallus\ncontaining chlorococcoid photobionts, nearly immersed in the bark or\nwood and presenting powdery unpigmented sporodochia. In the type species\nC. flabelliformis, in C. petri and in C. reimeri the multicellular\nconidia are peculiarly cheiroid, dichotomously branched. Here we\nexplored the phylogenetic placement of Cheiromycina as its relationships\nwith other fungi were still unknown. The three mentioned species coming\nfrom different localities were successfully sequenced for three loci\n(nuSSU, nuLSU and mtSSU). The genus Cheiromycina is found within\nLecanorales in the family Malmideaceae forming a monophyletic clade\nsister to the genera Savoronala and Malmidea; this phylogenetic\nplacement and the relationships of Cheiromycina with other lichenized\nhyphomycetous taxa is here discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105750.phy"}]}
