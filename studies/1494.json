Now, a re-examination of the type\nmaterial of Queirozia and of other two specimens showed that Queirozia\nturbinata has a very distinct combination of characters which do not\nallow its placement within Pleochaeta. It has forked special aerial\nhyphae, subclavate and predominantly lemon-shaped conidia,and both\nconidiophores and conidia varying from grayish to yellowish-brown (a\nfeature that appears to be unique for this fungus within the\nErysiphales). This may represent the first dematiaceous anamorphic\npowdery midew known to science. This fungus also has hemiendophytic\nmycelium, a character considered almost exclusive to the tribe\nPhyllactinieae. The outer wall surface pattern of wrinkled and turgid\nconidia of Q. turbinata as observed under the SEM is different from\nthose presented in the literature for this tribe. Molecular analysis\nshowed that Q. turbinata belongs to the tribe Phyllactinieae and is\nphylogenetic closer to Pleochaeta than to Leveillula or Phyllactinia. It\nis therefore acknowledged that Queirozia is closely related to Pleocheta\nbut too distinct morphologically from this genus to be accepted as a\nsynonym. Emended descriptions of Queirozia and Q. turbinata are\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_916.phy"}]}
