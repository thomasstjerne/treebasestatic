For representative isolates, the region\nspanning the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA,\nthe nuclear gene encoding heat shock protein 90 and the mitochondrial\ncox1 gene were PCR amplified and sequenced. Based on phylogenetic\nanalysis and morphological and physiological comparison, four species\nand one informally designated taxon have been described; Phytophthora\ngibbosa, P. gregata, P. litoralis, P. thermophila and P. taxon paludosa.\nPhytophthora gibbosa, P. gregata and P. taxon paludosa form a new\ncluster and share a common ancestor; they are homothallic and generally\nassociated with dying vegetation in swampy or water-logged areas.\nPhytophthora thermophila and P. litoralis are sister species to each\nother and more distantly to P. gonapodyides. Both new species are common\nin waterways and cause scattered mortality within native vegetation.\nThey are self-sterile and appear well adapted for survival in an aquatic\nenvironment and inundated soils, filling the niche occupied by P.\ngonapodyides and P. taxon salixsoil in the northern hemisphere.\nCurrently the origin of these new taxa, their pathogenicity and their\nrole in natural ecosystems are unknown. Following the precautionary\nprinciple, they should be regarded as a potential threat to native\necosystems and managed to minimise their further spread","trees":[{"tree_label":"COX1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31178.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP BS","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31182.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP BAYES","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31183.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX1 BAYES","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31180.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31181.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31184.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX1 BS","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31179","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31179.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BS","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31185.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BAYES","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31186","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31186.phy"}]}
