The new species is\nmorphologically very similar to C. dulciolens but is distinguished from\nthat species by having vivid mauve-violet lamellae when young, reduced\nverrucose spore ornamentation, a less pronounced plage, and the presence\nof abundant clamp connections in the epicuticular hyphae. A molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and RNA\npolymerase second largest subunit (RPB2) found that C. atropileatus is\nsister to an undescribed sequestrate species, and nested in the section\nDulciolentes with C. dulciolens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius atropileatus ITS-rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114135.phy"}]}
