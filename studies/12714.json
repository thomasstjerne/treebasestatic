Microidium phyllanthi-reticulati [= Oidium\nphyllanthi var. reticulati] is characterized by having amphigenous\ncolonies on the host surface, long foot-cells of conidiophore twisted at\nthe base, barrel-shaped to cylindrical conidia with Microidium type germ\ntubes. The new species differs from the allied and morphologically very\nsimilar M. phyllanthi in having smaller conidia and conidiophores with\nlonger foot-cells. Analyses of rDNA ITS sequence data support the\nseparation of M. phyllanthi-reticulati from M. phyllanthi. The new\nspecies is described in detail, illustrated and discussed in the context\nof other species assigned to Microidium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microidium on Phyllanthus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108571.phy"}]}
