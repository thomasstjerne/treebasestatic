All species in the two genera are\nperennial herbs with large taproots and chromosome base numbers of x =\n19. The species of Balsamorhiza have exclusively basal leaves while the\nspecies of Wyethia have cauline leaves (in addition to basal leaves in\nsome species). The relationships among the species of Balsamorhiza and\nWyethia were examined using sequences from the nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacer and external transcribed spacer regions and the\nchloroplast 3\u001a trnK intron. Twenty-three species of Balsamorhiza and\nWyethia and eight outgroups were sampled. The analyses support the\nmonophyly of the Balsamorhiza/Wyethia clade. Wyethia ovata, a species\nfrom southern California and northern Baja California, is sister to the\nother members of the Balsamorhiza/Wyethia clade. Balsamorhiza is\nstrongly supported as monophyletic and is the sister to the rest of\nWyethia. The mostly Californian Wyethia section Agnorhiza, which lacks\nbasal leaves, is not monophyletic. The remainder of the Wyethia species,\ntraditionally placed in sections Alarconia and Wyethia, form a clade in\nthe molecular trees and share synapomorphic large basal leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsamorhiza and Wyethia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_963.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsamorhiza and Wyethia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_962.phy"}]}
