Australasian Grey Teal (Anas gracilis) and\nChestnut Teal (A. castanea) are widely viewed as specifically distinct,\nbut the taxonomy of the New Zealand teals remains unsettled. Because\nconservation status is affected by taxonomic rank, it is important to\nresolve the status of the rare subantarctic teals. To estimate\nphylogenetic relationships of teals, we sequenced three mitochondrial\nDNA genes (12S, and ATPase 6 and 8). The resultant phylogeny\nunequivocally groups the Chestnut Teal with the Grey Teal, rather than\nwith the New Zealand teals as has traditionally been held (Fleming\n1953). A greater level of sequence divergence occurred within the New\nZealand teals than between the Grey and Chestnut teals. This diversity\ntogether with morphological and behavioral differences, implies that the\nNew Zealand teals should be accorded specific status as A. aucklandica,\nA. nesiotis, and A. chlorotis. Although it is most likely that the teal\nthat colonized the Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands originated in\nNew Zealand, our data do not allow us to determine whether the ancestors\nof the Campbell Island Teal came from mainland New Zealand or the\nAuckland Islands. This uncertainty arises because, as our data show, the\ncolonization events were separated by a short period of time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australasian Teals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3788.phy"}]}
