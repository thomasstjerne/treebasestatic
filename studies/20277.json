All Deparia species\nformed a highly supported monophyletic group. Within Deparia, seven\nmajor clades were identified, and most of them were characterized by\ninferring synapomorphies using 14 morphological characters including\nleaf architecture, petiole base, rhizome type, soral characters, spore\nperine, and leaf indument. These results provided the morphological\nbasis for an infra-generic taxonomic revision of Deparia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deparia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107532.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep9BEST","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deparia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107533.phy"}]}
