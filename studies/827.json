The genus is characterised by spores with a\nstrongly cavernous type of ornamentation due to cavernae in the\nepitunica (perispor), and the possession of cheilo-, pleuro- and\ncaulocystidia. It seems to be associated with Hopea species\n(Dipterocarpaceae). Molecular data suggest a close relationship to\nHebeloma and Naucoria, but indicate that it represents an independent\nline of evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anamika LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3964.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anamika ITS and LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3965.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anamika ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_611.phy"}]}
