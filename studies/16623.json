Morphologically the new taxon is similar to C. zonata and C.\ncorvina, but the pale gray to reddish brown floccose squamules on the\npileus and molecular data based on ribosomal DNA ITS sequence make it a\ndistinct species. The holotype is deposited in the Fungal Herbarium of\nGuangdong Institute of Microbiology (GDGM) and the sequence data is\ndeposited in GenBank.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79389.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79392.phy"}]}
