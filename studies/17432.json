Phylogenetic relationships are\nestimated using sequence data from five plastid loci (rpoC1, matK gene\nand flanking trnK intron, atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer, and the 3Â’ portion\nof ycf1) plus the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed\nspacers (ITS, ETS), and a portion of the low-copy nuclear gene phyC.\nPhylogenetic analyses confirm the monophyly of Mormolyca and clarify\nrelationships within the genus: an early divergent paraphyletic grade of\nspecies diverging from the line leading to a major clade of two\ndistinctive subclades. The three new species are contained within these\nsubclades: M. dodsonii and M. cruentata clustering with the subclade\ncharacterize by flowers with a labellum pad of short glandular papillae;\nwhereas M. prunina groups with the clade that includes all species with\nglossy labella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mormolyca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86823.phy"}]}
