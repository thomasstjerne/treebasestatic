Although the taxonomy of Sympoventuriaceae has been well\nstudied, generic boundaries within the family remain poorly resolved due\nto the lack of type materials and molecular data. To address this issue\nand establish a more stable and reliable classification system in\nSympoventuriaceae, we performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using\nsequence data of seven genes (SSU, ITS, LSU, act1, tub2, tef1 and rpb2)\nwith increased taxon sampling and morphological analysis. The molecular\ndata combined with detailed morphological studies of 143 taxa resolved\n22 genera within the family, including one new genus, eight new species,\nsix new combinations, and new sexual-asexual connections. Finally, we\nfurther investigated the evolutionary history of Sympoventuriaceae by\nreconstructing patterns of lifestyle diversification, indicating the\nancestral state to be saprophytic, with transitions to endophytic, plant\nand animal/human pathogens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135055.phy"}]}
