WGS-based methods may be particularly useful in areas\nwith less diverse Mycobacterium tuberculosis populations, such as New\nYork City, where conventional genotyping is often uninformative and\nfield epidemiology often difficult. This study applies four candidate\nstrategies for WGS-based identification of emerging M. tuberculosis\nsubpopulations, employing both phylogenomic and population genetics\nmethods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101533.phy"}]}
