Combined molecular and morphological\nanalyses revealed that all these specimens belong to Erysiphe\nquercicola. These powdery mildews are nested within the E. quercicola\nclade. This research shows that while sexual morph of Erysiphe\nquercicola is only found on oak species (Quercus, Fagaceae), its asexul\nmorph has a broad host range, particularly in the tropics. Cassia\nfistula, C. argyrophylla, J. curcas, K. calycina, H. macrocarpa, M.\nphilippinensis, M. pudica, T. indica and Z. jujube are new host records\nfor E. quercicola worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118637","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118637.phy"}]}
