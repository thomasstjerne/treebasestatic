Some species decay culms of woody\nbamboos, a poorly known biotic interaction. Four bambusicolous species\nof Fomitiporia are currently known. However, no studies concerning their\nphylogenetic relationships have been performed. In order to assess\nspecies boundaries and their relationships to each other, we conducted\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses of nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer\nregion ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) and portions of nuc 28S rDNA (28S), RNA\npolymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and translation elongation\nfactor 1-Î± (TEF1), as well as morphological analyses. Four species that\noccur on culms of woody bamboos, F. bambusarum, F. spinescens, F.\nuncinata, and the new species F. bambusipileata, grouped together in an\nexclusive clade within a primarily Neotropical lineage. The new species\ndiffers from all other species in the group by the pileate basidiomata.\nHypotheses regarding host-exclusivity are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule++","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128286.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1++","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128287.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128288.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128289.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1++","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128290.phy"}]}
