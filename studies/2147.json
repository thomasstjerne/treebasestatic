(tribe\nAcacieae) and to further knowledge of the phylogeny of the related tribe\nIngeae, we have sequenced two regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS and\nETS). Sixty species from the tribe Ingeae (26 genera), together with\nrepresentatives from each of five lineages of tribe Acacieae, have been\nsampled. Ingeae and Acacia s.s. form a well supported clade, with a\nmonophyletic Acacia s.s. nested within a paraphyletic Ingeae. Based on\nlimited sampling, the closest relative of Acacia s.s. is most likely one\nof the Australian species of the genus Paraserianthes: Paras. lophantha\nsubsp. lophantha or Paras. toona. Related to Acacia s.s. and\nParaserianthes is a group of Ingeae taxa from Australia and South East\nAsia: Archidendron p.p., Archidendropsis, Pararchidendron and\nWallaceodendron. This study is a preliminary step in resolving the\ninter-generic relationships of the tribe Ingeae. Genetic relationships\nwithin the Ingeae appear to conform to morphological groups previously\nidentified as genera and informal alliances; some notable exceptions are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ingeae and Acacia s.s., ETS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_374.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ingeae and Acacia s.s., ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3096.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ingeae and Acacia s.s., ITS and ETS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3097.phy"}]}
