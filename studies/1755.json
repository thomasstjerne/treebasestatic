Plastid phylogeny is\nrelatively well investigated, but molecular phylogenies have conflicted\nas a function of gene choice, taxon-representations, and analytical\nmethod. To better understand the influences of these variables, we\nperformed analyses of a multi-gene data set based on 62\nplastid-associated genes of 15 taxa representing the major plastid\nlineages. In an attempt to distinguish phylogenetic signal from\nnon-phylogenetic patterns, we analyzed the data using a wide range of\nphylogenetic methods and examined the effect of covarion evolution and\ncompositional bias. The data suggest that the chlorophyll c-containing\nplastids are monophyletic and acquired their plastids from the red algae\nafter the emergence of the Cyanidiales. The relationships among chl\nc-containing plastids are particularly hard to resolve. This is the\nlargest data set used for this purpose; the analyses show that\ncryptophyte plastids are sister to other chl c-containing plastids, and\nhaptophyte and peridinin-containing dinoflagellate plastids are closely\nrelated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"15 genes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyll-c containing plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4781.phy"},{"tree_label":"p-a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyll-c containing plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4782.phy"},{"tree_label":"24 genes","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyll-c containing plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4783.phy"},{"tree_label":"38-genes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyll-c containing plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4784.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyll-c containing plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4785.phy"}]}
