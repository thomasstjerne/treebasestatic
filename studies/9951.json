A phylogenetic analysis of the Paniceae based on chloroplast\nsequence data (ndhF) was performed with special emphasis on section\nStolonifera of Panicum. Fourteen sequences of species of sect.\nStolonifera and Echinolaena were added to a panicoid grass matrix\npreviously published giving a total of 140 sequences. As a result,\nOcellochloa is here described as a new genus including 12 new\ncombinations: O. andreana, O. biglandularis, O. brachystachya, O.\nchapadensis, O. craterifera, O. irregularis, O. latissima, O.\npiauiensis, O. pulchella, O. rudis, O. soderstromii, and O. stolonifera.\nThe position of Panicum venezuelae, previously placed in section\nStolonifera of Panicum with the above mentioned species, clearly\nindicates that this species is not closely related to the Ocellochloa\nclade. This conclusion is supported by several morphological characters,\nsuch as the presence of axillary inflorescences, cleistogamous spikelets\nand glands of the upper lemma depressed, not crateriform. Ocellochloa\ndiffers from Panicum s.s. by the unilateral spikelet disposition, the\nsmooth surface of the upper anthecium, and a C3 photosynthetic pathway.\nThis new genus is described and compared with other allied genera of the\nPaniceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"140","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ocellochloa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6076.phy"}]}
