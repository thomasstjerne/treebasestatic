An 8 domain hybrid\nPKS/NRPS greater than 8 thousand bases was identified in 19 deeply\nsequenced dinoflagellate transcriptomes. The gene was found in data from\nOxyrrhis marina and 18 core dinoflagellates, but not the syndinean genus\nAmoebophrya. Spliced leaders, introns, and multiple subtle sequence\nvariants were found, ruling out bacterial contaminants and confirming\nthe dinoflagellate source of the sequences. However, the domain content\nand order are shared with a bacterial cryptic noncanonical PKS/NRPS\n(BurA) from Burkholderia spp., indicating a likely bacterial origin\nthrough horizontal gene transfer. The dinoflagellate and bacterial genes\nalso have similar amino acid and malonyl CoA binding pockets. Based on\nlabeling studies from Burkholderia spp. the dinoflagellates may use\nmethionine to produce a propionate for incorporation into natural\nproducts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates BurA-like MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87126.phy"}]}
