Based on morphology and multigene phylog-\nenies, section Citrina species were identified as P. cairnsense, P.\ncitrinum, P. pancosmium, P. pasqualense, P. sanguifluum, P. sizovae, P.\nsumatrense and P. ubiquetum. One of the species displayed unique\nphenotypic characters and DNA sequences and is described here as P.\nsucrivorum. Multigene phyloge- nies consistently resolved the new\nspecies in a clade with P. aurantiacobrunneum, P. cairnsense, P. mic-\nzynksii, P. neomiczynskii and P. quebecense. However, ITS, b-tubulin and\ncalmodulin gene sequences are unique for P. sucrivorum and growth rates\non various media, the ability to grow at 30 C, a positive Ehrlich\nreaction and the absence of sclerotia on all media examined, distinguish\nP. sucrivorum from all of its close relatives.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Citrina ML ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77798.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Citrina Combined Citrina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77799.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77800.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Citrina CMD Citrina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77797.phy"}]}
