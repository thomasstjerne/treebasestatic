Here, we have investigated the phylogenetic and\nphylogeographic patterns and genetic diversities of species of the\nendemic genus Romecytheridea from the Southern and Central part of Lake\nTanganyika. We found that ostracod populations from four different\nlocalities are genetically highly differentiated from each other when\nanalyzing the mitochondrial 16S region, while they are almost identical\nwith genetic markers from the nuclear genome (D1-D2 from the large\nribosomal subunit (LSU) and ITS). The criteria of the K/θ method for the\nevolutionary species concepts are fulfilled when analysing 16S DNA\nsequence data, indicating that these populations are in fact different\n(cryptic) species with allopatric distribution. We discuss various\nhypotheses on how this high diversity could have originated. The\ncomplete lineage segregation can partly be explained by geographic\nisolation during periods of low lake level stands. But also other\nfactors must have contributed to genetic isolation and speciation, as\nalso the two closest populations (Chimba and Katoto) from shallow parts\nof the Southern basin of Tanganyika are geographically fully\nsegregated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Romecytheridea_ampla_bacta_Lake Tanganyika _16S","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63741.phy"}]}
