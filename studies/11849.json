Fairy-wrens of the genus\nMalurus are known for high intensities of sexual selection, resulting in\nsome cases in rapid speciation. This history suggests that incomplete\nlineage sorting (ILS) of neutrally evolving loci could be substantial, a\nsituation that could compromise traditional methods of combining loci in\nphylogenetic analysis. Using eighteen molecular markers (5 anonymous\nloci, 7 exons, 5 introns and one mtDNA locus), we show that gene tree\nmonophyly across species could be rejected for 16 out of 18 loci,\nsuggesting substantial ILS at the family level in these birds. Using the\nsoftware Concaterpillar, we also detect three statistically distinct\nclusters of gene trees among the 18 loci. Despite substantial variation\nin gene trees, species trees constructed using four different species\ntree estimation methods (BEST, BUCKy, and STAR) were generally\nwell-supported and similar to each other and to the concatenation tree,\nwith a few mild discordances at nodes that could explained by rapid and\nrecent speciation events. By contrast, minimizing deep coalescences\n(MDC) produced a species tree that was topologically more divergent from\nthose of the other methods as measured by multidimensional scaling of\ntrees. Additionally, gene and species trees were topologically more\nsimilar in the BEST analysis, presumably because of the species tree\nprior employed in BEST which appropriately assumes that gene trees are\ncorrelated with each other and with the species tree. Among the 18 loci\nwe also discovered 102 independent indel markers, which also proved\nphylogenetically informative, primarily among genera, and displayed a\n~4-fold bias towards deletions. As suggested in earlier work, the\ngrasswrens (Amytornis) are sister to the rest of the family, and the\nemu-wrens (Stipiturus) are sister to fairy-wrens (Malurus, Clytomias).\nOur study shows that ILS is common at the family level in birds yet,\ndespite this, species tree methods converge on broadly similar results\nfor this family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Full gene tree
