It is characterized by having a subglobose corm,\na spike-like (racemose) inflorescence, never fully opened and spurless\nflowers, a collar-shaped stigma and subglobose capsules. Based on DNA\nsequence data from three gene regions (nuclear ribosomal ITS, two\nchloroplast matK and trnL), we investigated its phylogenetic position\nwithin the tribe Arethuseae. Phylogenies using Maximum Likelihood and\nBayesian Inference support the recognition of Thuniopsis as a distinct\ngenus, and suggest its close relationship to the genera Bletilla,\nDilochia, and Thunia. The new genus is circumscribed and a description\nand illustrations of the new species are provided. The phylogenetic\nrelationships among the genera in Arethuseae are accessed. Moreover, our\nphylogeny also shed light on the phylogenetic positions of several\ngenera which, to date, remain uncertain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thuniopsis ITS matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89139.phy"}]}
