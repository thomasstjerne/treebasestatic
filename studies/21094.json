Surveys conducted in eastern USA revealed\nseveral Geosmithia isolates from subcortical beetle species had not been\ncharacterized previously. Geosmithia isolates recovered from several\nassayed bark beetles exhibited brownish-colored colonies, a\ncharacteristic feature of species in G. pallida species complex (GPSC).\nMolecular studies based on multiple loci (ITS, TEF-1Î±, Tub2, and RPB2)\nresolved their phylogenetic placement within the GPSC. Two new\nGeosmithia species, G. brunnea and G. proliferans, were here described\nwith morphological illustrations and molecular phylogeny presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geosmithia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105118.phy"}]}
