H.sinensis is characterized by\nsmall basidiomata, pileus strongly sulcate when young, ellipsoidal to\nlong ellipsoidal spores, germ pore absent, cheilocystidia present and\npleurocystidia absent. Phylogenetic analyses of three-gene (ITS, LSU and\ntef-1α) show that H.sinensis forms a distinct lineage and group together\nwith H.floriformis in the Hausknechtia by Maximum Likelihood and\nBayesian methods. Due to characteristics of H.sinensis conflict with\nWächter & Melzers description of Hausknechtia, the description of\nHausknechtia was emended. The detailed description, color photos,\nillustrations in the paper are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134922.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134923.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134926","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134926.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134927","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134927.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134930","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134930.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134931","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134931.phy"}]}
