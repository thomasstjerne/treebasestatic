In this study,\n52 Diaporthe strains were isolated from 27 infected bud samples of peach\ntrees from Fujian Province, China, showing constriction canker symptoms\nin Fujian Province, China. Phylogenetic analyses based on five loci,\nincluding internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (ITS),\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (TEF), ß-tubulin (TUB), histone (HIS),\nand calmodulin (CAL) gene regions, coupled with morphology revealed\nseven species associated with the disease, including five known species\n(D. caryae, D. cercidis, D. eres, D. hongkongensis, and D. unshiuensis).\nIn this study, two novel species (D. jinxiu and D. zaofenghuang) as\nreferring to the host varieties are also introduced. This study\nrepresents the first characterization of these Diaporthe species related\nto the peach constriction canker in China, contributes useful data for\npracticable disease management.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe peach constriction canker","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133735.phy"}]}
