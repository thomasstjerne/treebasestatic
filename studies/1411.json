{"Authors":" Robert S. Wallace, Charles A. Butterworth","Year":" 2005","Title":" Molecular phylogenetics of the leafy cactus genus Pereskia\n(Cactaceae)","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Members of Pereskia exhibit some presumably plesiomorphic\ncharacters for the Cactaceae including shrubby habit, non-succulent or\npartially succulent leaves, and in some species, nearly superior\novaries. In addition, the members show a transition from perigynous\nflowers with half-inferior ovaries to those species having true\nreceptacular epigyny (the predominant condition in the Cactaceae). To\nexamine interspecific relationships within Pereskia we utilized cpDNA\nrestriction-site data and sequences from two non-coding regions of the\nplastid genome - the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer and the rpl16 intron.\nMaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses identified three major\nclades: a clade containing the widespread P. aculeata and the Andean\nspecies, a clade containing five species found primarily in eastern\nBrazil, and a third clade centered in southern Central America and the\nCaribbean. The relationship between these three clades and the rest of\nthe Cactaceae remains unresolved, but our data do suggest that Pereskia\nmay be paraphyletic. The sister taxon relationship for the yellow\nflowered species of Pereskia (P. aureiflora, P. guamacho ) was also\nconfirmed, despite their widely disjunct distribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pereskia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2242.phy"}]}
