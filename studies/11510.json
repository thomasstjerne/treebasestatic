Based on an nrITS maximum likelihood phylogeny we identify\naccessions belonging to either the Syzygiella concreta or the S.\nperfoliata lineage. We use these DNA vouchers to recircumscribe both\nspecies and present morphological characters that allow for their\nidentification. Differences have been seen in the development of the\nstem cortex, the insertion of the leaves, presence or absence of\nrudimentary amphigastria, size and shape of the leaf cell wall trigones,\nand papillosity of the leaf cuticle.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adelanthaceae_Jamesonielloideae_ITS_Maximum_Likelihood","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46087.phy"}]}
