Analyses of these data provide support for the monophyly of the\nliverworts, and for previously resolved backbone relationships within\nthe Marchantiophyta. The earliest divergence involves the \u001asimple\nthalloid\u001a taxa of the Haplomitriaceae and Treubiaceae. A\nBlasiaceae/complex thalloid clade is resolved as sister to all remaining\nliverworts. The leafy liverworts do not resolve as monophyletic. The\nseparation of the Aneuraceae/Metzgeriaceae from all other simple\nthalloids and their placement within the \u001a leafy\u001a clade as sister to the\nenigmatic leafy genus Pleurozia, as suggested in earlier molecular\nphylogenies, is also supported by this far larger data set.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marchantiophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4615.phy"}]}
