During our investigation of forest\npathogens, we made collections of Diaporthe species associated with\ncanker and dieback disease of Betula platyphylla and B. albosinensis in\nSichuan and Shaanxi provinces inChina. Diaporthe betulae sp. nov. and D.\nbetulicola sp. nov. are introduced in this paper, with illustrations,\ndescriptions and support from internal transcribed spacer (ITS),\ncalmodulin (cal), histone H3 (his), translation elongation factor 1-α\n(tef1-α) and beta-tubulin (β-tub2) multigene phylogeny. Diaporthe\nbetulae is characterized by hyaline, ellipsoidal, aseptate, biguttulate,\n8.511 × 34 µm alpha conidia, with a known distribution in Sichuan\nProvince, China. Diaporthe betulicola is characterized by pycnidial\nstromata with a single locule with one ostiole per disc. Alpha conidia\nare hyaline, oblong, aseptate, not biguttulate and 9.914.7 × 1.32.5 µm,\nand beta conidia are hyaline, spindle-shaped, curved, aseptate, 1724 ×\n0.71.2 µm, and was found in Shaanxi Province, China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe from Betula spp. ITS-CAL-His-TEF-TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97657.phy"}]}
