Sparassis latifolia sp. nov. from boreal coniferous forests in\nChina is described based on morphological, ecological, geographical, and\nmolecular data. The nuclear gene phylogeny strongly supported groups\ncorresponding to morphological differences, geographic distribution and\nhost shifts among species that produce clamp connections, such as S.\ncrispa from Europe, S. radicata from western North America, and S.\nlatifolia from Asia. The atp6 phylogeny, however, showed no divergence\namong these three species. For clampless Sparassis species, such as S.\nspathulata from eastern North America, S. brevipes and a new species\nfrom Europe, the atp6 phylogeny was congruent with the nuclear gene\nphylogeny. Sparassis cystidiosa is basal in the nuclear tree but sister\nto S. brevipes \u001a S. spathulata clade in the ATP6 tree. The differences\nbetween the phylogenetic inferences from the atp6 gene and those from\nnuclear genes within Sparassis species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP Tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparassis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_566.phy"}]}
