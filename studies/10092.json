Isolates are\ntypically off-white to pale pink or black on solid media, while some\ntropical isolates have been described as color variants with bright\npigments of red, yellow or purple. We sequenced 5 loci (internal\ntranscribed spacer, intergenic spacer 1, translation elongation factor-1\nalpha, beta tubulin, and RNA polymerase II) from 45 new isolates from\nThailand. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, isolates were classified\ninto 12 clades. Each clade showed different colors on different culture\nmedia including two clades with color variants and some clades exhibited\nhigh levels of pullulan production or xylanase activity. Colony\ncharacteristics do not correlate perfectly with DNA sequence phylogeny\nor the physiological characters, but DNA sequence differences rapidly\nidentify isolates with genetic novelty.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aureobasidium pullulans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aureobasidium pullulans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6496.phy"}]}
