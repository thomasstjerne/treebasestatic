P. matheranensis is\nmorphologically distinguished by small basidiomes having ruby red pileus\nwith concolorous stipe, yellow hymenophore that stains blue to blackish\nblue on bruising, elongate ellipsoid to cylindrical basidiospores with\ninconspicuous suprahilar depression, ventricose to clavate\ncheilocystidia, ventricose to lageniform pleurocystidia. Further,\nextensive phylogenetic analyses based on five gene markers (nrITS,\nnrLSU, rpb1, rpb2, tef1-Î±) confirmed that P. matheranensis is distinct\nfrom its closest taxa P. aokii and P. pseudoaokii and also from other\nmembers of Boletoideae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129487","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129487.phy"}]}
