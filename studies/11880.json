{"Authors":" Juan Larraín, Dietmar Quandt, Jesús Muñoz","Year":" 2011","Title":" Bucklandiella araucana (Grimmiaceae), a new species from\nChile","Journal":" The Bryologist","Volume":" 114","Issue":" 4","Pages":"","Keywords":" Bryophyta, taxonomy, molecular phylogeny, Racomitrium","DOI":"","Abstract":" The new species Bucklandiella araucana Larraín is\ndescribed from southern Chile. It is characterized by its small size,\nepilose, almost cucullate leaves, lack of a differentiated basal\nmarginal row of pellucid and straight-walled cells, bistratose and\ndorsally flat costa at midleaf, smooth to slightly bulging lamina cells,\nunistratose leaf lamina with scattered bistratose spots at distal\nmargins, undivided, prong-like peristome teeth, and deeply lobed\ncalyptra. The species seems to be an endemic of the volcanic range of\nthe western slopes of the southern Andes (3942ºS), where it grows in\nNothofagus forests and open lava fields on the hillsides of the many\nactive volcanoes of the area. Molecular data support the distinctiveness\nof this new taxon and identify Bucklandiella araucana as sister to B.\ncuriosissima, B. didyma, and B. emersa. A distribution map and\nillustrations of the new species are presented. The phylogenetic\nperspectives of our novel molecular results are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 no sic","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48524.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48523.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48520.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48521.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48522.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 sic","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bucklandiella araucana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48525.phy"}]}
