Hook.f. species complex (O. ledifolius, O.\nericifolius Hook.f., and O. purpurascens DC.), collected throughout\nTasmania, Australia, revealed the existence of more taxa than hitherto\nrecognised. Morphometric and genotyping analyses of specimens showed\ngood support for O. ledifolius and O. ericifolius as currently\ncircumscribed, and clarified the existence of four additional, distinct\ntaxa: Ozothamnus purpurascens, with revised and clarified typification;\nO. reflexus (N.T.Burb.) de Salas & Schmidt-Leb., comb. & stat.\nnov., a taxon to which the name O. purpurascens was previously\nmisapplied; O. buchananii Puttock ex de Salas & Schmidt-Leb. sp.\nnov., a novel taxon from mid-high altitudes in north-eastern Tasmania;\nand O. floribundus de Salas & Schmidt-Leb. sp. nov., a rare and\nhighly localised novel taxon in lowland south-eastern Tasmania.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP mean char diff","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96858.phy"}]}
