Six orders of charophyte green algae, in\naddition to embryophytes, comprise the Streptophyta s.l. Previous\nstudies have focused on reconstructing the phylogeny of organisms tied\nto this key colonization event, but wildly conflicting results have\nsparked a contentious debate over which lineage gave rise to land\nplants. The dominant view has been that ‘stoneworts,’ or Charales, are\nthe sister lineage, but an alternative hypothesis supports the\nZygnematales (often referred to as “pond scum”) as the sister lineage.\nIn this paper, we provide a well-supported, 160-nuclear-gene\nphylogenomic analysis supporting the Zygnematales as the closest living\nrelative to land plants. Our study makes two key contributions to the\nfield: 1) the use of an unbiased method to collect a large set of\northologs from deeply diverging species and 2) the use of these data in\ndetermining the sister lineage to land plants. We anticipate this\nupdated phylogeny not only will hugely impact lesson plans in\nintroductory biology courses, but also will provide a solid phylogenetic\ntree for future green-lineage research, whether it be related to plants\nor green algae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diversity of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_22195.phy"}]}
