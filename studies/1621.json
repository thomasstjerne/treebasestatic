This\ntaxon has been placed in tribe Neillieae of Rosaceae based on its\nfollicular fruits and persistent stipules, but it is anomalous in the\ntribe due to lack of endosperm, while some of its other characters, such\nas opposite leaves, lack of well developed hypanthium, and postgenitally\nfused styles, are unusual for the entire family. No other taxonomic\nplacement has ever been proposed for Guamatela, however, and\nmorphological characters alone do not suggest any likely alternative. We\nextracted DNA from two herbarium specimens of G. tuerckheimii, one\ncollected in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico in 1969 and the other in Cerro\nPinalón, San Augustin Acasaguastlán, Guatemala in 2000. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of the chloroplast rbcL, atpB, and matK genes amplified from\nthe materials, along with sequences from representatives of most major\ngroups in eudicots, strongly support Guamatela as a member of the rosid\norder Crossosomatales as circumscribed in APG II. None of the molecular\ndata support the inclusion of Guamatela in any described family in the\norder, and the unique combination of morphological characters of the\ngenus would not fit the description of any of those families. Based on\nthese results, we here proposed a new family name Guamatelaceae to\naccommodate this genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Guamatelaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_737.phy"}]}
