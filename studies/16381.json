A current aim in speciation\nresearch is to identify conditions in which selection overcomes this\nprocess. We focused on a state of limited differentiation, asking if\nselection enables divergence-with-gene-flow in a set of Habronattus\namericanus jumping spider populations that exhibit three distinct male\nsexual display morphs. We found that each population is at high\nfrequency or fixed for a single morph. These strong phenotypic\ndifferences contrast with low divergence at 210 AFLP markers, suggesting\nselection has driven or maintains morph divergence. Coinciding patterns\nof isolation-by-distance and “isolation-by-phenotype” (i.e., increased\ngenetic divergence among phenotypically contrasting populations) across\nthe study area support several alternative demographic hypotheses for\ndisplay divergence, each of which entails gene flow. Display-associated\nstructure appears broadly distributed across the genome and the markers\nproducing this pattern do not stand out from background levels of\ndifferentiation. Overall, the results suggest selection can promote\nstark sexual display divergence in the face of gene flow among closely\nrelated populations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Habronattus americanus ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77667.phy"}]}
