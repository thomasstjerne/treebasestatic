Polygamy,\ndioecy, and hermaphroditism all occur within a New World clade of Galium\n(Rubiaceae), in which dioecy is hypothesized to have evolved from\nhermaphroditism via polygamy. At least five sections of Galium as\ntraditionally defined by fruit morphology occur within this group. We\ntested the monophyly of sections defined by fruit morphology and sought\nto determine origins and pathways of breeding systems within this\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian con all compat w/pp","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7457","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7457.phy"}]}
