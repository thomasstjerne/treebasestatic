Species\ndelimitation and placement within one of three species groups was based\non modifications of the male copulatory device. Because a phylogeny of\nthe group was not available these species groups might not represent\nmonophyletic lineages; species definitions likewise were untested\nhypotheses. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct the phylogeny of\nMyrmekiaphila species using molecular data to formally test the\ndelimitation of species and species-groups. We seek to refine a set of\nestablished systematic hypotheses by integrating across molecular and\nmorphological data sets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Myr12S16S Final","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrmekiaphila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20801.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myrmek192fin Final","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrmekiaphila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20803.phy"},{"tree_label":"MyrConcat Final","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrmekiaphila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20802.phy"}]}
