Here we present\nevidence that shows members of the unicellular non-heterocyst\ndifferentiating genus Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria are each otherÇs closest living relatives.\nDistance, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of complete\nsmall subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences yielded highly congruent\nsupport for the monophyly of Chroococcidiopsis and the heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the order\nPleurocapsales which traditionally contains Chroococcidiopsis is a\npolyphyletic assemblage with the ability to reproduce by multiple\nfission having arisen independently at least twice during the\ncyanobacterial radiation. Our data also rejects Myxosarcina as a sister\ntaxon to Chroococcidiopsis indicating that the numerous presumed shared\nderived characters thought to unite the two genera evolved\nindependently. The sequence divergence within the Chroococcidiopsis\nlineage is comparable to and probably exceeds that in the entire\nheterocyst differentiating lineage. Chroococcidiopsis forms unique\nsurvival cells under nitrogen limiting conditions, and the sister-group\nrelationship with the heterocystous cyanobacteria shown here suggests\nthat differentiation of these cells and heterocysts may be related\nprocesses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5677.phy"},{"tree_label":"User-defined: Chroococcidiopsis most","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5678.phy"},{"tree_label":"User-defined: Myxosarcina and Chrooco","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5679.phy"},{"tree_label":"User-defined Pleurocapsales monophyl","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chroococcidiopsis and filamentous heterocyst\ndifferentiating cyanobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5680.phy"}]}
