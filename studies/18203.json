In the present study we firstly observed T.\nconstricta from Sinsi Island in Korean coastal water on 6 May 2014. This\nspecies was isolated and cultured, and the fine structures were\nobserved. In addition, the nuclear (SSU and partial LSU rDNA) and\nchloroplast genes (psbC and rbcL) were analyzed to confirm the position\nof the species. Thalassiosira constricta was morphologically\ncharacterized (1) chain forming colony by mucilage thread extruded from\nthe clustered central fultoportulae or by directly abutting valve face,\n(2) valve structure with a delicate biseriate poroid areolae along the\nradial ribs in the valve face and coarse loculate areolae in the valve\nmantle, (3) 0â“14 clustered central fultoportulae, (4) one ring of\nmarginal fultoportulae, (5) a single rimoportula between the marginal\nfultoportulae, (6) distinct antiligula in the valve, (7) cingulum\nstructure consist of the finely perforated valvocoupla and copula, and\nthe scratched pleurae. In the molecular analysis, the rDNA sequences of\nT. constricta was almost close to Bacterosira bathyomphala and identical\nto Bacterosira sp. CCMP991. The overall morphological features of T.\nconstricta not only matched to Bacterosira rather than Thalassiosira,\nbut the molecular data supported the relationship with Bacterosira.\nBased on the morphological and molecular characters, we suggested that\nT. constricta should be transfer to the genus Bacterosira, and emended\nthe description of the genus Bacterosira.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90879.phy"}]}
