There is limited understanding of the genome-wide\nevolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi\nadapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences\nand reproductive isolation. Here we assess genomic evidence for such\nevolutionary processes by extending our recent work on Grosmannia\nclavigera, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey\npine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional eleven G.\nclavigera sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species,\nGrosmannia sp. (Gs) and G. clavigera (Gc). The twelve fungal genomes are\nstructurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between\nspecies. We identified 103,430 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that\nseparated the Grosmannia strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and\nfurther divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which\nmay represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between\nthese lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes,\nas well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As\nthese variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in\ndetoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g. polyketide\nsynthases, oxidoreductases, monooxygenases), their variants may reflect\nadaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees Pinus contorta,\nP. ponderosa, and P. jeffreyi. This work provides a comprehensive\nresource for developing informative markers for landscape population\ngenomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an\napproach that could be extended to other beetle-tree associated\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
