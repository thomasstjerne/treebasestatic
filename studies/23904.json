In this study, M. mumecola isolates from different\nlocations and hosts were used to analyze the genetic diversity and to\nassay the sensitivity to four generally used fungicides, cabendazim,\ntebuconazole, azoxystrobin and boscalid, respectively. Results showed\nthat isolates from different locations tended to be separated.\nInterestingly, isolates from different hosts (e.g., peach, apricot) at\nthe same locations generally clustered together, indicating that the M.\nmumecola isolates may infect different hosts in the same areas. The\nfungicide sensitivity assay of 93 M. mumecola isolates showed that the\naverage EC50 values for carbendazim, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin and\nboscalid were 0.103, 0.034, 0.325 and 0.419 Âµg/ml, respectively. The\nsensitivity distributions of the tested isolates to the four fungicides\nshowed continuous unimodal curves, indicating no qualitative shift of\nresistance. No significant difference of sensitivity to tested\nfungicides was observed among isolated from either different locations\nor different hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monilia mumecola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116697.phy"}]}
