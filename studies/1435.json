A phylogenetic\nanalysis based on sequence data from the plastid genes rbcL and matK is\npresented, using 59 species of Dioscorea and covering all the main Old\nWorld and selected New World lineages. The analysis used 25 outgroup\ntaxa, including Trichopus Gaertn., Tacca J.R. & G. Forster,\nStenomeris Planch., and Burmanniaceae Blume. The main findings are; a)\nthat a clade of rhizomatous taxa are sister to the rest of Dioscorea; b)\nthe main Old World groups (such as the right-twining D. sect.\nEnantiophyllum) are monophyletic and represent the crown clades of\nDioscorea; and c) there are two distinct lineages among the Malagasy\nendemic taxa. The impact of the results on the infrageneric\nclassification of Dioscorea is considered, in particular the possibility\nof greatly simplifying the classifications of Knuth and Burkill. It is\nalso used to present novel hypotheses of character evolution in key\nunderground organ, inflorescence, fruit and seed characters and the\norigins of diversity in Dioscorea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig, 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr2301","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2301.phy"}]}
