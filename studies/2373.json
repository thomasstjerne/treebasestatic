Two economically important species, Z. jujuba\nand Z. mauritiana, are cultivated for their fruit. Given the economic\nimportance of these two species, we undertook a reexamination of the\nintrageneric phylogenetic relationships to identify their closest\nrelatives and to test two alternative intrageneric classifications.\nThese two classifications were tested by using a simultaneous analysis\nof morphological characters together with nuclear (ITS and 26S rDNA) and\nplastid (trnL-F spacer) genes. The Old World and New World species of\nZiziphus formed two separate well supported clades. The Old World\nspecies of Ziziphus are more closely related to Paliurus than to the New\nWorld species, thereby rendering Ziziphus paraphyletic. Sarcomphalus is\nplaced within the New World Ziziphus clade, which supports the transfer\nof Sarcomphalus to Ziziphus. The earlier placement of Condaliopsis in\nZiziphus was supported for one species previously placed in\nCondaliopsis, Z. obtusifolia, but was contradicted for the other\nCondaliopsis-like species, Z. celata. Ziziphus celata is more closely\nrelated to Rhamneae than it is to Paliureae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict 26S","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ziziphus, 26S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4635.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ziziphus, trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ziziphus, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ziziphus, morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict All Chars","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ziziphus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4639.phy"}]}
