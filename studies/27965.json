Antipathozoanthus\ntubus sp. nov. is characterized by its substrate (epibiotic on\npolychaete tube) and habitat (exposed rock). As well, the results of\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses using concatenated multiple genetic\nmarkers also support the distinc- tion between A. tubus sp. nov. and its\ncongenerics. Antipathozoanthus tubus sp. nov. is the first species of\nAntipathozoanthus species reported to be epibiotic on polychaete tubes,\nand is the second species in the genus that is not associated with\nantipatharians.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parazoanthidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133440.phy"}]}
