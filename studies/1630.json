In the course of our phylogenetic research on the New World\nmarsupial family Didelphidae, we sequenced 2790 bp of the RAG1 exon from\nexemplar species of most extant genera. Phylogenetic analysis of these\nsequences recovered an anomalous node consisting of two clades\npreviously shown to be distantly related based on analyses of other\nmolecular data. These two clades show significantly increased GC content\nat RAG1 third codon positions, and the resulting convergence in base\ncomposition is strong enough to overwhelm phylogenetic signal from other\ngenes (and morphology) in most analyses of concatenated datasets. This\nbase-compositional convergence occurred relatively recently (over tens\nrather than hundreds of millions of years), and the affected gene region\nis still in a state of evolutionary disequilibrium. Both mutation rate\nand substitution rate are higher in GC-rich didelphid taxa, observations\nconsistent with RAG1 sequences having experienced a higher rate of\nrecombination in the convergent lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_762.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_760.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_761.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_763.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_764.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didelphid Marsupials","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_765.phy"}]}
