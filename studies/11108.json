On either side of Wallaces Line many\nangiosperms display high species richness, whereas along the line in\nWallacea, lineages are characterized by low species diversity. This\nbimodal biogeographical pattern is best exemplified in Livistoninae\npalms. To understand the evolution of this bimodal pattern and its\ncorrelations to Wallace’s Line, molecular phylogenies were inferred from\nseven gene regions and the bimodal distributions of Licuala, Livistona,\nand Saribus across Wallace’s Line were investigated. From the\ninter-generic relationships, divergence times, and biogeography, we\ntested the origin, composition, and dynamics of the bimodal\nbiogeographic pattern. Phylogenies resolved well-supported generic\nrelationships and support for the recognition of a new genus, Lanonia.\nOur results show that, contrary to previous studies, bimodal\ndistributional patterns associated with Wallace’s Line do not represent\ncolonizations from both the east and west, but rather dispersal from the\nwest into the east occurring after the Miocene collision of the Sunda\nand Sahul plates. The paucity of species in Wallacea that causes\nbimodality can be attributed to Pleistocene climatic changes, but many\nalternative hypotheses cannot be rejected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Livistoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26476.phy"}]}
