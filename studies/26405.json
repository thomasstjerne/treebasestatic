Coryneum was the only genus in Coryneaceae and Hyaloterminalis\nhas similar morphological character to Coryneum by broadly fusiform\nbrown conidia. However, Hyaloterminalis differs from species of Coryneum\nby pycnidial conidiomata, paraphyses, nature of the conidiophores, long\nnarrow hyaline tip of the apical cell and hyaline basal cells. Multigene\nphylogenetic analyses, using partial sequences from the 28S nrRNA gene\n(LSU), internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA\ngene (ITS) of the nrDNA operon and the translation elongation factor\n1-alpha region (TEF) generated from maximum likelihood, maximum\nparsimony and MrBayes analyses, demonstrated Hyaloterminalis\nalishanensis that forms a distinct lineage within the family Coryneaceae\nand its establishment as a new genus is supported. The new taxon is\ncompared with genus Coryneum and descriptions, illustrations, appraisal\non taxonomy for the taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123952","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123952.phy"}]}
