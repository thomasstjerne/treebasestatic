Based on morphological characteristics, and phylogenetic\nanalyses of combined LSU, ITS, SSU, TEF1-Î±, and RPB2 sequence data, two\nnew species Distoseptispora bankokensis and D. lancangjiangensis are\nintroduced, and two known species D. clematidis and D. thysanolaenae\nwere first reported in freshwater habitat. Illustrations and\ndescriptions of these taxa are provided, along with comparisons with\nextant taxa in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133463","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133463.phy"}]}
