During an ongoing survey of\nbambusicolous fungi in southwest China and Thailand, we collected a\nsubmerged decaying branch of bamboo from Sichuan Province, China and an\nOphioceras species occurring on this substrate was observed and\nisolated. An Ophioceras taxon was delimited based on morphological\ncharacteristics and combined LSU, RPB1 and ITS sequence analyses and is\ndescribed as Ophioceras sichuanense sp. nov. The species formed a\nwell-supported clade basal to Ophioceras (99% ML, 1.00 PP). Based on the\nupdated phylogenetic tree of Magnaporthales, Ceratosphaerella\ncastillensis (generic type) and C. rhizomorpha formed a clade within\nOphioceras and morphologically resemble Ophioceras. Therefore,\nCeratosphaerella is synonymized under Ophioceras. The phylogenetic\nrelationships of Ophioceras are discussed in relation to morphological\nsimilarities of genera in Magnaporthales. The generic circumscription of\nOphioceras is emended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131116.phy"}]}
