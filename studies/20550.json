Najas\nancistrocarpa is one of the rarest and least known East Asian species of\nthe c. 3040 species of the aquatic plant genus Najas (Hydrocharitaceae).\nWe used a recently discovered collection of this nationally and\nregionally endangered species in Japan and East Asia to assess whether\nN. ancistrocarpa is a distinct species or an untypical form of other\nNajas species and to evaluate its conservation priority in a\nphylogenetic context. The sample set of our previous study, exploring\nworldwide phylogeny of the genus was used with N. ancistrocarpa to\ndelimit species boundaries in Najas and obtain conservation priority\nscores, calculated by multiplying evolutionary distinctiveness and\nglobal extinction risks converted from Red List categories. We performed\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses of plastid (ptDNA) and nuclear (ITS) DNA\ndatasets, STACEY species delimitation analysis using the multilocus\ndataset and a measurement of conservation priority with Tuatara. Najas\nancistrocarpa was consistently placed in ptDNA and ITS trees. Species\ndelimitation analysis objectively assessed that N. ancistrocarpa is\nphylogenetically distinct. Phylogenetic conservation prioritization\nranked N. ancistrocarpa the second highest priority species of the genus\nNajas. Overall, in terms of biodiversity conservation, N. ancistrocarpa\nrepresents an important Najas species in Japan and probably the\nworld.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108641","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108641.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Najas ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108650.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108640","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108640.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108651.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108652.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Najas ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108639.phy"}]}
