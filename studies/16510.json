The\napproximately ten species display a great morphological variability and\noverlapping taxonomic boundaries, which makes it difficult to\ndifferentiate them (particularly in the Caribbean region). We\ninvestigated the phylogenetic relationships of Rochefortia using DNA\nsequence data from one nuclear locus (Internal Transcribed Spacer) and\nthree chloroplast DNA loci (rps16, trnLâ“trnF, trnSâ“trnG). The\nmonophyly of Rochefortia was confirmed, with a sister group relationship\nbetween an American mainland clade and a Caribbean clade. The latter\nsegregates into three, morphologically rather variable lineages,\ndistributed either in the Lesser Antilles or in the eastern Greater\nAntilles or in the western Greater Antilles. Thus, geographic occurrence\nrather than morphology is indicative for taxonomic delimitation in\nRochefortia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rochefortia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78419.phy"}]}
