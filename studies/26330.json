The genus is currently divided into 28 sections\nbased on phylogenetic and morphological evidence. Alternaria formosana\nsp. nov. associated with leaf blight of Ficus sp. and leaf spot of\nKandelia candel in mangroves in Taiwan is introduced based on\nphylogenetic analyses and morphological characters. The new species is\ncharacterized by macronematous conidiophores, sympodial, polytretic\nconidiogenous cells and obclavate to obovoid, muriform conidia gradually\ntapering towards beaked apex. Phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS,\nLSU, SSU, and EF1Î± sequence data supports the placement of the new\nspecies in Alternaria section Alternaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123813","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123813.phy"}]}
