It causes diseases on a wide\nrange of economically important plants including peach. China is the\nlargest producer of peach in the world but little is known about\nColletotrichum spp. affecting the crop. During 2017 and 2018, a total of\n286 Colletotrichum isolates were isolated from symptomatic fruit and\nleaves in 11 peach production provinces of China. Based on the\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2,\nand HIS3) and morphological characterization, the isolates were\nidentified to be C. nymphaeae, C. fioriniae, and C. godetiae of the C.\nacutatum species complex, C. fructicola and C. siamense of the C.\ngloeosporioides species complex, C. karstii of the C. boninense species\ncomplex, and one newly identified species, C. folicola. This study\npresents the first report of C. karstii and C. godetiae on peach, and\nthe first report of C. nymphaeae, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, and C.\nsiamense on peach in China. Pathogenicity tests revealed that all\nspecies obtained in this study were pathogenic on both leaves and fruit\nof peach, except for C. folicola which only infected leaves. The present\nstudy substantially improves our understanding of the causal agents of\nanthracnose on peaches in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
