Most sporocarp-forming AM fungi belong to the\ngenus Glomus sensu lato, but their phylogenetic positions remain unknown\ndue to lack of their molecular data. In the course of field surveys of\ntruffle-like fungi throughout Japan, we collected sporocarps that had\nidentical morphological characteristics to those of Glomus microcarpum\nTul. & C. Tul. from several localities. Although G. microcarpum is\none of the first described Glomus species, its phylogenetic position\nremains unknown thus far. We therefore conducted phylogenetic analyses\nbased on partial 18Sinternal transcribed spacerpartial 28S (SSU-ITS-LSU)\nregions of nuclear rDNA, which are recommended as the barcoding regions\nfor AM fungi. The resultant trees indicated that this species is\ngenetically distant to any of the genera included in the latest\nconsensus classification of Glomaraceae (i.e., Glomus, Funneliformis,\nRhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Septoglomus), but is nested within the\nrecently described genus Kamienskia Błaszk., Chwat & Kovács in this\nfamily. Accordingly, we propose a new combination Kamienskia microcarpa\n(Tul. & C. Tul.) Yamato & Orihara for G. microcarpum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree for Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113354","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_113354.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tee for Fig. S1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113359","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_113359.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree for Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113351","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_113351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114150.phy"}]}
