This has resulted in a lack of\nDNA sequence data in public databases to better resolve species\ntaxonomy. The main criterion for specific classification therefore\nrelied heavily on host association. Fresh collections from living leaves\nof Croton persimilis and Tamarindus indica with black colonies in Mae\nFah Luang University, Thailand yielded a new species, Irenopsis\ncrotonicola sp. nov and a new record of Meliola tamarindi. These taxa\nare described and phenotypic comparisons are made with known species. To\nbetter classify the putative novel species that cannot be cultivated, we\noutline the protocol to extract DNA from fruiting bodies and generate\nnew phylogenetic data. Results indicate that this direct DNA extraction\nmethod is suitable to yield quality DNA sufficient for PCR\namplifications of several commonly used DNA regions in fungal\nsystematics. The 28S rDNA phylogram generated confirms the position of\nour taxa within Meliolaceae and indicate a close relationship of\nIrenopsis crotonicola sp. nov to I. walsurae. Sequences of tef,\nÎ²-tubulin and GPDH regions of Meliolaceae are provided as well.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107962.phy"}]}
