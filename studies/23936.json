Recent studies on tropical Agaricus revealed new\ntropical clades and a revised taxonomic system was consequently\ndeveloped. Agaricus subg. Minoriopsis, a sixth subgenus was recently\nadded, comprising species exclusively from the Americas. The diversity\nof Agaricus is little studied in Mexico, despite this country has a long\nhistory in the consumption of wild edible fungi. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new species A. guzmanii and a new record species A.\nglobocystidiatus from Mexico based on morphological and molecular data.\nPhylogenetic analyses indicate that they belong to A. subg.\nMinoriopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115787.phy"}]}
