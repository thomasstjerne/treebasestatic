Recent re-examination of receptacular and\nappendage characters present in the holotype led to its transfer to the\ngenus Mimeomyces. Fresh collections of this fungus have provided the\nopportunity to re-assess its taxonomic position. Based on a combination\nof morphological and molecular characters, this species is re-instated\nwithin the genus Corethromyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corethromyces bicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1218.phy"}]}
