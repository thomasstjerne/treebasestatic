Gastrotrichs\nare important members of the aquatic environments and important players\nin the study of animal evolution. In spite of their ecological an\nevolutionary importance, their internal relationships are not well\nunderstood yet. We have produced new sequences for the 18S rDNA gene to\nimprove the taxon sampling for the gastrotrichs, not only in quantity\nbut also in quality (genera and families sampled). Our phylogeny\nrecovers the monophyly of the two main Gastrotricha clades, at\ndifference with recent studies with similar sampling, and displays a\ngreat level of resemblance with morphology based analyses. However, our\ntopology is not able to solve the first branches of the macrodasyidans\nor settle the position of the puzzling Neodasys, a controversial genus\nclassified as a chaetonotidan on morphological grounds, but placed\nwithin macrodasyidans by the molecular studies. This analysis is the\nmore exhaustive molecular phylogeny of the phylum to date, significantly\nincreasing our knowledge of gastrotrich evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47777.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47778.phy"}]}
