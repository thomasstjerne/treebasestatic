The\nresults suggest that Saxifragales as well as most major infraordinal\nclades lack unambiguous morphological synapomorphies among the\ncharacters examined; that the major linages of Saxifragales were\ndistinct by ca. 90-70 Ma; and that the ca. 90 Ma taxa lack\ncharacteristic derived features present in modern taxa. General\nconclusions concerning the advantages of joint extinct-extant taxon\nphylogenetic analyses explored herein include: 1) Prediction of the\nmorphological characters present in early members of a clade; 2)\nDetermination of minimum ages for lineage divergences; 3) Resolution of\nthe order in which synapomorphies may have evolved; and 4)\nCircumscription of the time interval during which synapomorphies may\nhave evolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 + 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2526.phy"}]}
