DNA was isolated from 44 CBS- strains (7 Dermea, 3\nNeofabraea and 34 Pezicula species). Parsimony analysis confirmed the\nmorphology-based hypothesis that Ocellaria ocellata should be considered\nas a true Pezicula species. Furthermore, the position of two taxa\n(Pezicula malicorticis and Pezicula alnicola) was found to be outside\nthe Pezicula main cluster.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezicula, Dermea and Neofabraea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezicula, Dermea and Neofabraea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1122.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezicula, Dermea and Neofabraea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1123.phy"}]}
