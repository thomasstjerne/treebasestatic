Here we reanalyse the bacterial\nphylogeny based on rRNA using a more reliable approach, and find that\nhyperthermophilic bacteria (such as Aquificales and Thermotogales) do\nnot emerge first, suggesting that the Bacteria had a\nnon-hyperthermophilic ancestor. It seems that Planctomycetales, a phylum\nwith numerous peculiarities, could be the first emerging bacterial\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4037.phy"}]}
