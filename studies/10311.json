While many morphological\ngroupings have been upheld, such as the alethinophidians (all living\nsnakes excluding blindsnakes) and caenophidians (filesnakes plus\ncolubroids), others have been convincingly overturned. In particular,\nthe large-gaped tropidophiines are very basal alethinophidians related\nto Anilius, while the relatively primitive Xenopeltis and Loxocemus are\nthe nearest relatives of pythons. The new molecular phylogeny refutes\nthe widespread view that snake evolution involved gradual elaboration of\nfeeding mechanisms, culminating in an advanced “macrostomatan” clade.\nInstead, molecular evidence suggests large gape was primitive for snakes\n(or at least alethinophidians), and reduced repeatedly in many basal,\nburrowing alethinophidians as well as further elaborated at least twice;\nthis view is consistent with some interpretations of the snake fossil\nrecord. Some (but not all) of the new molecular clades exhibit\nmorphological novelties that support their reality. A revised molecular\nclock analysis of snakes, using five robust fossil calibrations,\nproduces more recent dates for all snake lineages compared to previous\nmolecular clock studies. These shallower dates are much more consistent\nwith the broader fossil record of reptiles, implying far shorter ghost\nlineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"strict","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Major Clades of Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6790.phy"}]}
