Most\nspecies are kleptoparasites in nests of solitary aculeate wasps and\nbees, although parasitoids and saprophagous species are also known, and\nthe ancestral miltogrammine life habit remains unsettled. Here, we\npresent for the first time a comprehensive phylogenetic tree consisting\nof 58 representatives of Miltogramminae, reconstructed using sequence\ndata from three mitochondrial (COI, cytB, ND4) and one nuclear (Ef-1 a )\ngenes. Our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that: (1) Miltogramminae are\nsister to Paramacronychiinae, (2) Miltogramminae can be divided into the\n’’lower miltogrammines containing two clades of mainly saprophages and a\nclade of ’’higher miltogrammines with mainly kleptoparasitic species,\n(3) only three genera turn out to be non-monophyletic: Miltogramma,\nSenotainia and Pterella and (4) the genus Sarcotachina, which\ntraditionally has been consid- ered as belonging to the\nParamacronychiinae, is placed in one of the clades of ’’lower\nmiltogrammines. Ancestral state reconstruction of larval feeding\nstrategy and five larval characters reveals that the ances- tor of\nMiltogramminae was likely a saprophage retaining plesiomorphic oral\nridges and a cephaloskeleton with sclerotized dorsal bridge.\nSynapomorphies like large pseudocephalic sensory organs and\nwell-developed cuticular sculpture suggest that the ancestral first\ninstar larva actively searched for a buried food supply.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Miltogramminae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102549.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Miltogramminae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102550.phy"}]}
