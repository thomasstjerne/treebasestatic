The fungus was\nisolated from Melica uniflora Retz growing in Bad Harzburg, Germany.\nPhylogenetic reconstruction using a combined dataset of the tubB and\ntefA genes strongly support that E. scottii is a distinct species and\nthe so far unknown ancestor species of the hybrid E. disjuncta. A\ndistribution analysis showed a high infection rate in close vicinity of\nthe initial sampling site and only two more spots with low infection\nrates. Genetic variations in key genes required for alkaloid production\nsuggested that E. scottii sp. nov. might not be capable of producing any\nof the major alkaloids including ergot alkaloid, loline,\nindole-diterpene and peramine. All isolates and individuals found in the\ndistribution analysis were identified as mat-ing-type B explaining the\nlack of mature stromata during this study. We further release a\ntelo-mere-to-telomere de novo assembly of all seven chromosomes and the\nmitogenome of E. scottii sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133006","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133006.phy"}]}
