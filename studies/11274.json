The concept of niche and\nassociated theories predicts that competition for suitable habitat and\navailable ecological space lead to a ceiling in species richness that\ninfluences further diversification patterns. By contrast, the neutral\ntheory supports that speciation is stochastic and diversity-independent.\nWe examined community structure and phylogenetic diversification rates\nin three families and 14 sites within coral reef fish communities from\nthe Indian and Pacific oceans. Using the phylogenetic relationships\namong 157 species estimated with 2300-bp of mitochondrial DNA, we tested\npredictions in terms of species coexistence from the neutral and niche\ntheories. Our findings demonstrate that community phylogenetic structure\nshifts during community assembly to a pattern of dispersion as a\nconsequence of allopatric speciation at the regional scale and\nphylogenetic conservatism of habitat use at the local scale.\nFurthermore, we found evidence for a negative feedback of community\nfilling on diversification suggesting that species interactions in\necological communities influence macroevolutionary patterns. Finally,\nour results show that community assembly is not a random process and\nthat ecological drivers in communities are important factors in shaping\ncommunities structure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"259","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31079.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"217","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31080.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCL","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_30073.phy"}]}
