Despite their ecological\nand economic importance, the phylogenetic relationships among the\nconstituent species remain ambiguous due to the lack of convincing\nmorphological characters and paucity of molecular data for the majority\nof the non-model species in the family. In this study, our multilocus\nphylogeny suggests that both Magnaporthe and Gaeumannomyces are\npolyphyletic genera. The phylogeny also provides insights into fungal\nbiology and pathogenesis. Magnaporthe oryzae formed a basal clade, while\nM. poae and M. rhizophila formed another well-supported clade with G.\nincrustans, G. graminis and M. salvinii. The basal species infects both\nroot and aerial parts of plant host, while the aerial infection capacity\nseems to be lost in the taxa of the latter clade. The study indicates\nthat anamorphic and ecological features are more informative than the\nteleomorphic characters in defining monophyletic groups among these\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthaceae MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31302.phy"}]}
