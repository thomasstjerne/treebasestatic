Therefore, we\npropose the fungus as a new species under the name of Erysiphe\njavanicus. Differences of this new species from closely related Erysiphe\nspecies are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49684.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49685.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49686.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49675.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49687.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49681.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49683.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49689.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49688.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49673.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49674.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49678.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49677.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49676.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49690.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49680.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49679.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery Mildew on Castanopsis javanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49682.phy"}]}
