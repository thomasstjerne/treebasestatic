All the genera in this subfamily are\ntherefore considered to have evolved from a common ancestor, based on\nthe possession of character states which distinguish this complex from\nall other genera of the Asphodelaceae. However, no comprehensive\ninterpretation of phylogenetic relationships within the entire subfamily\nbased on comparative morphological data and phytogeographical\nconsiderations has yet been accomplished. The present paper investigates\nphylogenetic relationships of the genera Aloe, Astroloba, Chortolirion,\nGasteria, Haworthia, Lomatophyllum and Poellnitzia using cladistic\nmethodology. The most obvious similarities amongst these genera are the\nsucculent leaf consistency, crescentiform or cymbiform leaf outline in\ncross-section and the markedly bimodal karyotype of 2n = 14 chromosomes.\nFor the cladistic analysis 16 characters were used and the genus\nKniphofia was selected as outgroup on the basis of two synapomorphies\nwith Alooideae, namely tubular flowers and fused perianth segments. The\ncharacters are discussed in detail, polarized into plesiomorphic and\napomorphic states and then employed in the generation of a phylogenetic\nhypothesis using the Hennig86 software package.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alooideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4263.phy"}]}
