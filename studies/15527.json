These alterations in host behavior\nprobably improve the chances that the subsequently produced fungal\nspores will be dispersed aerially.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71755.phy"}]}
