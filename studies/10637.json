The type specimen of this species\ncould not be located in any herbaria. Fresh specimens were therefore\ncollected from the location as stated in the protologue. Epitypes of C.\nfalcatum with a living culture are designated in order to stabilize the\napplication of the species name. The morphology of conidia and\nappressoria, cultural characters and growth rate for the epitype is\nprovided and its pathogenicity on some hosts is tested. Multi-gene\nsequences were generated and deposited in NCBI. Phylogenetic analysis\nshowed that C. falcatum cluster in a distinct lineage in the\ncurved-spored Colletotrichum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum falcatum ITS MAT APN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9880.phy"}]}
