The species was identified as Phoma glomerata\nand was demonstrated to effectively colonize and suppress development of\npowdery mildew.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished #2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phoma & Ampelomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1127.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phoma & Ampelomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1128.phy"}]}
