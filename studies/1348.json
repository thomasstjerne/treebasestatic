In culture it formed two types of conidia, namely fusiform,\nhyaline, aseptate conidia typical of the genus Fusicoccum, and\ndark-walled, ovoid, ellipsoid or fusiform, 1\u001a2 septate conidia that are\nnot typically observed in Fusicoccum. A phylogenetic analysis based on\nITS and EF1-alpha sequences placed the fungus within the same clade as\nFusicoccum aesculi, which is the anamorph of Botryosphaeria dothidea,\nand the type of the genus Fusicoccum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria dothidea causing fruit rot of\nolives","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4477.phy"}]}
