The species\nwas collected in Yunnan Province, where it grew on undersides of fallen\nangiosperm wood. I. jinshaensis is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, resupinate basidiocarps with white to cream pores when fresh\nbecoming salmon to cinnamon upon drying, a monomitic hyphal system,\ngenerative hyphae thick-walled with simple septa, the presence of\nencrusted cystidia and broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores.\nThe phylogenetic analysis based on ITS + nLSU rDNA sequences shows that\nthe new species belongs to Irpex, clustering together with I. hydnoides\nand I. lacteus with strong support (94% BS, 95% BP, 1.00 BPP). In\naddition, a new combination, I. subulatus, is also proposed based on\nmorphological and phylogenetic analysises. Both morphological and\nmolecular characters confirm the placement of the new species and\ncombination in Irpex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132800.phy"}]}
