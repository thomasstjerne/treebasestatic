The genus Andinobates is made\nup of 14 species, all distributed in Northwestern South America\n(Colombia and Northern Ecuador), and adjacent Panama. Within the last\ndecade, five species of this genus have been described. In this paper we\ndescribe yet another species, belonging to the Andinobates fulguritus\ngroup, from the Urabá region of Northwestern Colombia. The new species\ncan be distinguished from other members of Andinobates on the basis of a\nunique combination of coloration, size, and advertisement call\nparameters. Molecular phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses\ncorroborate the species taxonomic affinity, and further support its\nstatus as a distinct lineage. Finally, we discuss the implications of\nour findings on the systematics of the A. fulguritus group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendrobatidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107876.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendrobatidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107877.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML 16S","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendrobatidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107878.phy"}]}
