While C. ulcerosa has a maritime distribution in\nEurope, C. substerilis is typically a continental species. North\nAmerican continental lichens called “C. ulcerosa” are phylogenetically\ncloser and more similar to C. substerilis; (4) Caloplaca emilii, newly\ndescribed below, is the Mediterranean species closely related to C.\nareolata. It rarely occurs in higher latitudes in Austria, the Czech\nRepublic and Germany; (5) Caloplaca molariformis, newly described below,\nis a continental species with a marginal occurrence in southern\nSlovakia; it belongs to the subgenus Pyrenodesmia and is characterized\nby its thick thallus with fungal and algal tissues arranged in high\nstacks. The positions within Teloschistaceae of the taxa considered are\ndemonstrated by ITS phylogenies. The distributions of C. areolata, C.\nemilii and C. interfulgens are mapped. The new species are fully\ndescribed using more than hundred phenotype characters, and diagnostic\ncharacters are indicated separately.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian inference molariformis","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caloplaca molariformis group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60894.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian inference Interfulgens","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caloplaca interfulgens group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60896.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian inference Emili","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caloplaca emili group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60893.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian inference","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caloplaca ulcerosa group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian inference Crenularia","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caloplaca crenularia group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60895.phy"}]}
