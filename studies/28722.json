The species is especially common in\nopen vegetation, including urban environments. Hypotrachyna\nneohorrescens sp. nov. is morphologically and chemically similar to H.\nhorrescens. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses of the nuITS and mtSSU\nregions revealed that H. neohorrescens is a distinct species and closely\nrelated to the North American H. mcmulliniana, differing by the size of\nlaciniae and ascospores. In addition, we also verified the phylogenetic\npositioning of Brazilian specimens of Hypotrachyna minarum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133127","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133127.phy"}]}
