This new species\ndiffers markedly in morphology from previously known congeneric species.\nIt is characterized by its shrubby habit, with woody stems are up to 1 m\ntall. The leaves are clustered at the top of the woody stems, the\ninvolucral bracts are ovate and unequal, the bracteoles are usually\novate or suborbicular and the pedicels of the mature fruits exceed the\nbracteoles. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that Bupleurum\ndracaenoides belongs to a small subclade of subgenus Bupleurum and is\nsister to Bupleurum polyclonum. Relationships to other woody species of\nBupleurum are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict tree","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian trees","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian trees","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61186","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61186.phy"}]}
