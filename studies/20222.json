Inferred from phylogenies based on DNA sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) regions and the large subunit nuclear ribosomal\nRNA gene (nLSU), the sampled 35 species traditionally belong to\nPhysisporinus, Rigidoporus, and Oxyporus are nested mostly in five\nlineages: three lineages (including genera Physisporinus, Ceriporia and\nFlaviporus) belong to Polyoprales and two lineages (including genera\nRigidoporus and Bridgeoporus) belong to Hymenochaetales. In addition,\nsamples of R. hypobrunneus are scattered in other lineage in\nPolyoprales. Rigidoporus and Oxyporus are merged because the type\nspecies of both genera are nested in a single lineage within\nHymenochaetales. Other two new sublineages in Physisporinus, of which\none with a single collection, are still treated as generic level.\nCombined the morphological and phylogenetic evidence, 16 new\ncombinations in Bridgeoporus, Ceriporia, Flaviporus, Rigidoporus and\nPhysisporinus are proposed. Five new species, Physisporinus crataegi, P.\nlavendulus, P. subcrocatus, P. tibeticus and Rigidoporus submicroporus,\nare identified from China. Illustrated descriptions of the novel species\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99883","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99883.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99879.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99874.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99890.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99887","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99887.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99899","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99899.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99898","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99898.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99897.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 98","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99901.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99900.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99896.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99895.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99894.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99892.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99891.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99889.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99888","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99888.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99886","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99886.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99885","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99885.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99884.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99882","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99882.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99881","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99881.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99880","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99880.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99878","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99878.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99877","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99877.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99876","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99876.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99875","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99875.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99872.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99893.phy"}]}
