Recently, T. pseudoeucalypti has been described in Australia\nin 2010 severely affecting Eucalyptus hybrids (1). In Argentina, while\nsurveying clonal E. grandis x E. camaldulensis hybrids trials, symptoms\nresembling those described for T. pseudoeucalypti were observed in Entre\nRÃ­os province in September 2013. The symptoms observed in young leaves\nwere large yellow chlorotic spot and deformed leaves, whereas in older\nleaves were individual pale brown necrotic spot. Symptomatic leaves were\ncollected and put them in moist chambers to induce fructification and\nsporulation. A total of 30 conidia were measured in length and width.\nPure cultures were obtained according with Andjic et al. (2). The DNA\nextraction from three pure isolates (ERI5, ERI6 and ERI12) was performed\nusing a CTAB protocol (3). Three genomic regions ITS, EF-1Î± and\nÎ²-tubulin were amplified by using specific primers ITS-3 and ITS-4,\nEF1-728F and EF1-986R, Bt2a and Bt2b, respectively. Sequences obtained\nfrom isolates ERI5, ERI6 and ERI12 were deposited in GenBank (accessions\nKP006702, KP006705 and KP006708 for ITS, KP006701, KP006704, KP006707\nfor EF-1Î± and KP006700, KP006703 and KP006706 for Î²-tubulin,\nrespectively). Phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS, Ef-1Î± and\nÎ²tubulin dataset of closely related species from BLAST search was\nperformed by using PAUP Version 4.0b10 for neighbour-joining and maximum\nparsimony. The aligned dataset was deposited in TreeBASE (ID 16739). The\nconidia were pale brown, 0-1 septate and the conidial size was (31)\n37.5(43.7) Âµm long and (2) 2.6 (3.2) Âµm wide, which are a little\nlonger than those reported for T. pseudoeucalypti. The cultural\ncharacteristics of the three isolates on MEA were similar to those\ndescribed for T. pseudoeucalypti. Growth was slow reaching 10mm after 30\ndays on MEA at 25ÂºC with white mycelia in the upperside and dark color\nunderside. The phylogenetic analysis combining the three genomic regions\ngrouped these isolates with T. pseudoeucalypti in a well-supported clade\n(>90% bootstrap support). To our knowledge, this is the first report\nof T. pseudoeucalypti in Argentina, and represents the second report of\nthis pathogen outside of Australia, after Uruguay (4). This disease\nconstitutes a serious threat for development of cold tolerant Eucalyptus\nhybrids in Argentina. Further investigation is required to determine the\nextent of this disease in Argentinean forest plantations. Fortunately,\ndifferences in susceptibility have been observed in Eucalyptus hybrids\nfrom local source, which enable the selection of resistant\ngenotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"original","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti on Eucalyptus hybrids\nRerootings","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79933.phy"},{"tree_label":"original","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti on Eucalyptus hybrids\nRerootings","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79935.phy"},{"tree_label":"original","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti on Eucalyptus hybrids\nRerootings","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79936.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined Tree NJ","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti on Eucalyptus hybrids\ncombined NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79934.phy"}]}
