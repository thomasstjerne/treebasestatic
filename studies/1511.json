The species has been often\nconsidered to be conspecific with A. densum, but this taxonomic\nplacement still remains to be confirmed. Phylogenetic analyses based on\nmultiple molecular markers clearly distinguished A. sparsum from A.\ndensum. In addition, the Atlantic A. densum from Kerry, Ireland, was\nclearly separated from the North Pacific A. defectum from San Juan\nIsland, Washington. Comparative analyses of four DNA regions showed that\nthe rbcS region provided the most useful information with the highest\nresolution and statistical support among the four DNA regions studied.\nMolecular evidence strongly suggests that A. sparsum should be treated\nas an independent species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antithamnion sparsum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2403.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rubisco spacer","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antithamnion sparsum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2402.phy"}]}
