Porphyrospora. This mushroom is sold as an edible in markets of\nLaos under the local name “wai khom.” Hebeloma sect. Porphyrospora is\ndiscussed and expanded to include the species formerly included in the\ngenus Anamika and recently transferred to Hebeloma. Hebeloma sect.\nPorphyrospora currently comprises 16 species, 14 of which are known only\nfrom the western Pacific and Indian subcontinent. All species in this\nsection share the character of having red-brown spores when fresh,\natypical for other sections of Hebeloma, which causes the lamellae to be\nred-brown. However, this red-brown color fades when the material is\ndried. The close links, morphologically and molecularly, between H.\nparvisporum and other members of H. sect. Porphyrospora, particularly H.\nvictoriense, are shown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119389.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119392.phy"}]}
