Traditionally, T. dubius\nhas been considered a morphologically homogeneous species that includes\nall Tragopogon collections with yellow flowers and swollen peduncles\nunder capitula. Here we describe a new species of Tragopogon from the\nIberian Peninsula, T. lainzii, which has heretofore been included in T.\ndubius. To this end, we performed comparative morphological, cytogenetic\nand molecular analyses on many populations of both species. Our results\nshow that T. dubius is not a homogeneous species and that different\nlineages exist across its broad geographic distribution. Moreover, we\nshow that hybridization has occurred in the wild between sympatric\npopulations of T. dubius, T. lainzii, and T. porrifolius.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tragopogon lainzii, rpL16 bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7875.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tragopogon lainzii, ETS+ITS bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7874.phy"}]}
