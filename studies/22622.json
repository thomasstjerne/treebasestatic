To determine its taxonomic status and evolutionary\nrelationships, a phylogenetic analysis was performed on DNA sequences\nfrom nuclear loci, assessing both ribosomal RNA and protein coding\ngenes. Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood analyses based on the\n18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II\n(RPB2) gene sequences were used to estimate phylogenetic relationships.\nV. antarcticus constitutes one wellÂ–supported distinct lineage within the\nCephalothecaceae (family incertae sedis in Sordariomycetes), in which\nthe only recognised anamorphs belong to Acremonium and Phialemonium.\nVictoriomyces antarcticus can be clearly distinguished from these two\ngenera by means of a DNA sequence and morphological trait analysis. The\ntype strain of V. antarcticus is FBL 165T (MUT 3686 T); an additional\nstrain of the species is FBL 577. The MycoBank number is MB 823713 for\nthe genus and MB 823714 for the species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Victoriomyces antarcticus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112363.phy"}]}
