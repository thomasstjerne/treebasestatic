A total of 52 isolates were\ncharacterized by multi-locus sequence analysis of the internal\ntranscribed spacer region (ITS) and partial sequences of the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (TEF). According to morphological\ncharacteristics and analysis of multi-gene sequence data, 14 species in\nBotryosphaeriaceae belonging to five genera, viz. Botryosphaeria,\nDiplodia, Dothiorella, Eutiarosporella and Neofusicoccum were\nidentified, including Dothiorella italica sp. nov. The other known\nspecies isolated were Botryosphaeria dothidea, B. auasmontanum, Diplodia\nalatafructa, Di. crataegicola, Di. mutila, Di. sapinea, Di. seriata,\nDothiorella omnivora, Do. rhamni, Do. sarmentorum, Do. sempervirentis,\nEutiarosporella dactylidis and Neofusicoccum parvum. Of these,\nBotryosphaeria dothidea and Diplodia seriata were the most prevalent\nspecies among the isolates. Several new host-fungus relationships were\nestablished. This study indicates the fungal family Botryosphaeriaceae\nseems to be common and widespread on a broad range of hosts in\nItaly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107869.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eutiarosporella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107868.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107870.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107871.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107867.phy"}]}
