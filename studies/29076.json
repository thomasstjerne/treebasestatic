Yang, T.C. Wen sp. nov. from Guizhou Province, China.\nGanoderma ovasporum is characterized by annual, stipitate, laccate\nbasidiome, with red-brown to brownish-black pileus surface and pale\nwhite pore, duplex context, clavate pellis cells, trimitic hyphal\nsystem, ellipsoid basidiospores with a prominent wide rounded apex of\nexospore. The phylogenetic analyses of combined ITS + nLSU+ RPB2 genes\nconfirmed that the novel species sisters to G. sandunense with high\nsupport. Notably, we have re-examined the type specimen of Ganoderma\nsandunense and provided more clear morphology of duplex context, pellis\ncells and basidia. The RPB2 sequence of G. sandunense was supplied for\nthe first time in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134692.phy"}]}
