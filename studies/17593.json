Lagerheima\nsphaerospora (≡ Bulgariella sphaerospora, type species of the genus\nLagerheima) proves to be conspecific with Bulgariella pulla, holotype of\nBulgariella. Thus, Bulgariella remains as a monotypic genus. Asci of B.\npulla lack a pore and open by forming valves. This is an unusual feature\nin the Leotiomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of the 5.8S, large, and\nsmall subunit rDNA show that Bulgariella has an uncertain position\nwithin the Leotiomycetes, its placement under any of the families or\nclades of that order is yet to be defined.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102897.phy"}]}
