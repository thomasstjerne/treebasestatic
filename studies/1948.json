A clade of four hexaploid Lobelia species from Chile is\nsister to a clade comprising Lysipomia, Siphocampylus, Centropogon, and\nBurmeistera. Lysipomia is a monophyletic group of small cushion-forming\nplants endemic to the high Andes, and is sister to the clade comprising\nthe remaining three shrubby genera, which are most diverse in the Andes,\nbut also extend to Central America, Mexico, and the West Indies.\nSiphocampylus has capsular fruit and is inferred to be paraphyletic\nrelative to fleshy-fruited Centropogon and Burmeistera, but fleshy\nfruits have evidently evolved repeatedly, making Centropogon\npolyphyletic. Burmeistera is primarily bat-pollinated and monophyletic,\nhaving evolved from one group of species in Centropogon. The\nphylogenetic relationships within Burmeistera indicate that this genus\nunderwent repeated episodes of rapid diversification when organismal\ndiversification outpaced the accumulation of mutations in this region of\nchloroplast DNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Lobeliaceae preferred tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5011.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South America Lobeliaceae strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5012.phy"}]}
