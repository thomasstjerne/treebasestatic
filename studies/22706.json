Accurate morphological identification of\nindividual taxa of this family is rather difficult, as previous\nclassifications are confused. In this study, we determined the\nphylogenetic and morphological relationships of marine diatrypaceous\ntaxa. A novel genus Halocryptovalsa is established to accommodate\nHalocryptovalsa salicorniae sp. nov. and Halocryptovalsa avicenniae\ncomb. nov. Three novel species Diatrype mangrovei, Cryptosphaeria\navicenniae and Cryptosphaeria halophila are also introduced from\nmangroves. Halodiatrype is amended with asexual morph characters. This\nstudy provides a detailed account of all known marine diatrypaceous\nascomycetes using both morphological and phylogenetic data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111735.phy"}]}
