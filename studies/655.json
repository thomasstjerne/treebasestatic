Collybia tuberosa, C. cirrhata and C. cookei are morphologically\nsimilar and are primarily distinguished from each other by the presence\nor absence and the colour of sclerotia. All four share a common and\nunique habitat. Phylogenetic reconstructions using DNA sequences of the\nribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 support four distinct clades, each\ncorresponding to a morphological species, with the C. tuberosa, C.\ncirrhata and C. cookei clades forming a larger group. Analyses of\nribosomal Large Subunit DNA sequences confirmed that Collybia tuberosa,\nC. cirrhata and C. cookei formed a monophyletic group. In both analyses,\nthe C. racemosa sequence was highly divergent from those of the other\nthree species of the complex and we propose a separate genus name,\nDendrocollybia, for this species. Simple diagnostic RFLP patterns were\nidentified for the four species and were used to validate morphological\ndesignations and distributions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Collybia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3632.phy"}]}
