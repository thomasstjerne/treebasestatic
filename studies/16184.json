Morphological analysis. Waste water\ntreatment.","DOI":"","Abstract":" Phytopythium iriomotense sp. nov. was isolated from river\nwater of Iriomote Island, Okinawa prefecture, Japan. The species can\ngrow at 1035 ºC. The optimum temperature was 30 ºC with a radial growth\nof 24.3 mm per day. The species is morphologically characterized by\nglobose to sub-globose sporangia with apical papillae, internally nested\nand internally extended proliferating sporangia, lateral hyphal\nswellings, compound sympodia, globose and smooth oogonia, amphigynous or\ncrook-necked antheridial cells, oogonia with double oospores, aplerotic\nor plerotic oospores, and a chrysanthemum growth pattern on V8A.\nPhytopythium aichiense sp. nov. was isolated from water purification\nsludge in Aichi prefecture, Japan. The species can grow at 335 ºC. The\noptimum temperature was 28 ºC with a radial growth of 12.3 mm per day.\nP. aichiense is morphologically characterized by sub-globose, ovoid or\nlimoniform sporangia with apical papillae, internally nested or\ninternally extended proliferating sporangia, filamentous inflated or\ncrook-necked antheridial cells, aplerotic oospores and a stellate growth\npattern on V8A. Phylogenetic analyses based on the rDNA ITS region and\ncombined phylogenetic trees based on the nuclear LSU rDNA and\nbeta-tubulin gene, and the mitochondrial coxI and coxII genes revealed\nthat both species are genetically distinct from each other and from\nmorphologically related species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76736.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78394.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78395.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78398.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML coxI tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78397.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined ML tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78401.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML Tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78402.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76745","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76745.phy"}]}
