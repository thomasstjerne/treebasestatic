Nirenberg but\ndescribed as unable to produce fumonisin. Here we report biochemical and\nmorphological evidence, as well as multilocus phylogenetic analyses\nbased on elongation factor (EF-1a), calmodulin, b-tubulin, and the\nsecond largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) sequences, indicating\nthat these isolates represent a unique lineage in the Gibberella\nfujikuroi species complex related to but distinct from F.\nverticillioides. Together with previous results of molecular studies, as\nwell as with results of metabolite analyses, crossing experiments,\npathogenicity tests and morphological characterization, these new data\nindicate that these strains isolated from banana represent a new\nspecies, Gibberella musae Van Hove et al. sp. nov. (anamorph: Fusarium\nmusae Van Hove et al. sp. nov.), which is described herein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium musae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46260.phy"}]}
