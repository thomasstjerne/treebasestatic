Here we characterize the endophytes of the European\nwoodland grass Hordelymus europaeus based on growth characteristics,\nmorphology of conidiophores and conidia, and phylogenetic relationships.\nOf the six different taxa found on H. europaeus, four are new, for which\nwe propose the species names E. hordelymi, E. disjuncta, E. danica and\nsubspecies E. sylvatica subsp. pollinensis. The other two are assigned\nto previously described E. bromicola and E. sylvatica. E. hordelymi, E.\ndisjuncta and E. danica are asexual interspecific hybrids, while the\nother taxa are haploid. Only E. sylvatica subsp. pollinensis was found\nto reproduce sexually on H. europaeus. The high diversity of endophytes\nmay be explained by repeated host jumps to H. europaeus with and without\nsubsequent interspecific hybridizations","trees":[{"tree_label":"con","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe endophytes on Hordelymus europaeus tef","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61841.phy"},{"tree_label":"tub","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe endophytes on Hordelymus europaeus tub","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61842.phy"}]}
