The data set comprises the complete sequencing of the D3\ndivergent domain of the nuclear gene that codes for the 25S large\nsubunit of ribosomal RNA. The parsimony analyses corroborates the\ningroup monophyly (Hymenochaetales), the sister group relationship\nbetween Hymenochaetales and Trichaptum, and the polyphyletism of\nPhellinus and the Phellinus rimosus species complex. These findings\nsuggest that incrusted hymenial cystidia (Trichaptum) and hymenial setae\n(Hymenochaetales) are homologous structures. The presence of many short\nbranches in the phylogeny is presumed to be related to cladogenetic\nevents separated by short periods of time. Thus the large number of\ncurrent tropical species of Phellinus sensu lato may be of recent\norigin.
