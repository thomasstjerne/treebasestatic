Pollen analysis shows that the new genus Karima belongs to the\ninaperturate crotonoid group. Analysis of a concatenated dataset\ncombining trnL-F and part of rbcL, positioned the genus Neoholstia from\nsouth eastern tropical Africa as sister to Karima in a well supported\nclade comprised of genera of subtribes Grosserineae and Neoboutonieae in\nsubclade C2 of the inaperturate crotonoid genera. Several morphological\ncharacters support the relationship of Karima with Neoholstia, yet\nseparation is merited by numerous characters usually associated with\ngeneric rank in Euphorbiaceae.
