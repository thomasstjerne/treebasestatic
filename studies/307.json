It\nis characterized by long chains of microconidia which can be either\npyriform or fusiform and are produced on polyphialides. Perithecia were\nnot obtained in mating experiments. A strongly supported F. miscanthi-F.\nnisikadoi clade forms a putative sister-group to the Fusarium oxysporum\ncomplex. These two clades form a strongly supported sister-group to the\nGibberella fujikuroi complex. Introduction of F. miscanthi into Denmark\nfrom Asia together with the grass seems plausible.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1436.phy"}]}
