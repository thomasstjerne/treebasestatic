Phylogenetic analyses based on the\nnuclear gene H3 and the mitochondrial genes COI and 16S using MrBayes\nand Maximum Likelihood analyses show that Ophryotrocha eutrophila sp.\nnov. is a close relative to Ophryotrocha puerilis, while Ophryotrocha\ncraigsmithi sp. nov. falls together with Palpiphitime lobifera, and\nOphryotrocha scutellus sp. nov. occur within the ‘hartmanni’ clade. The\ngenus Ophryotrocha is in our study monophyletic only if the genera\nIphitime and Palpiphitime are included. Two representatives of\nOphryotrocha previously described from antropogenically enriched\nsediments are here reported for the first time in very high abundance\nfrom a natural habitat. We suggest that whale falls are important\nhabitats for the evolution of ecosystem services such as degrading of\ncomplex organocarbon compounds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophryotrocha combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6015.phy"}]}
