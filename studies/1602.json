Within the group, trees,\nshrubs, herbs, vines, and lianas are present. Using ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2\nsequence data, a phylogeny of 67 of ~100 species of Adenia is inferred\nusing parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Specific hypotheses of monophyly\nare also tested to couch the analyses of growth form evolution within a\nphylogenetic framework. Within the context of this phylogeny,\nsynapomorphies for major clades are discussed, as are patterns of growth\nform evolution. Absolute divergence times of nodes are estimated using\npenalized likelihood, and speciation rate based on these times is\ninferred to be fast relative to some other lineages of life. By\nreconstructing evolutionary history on a sample of trees from the\nposterior distribution of the Bayesian analysis, it is estimated that\nsucculent stems evolved ca. three times, and tubers ca. seven.\nTransitions between markedly different growth forms occur on the scale\nof a few hundred thousand to a few million years, and close relatives\nfrequently have different forms with no intermediates. The rapid\ndiversification rates, fast morphological transitions, and multiple\norigins of water storage tissue in roots and shoots are hypothesized to\nresult from a shared developmental program for water storage tissue is\nflexibly turned on and off in stems and roots.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 MP MR","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adaptive radiation of Adenia, MajRule MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_699.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 MP Str","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adaptive radiation of Adenia, Strict MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 MR boot","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adaptive radiation of Adenia, MajRule btsrp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_701.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 Str boot","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adaptive radiation of Adenia, Strict btsrp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_702.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 MB","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adaptive radiation of Adenia, contree all compat\nbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_703.phy"}]}
