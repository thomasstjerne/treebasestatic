Recent studies and\nmolecular data reveal that members of the Thelephoraceae are common\nectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the Dipterocarpaceae. The\nsuspected Thelephoroid fungus FP160 was isolated from ectomycorrhizal\nroots of a Shorea parvifolia (Dipterocarpaceae) seedling and kept in the\nFRIM culture collection. In subsequent inoculation experiments it was\nable to form morphologically similar ectomycorrhizas with seedlings of\ntwo other dipterocarps, namely Hopea odorata and S. leprosula, and the\nexotic fast-growing legume, Acacia mangium. Therefore, there is a need\nto identify this fungus for further studies on its possible utilization\nin inoculation and planting programmes and also to expand our limited\nknowledge of Malaysian mycodiversity. In this paper the morphological\ncharacteristics of the ectomycorrhizas formed by FP160 with H. odorata\nand A. mangium are described and the fungus identified using molecular\nmethods as a member of the genus Tomentella, family Thelephoraceae. It\nwas not possible to identify the fungus to the species level due to the\nlimited number of sequences available for tropical Thelephoraceae in the\npublic databases.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ectomycorrhizal Thelephoroid Fungus of Malaysian\nDipterocarps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20094.phy"}]}
