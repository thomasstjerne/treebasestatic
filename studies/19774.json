The Japanese Kitamagotake specimens wereare\nmorphologically distinguisheddistinct from the Southeast Asian A.\njavanica sensu stricto. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), andregion, 28S large subunit (LSU) regions of\nnuclear ribosomal RNA, and translation elongation factor 1 (tef-1) genes\nshowed that the Kitamagotake clade wasis independent and distant from A.\njavanica. Therefore, we described here Kitamagotake as a new species,\nAmanita kitamagotake sp. nov. Interestingly, the Japanese yellow-cap\nCaesars mushrooms contained yellow-color variant specimens variants of\nA. caesareoides (, which are normally red-cap), and A. aff. similis (,\nwhich are normally olive-brown-cap),, both of which could lead to\nmisidentification as A. kitamagotake. Especially,The original specimen\nof Japanese A. javanica in particular did not correspond morphologically\nto A. kitamagotake but was decided asdetermined to be the yellow-color\nvariant of A. aff. similis. These results strongly suggestpoint to the\nimportance of precise morphological observation and molecular analysis\nfor the species identification of species of yellow-cap Caesars\nmushrooms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98444","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98444.phy"}]}
