Three of the new\nspecies no longer produced sporulating structures in culture and two of\nthese were morphologically described from voucher specimens.\nPhylogenetic relationships of the new species with other Diaporthe\nspecies are revealed by DNA sequence analyses based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region, and partial regions of the beta-tubulin\n(BT) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ITS 1 ML2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58127.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58128.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ITS NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63720.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ITS TEF BT combined NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63721.phy"}]}
