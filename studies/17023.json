To assess the distribution of\nLysobacter spp. displaying lytic enzyme activities in tropical\nenvironments, samples were collected from grass-covered soils in\nThailand. Isolation was based on an enrichment-culture broth\nsupplemented with colloidal shrimp chitin and selective antimicrobials.\nMorphological observation and physiological tests, along with 16S rRNA\nsequence analysis, were used to confirm the so-obtained primary\nidentification. Among 44 chitinolytic bacteria isolated, strain 521\n(accession no. NCCB 100553) was identified as Lysobacter enzymogenes.\nZymogram analysis was used to characterize bifunctional\ncarboxymethylcellulase (CMCase)-chitosanase activity in the crude CMCase\nfrom L. enzymogenes 521. The CMCase nucleotide and the predicted amino\nacid sequences derived from the draft genome sequencing were deduced.\nPhylogenetic analysis of CMCase gene and multiple alignment of the\ndeduced amino acid sequence illustrated that the CMCase (Cel8A) from L.\nenzymogenes 521 displayed homology to the Family 8 glycoside hydrolases\n(GHF-8), and was found to be similar to the bifunctional endoglucanase\n(Cel8A) from Lysobacter sp. IB-9374 (98.3%) and to the ÔÅ¢-1,4-glucanase\nfrom L. capsici AZ78 (78.1%). This is the first description of a\ntropical strain of L. enzymogenes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16s rRNA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85880.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GHF-8","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_81381.phy"}]}
