Here, we provide a revision\nof the genus in Argentina, with an identification key, comments, a\ndistribution map, and images of all species. The phylogenetic position\nof all species has been assessed using chloroplast and nuclear DNA\nsequences. We recognize six species. Besides R. altissima and R.\nmacrophylla, we include two new records, R. hilariana and R.\nbrasiliensis, and propose two new combinations in the genus, R.\ncastillonii (Lillo ex T. Mey.) H.A. Keller & Liede and R.\ntressensiae (S.A. Cáceres & Morillo) H.A. Keller & Liede.\nRuehssia montana and R. ulei, previously reported to Argentina, do not\noccur in the country.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruehssia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130694.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruehssia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130693.phy"}]}
