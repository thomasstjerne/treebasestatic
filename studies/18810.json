It is typified by N.\nxanthochrous sp. nov., characterized by its resupinate basidiocarps with\ndarkening reaction in KOH, a monomtic hyphal system with simple septa\nand hyaline to yellowish generative hyphae, and hyaline, and\nthin-walled, cylindric to oblong-ellipsoid basidiospores. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of N. xanthochrous and its related species was inferred from\nITS and nLSU rDNA sequences, which indicates that it belongs to\nPhanerochaetaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Niveofulviporus MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110248.phy"}]}
