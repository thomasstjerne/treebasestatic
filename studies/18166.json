Traditional\ntaxonomy can be complemented and accelerated using molecular methods of\nspecies delimitation, such as the widely used Generalised Mixed\nYule-Coalescent (GMYC) approach. This method uses time-calibrated\nphylogenetic trees in order to identify transition points between inter-\nand intraspecific divergence processes. Despite some important\nlimitations, the GMYC approach appears to be robust to a wide range of\ndataset characteristics. It is one of the few model-based\nspecies-delimitation methods that remains practical for analysing\ndatasets with large numbers of taxa. Most GMYC analyses have been based\non datasets consisting of one or a small number of mitochondrial genes.\nTo investigate the sensitivity of GMYC to the choice of mitochondrial\nmarker, we compared GMYC estimates from 15 mitochondrial genes for three\nvertebrate datasets (cetaceans, ursids, and whitefish). Despite the\nexpectation that different markers would generate highly similar or\nidentical species delimitations, we found substantial variation across\nthe estimates from different markers across all three datasets. This\nvariability was not restricted to specific genes or taxa, and extended\nto commonly used barcoding genes such as COI and CYTB. Using multiple\nconcatenated markers mitigated these problems in some datasets, but also\nexacerbated systematic biases present in others. Our findings indicate\nthe need for careful consideration when choosing markers for molecular\nspecies delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cetacea COI RaxML
