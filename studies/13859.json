There has been much speculation about their age, but\nprogress in dating cactus origins has been hindered by the lack of\nfossil data for cacti or their close relatives. Using a hybrid\nphylogenomic approach, we estimated that the cactus lineage diverged\nfrom its closest relatives ≈35 million years ago (Ma). However, major\ndiversification events in cacti were more recent, with most species-rich\nclades originating in the late Miocene, ≈105 Ma. Diversification rates\nof several cactus lineages rival other estimates of extremely rapid\nspeciation in plants. Major cactus radiations were contemporaneous with\nthose of South African ice plants and North American agaves, revealing a\nsimultaneous diversification of several of the world’s major succulent\nplant lineages across multiple continents. This short geological time\nperiod also harbored the majority of origins of C4 photosynthesis and\nthe global rise of C4 grasslands. A global expansion of arid\nenvironments during this time could have provided new ecological\nopportunity for both succulent and C4 plant syndromes. Alternatively,\nrecent work has identified a substantial decline in atmospheric CO2 ≈158\nMa, which would have strongly favored C4 evolution and expansion of\nC4-dominated grasslands. Lowered atmospheric CO2 would also\nsubstantially exacerbate plant water stress in marginally arid\nenvironments, providing preadapted succulent plants with a sharp\nadvantage in a broader set of ecological conditions and promoting their\nrapid diversification across the landscape.","trees":[{"tree_label":"oldest node","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angiosperm oldest node ages","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60952.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dated","ntax":"289","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60954","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60954.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"295","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60955","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60955.phy"},{"tree_label":"Angiosperms","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angiosperms 102 taxa 83 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60951.phy"},{"tree_label":"youngest node","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angiosperm youngest node ages","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60953.phy"}]}
