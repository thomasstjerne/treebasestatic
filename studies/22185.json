Understanding the mechanisms driving geographic range\nsizes of species is a central issue in ecology, but remarkably few rules\nlink physiology with the distributions of species. Maximal metabolic\nrate (MMR) during exercise is an important measure of physiological\nperformance. It sets an upper limit to sustained activity and locomotor\ncapacity, so MMR may influence ability to migrate, disperse, and\nmaintain population connectivity. Using both conventional ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) analyses and phylogenetically generalized least squares\n(PGLS), we tested whether MMR helps explain geographic range size in 51\nspecies of placental mammals.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bayes_cytb-ultrametric","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109677","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109677.phy"},{"tree_label":"bayes_cytb-ultrametric","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109682","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109682.phy"}]}
