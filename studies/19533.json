The genus is\nconfirmed as monophyletic within the Alectorioid clade of Parmeliaceae.\nTwo major clades were recovered, which can be assigned to the two\ntraditional taxa, P. minuscula and P. pubescens, with modifications of\nthe species delimitations, especially the very variable P. minuscula.\nThese species are cryptic and cannot be confidently distinguished\nmorphologically due to phenotypic convergence, and the use of P.\npubescens aggr. is recommended for non-molecularly analyzed samples.\nContrary to previous studies, specimens of both species may have\nindistinct pseudocyphellae and also contain lichen substances;\nnorstictic acid was detected in c.Â 60 % of specimens tested. An SSU 1516\nGroup I intron is usually present in P. minuscula but always absent in\nP. pubescens. The species-level nomenclature is summarized and sequenced\nreference specimens (RefSpec) for both Pseudephebe species are selected.\nSequences from Bryoria mariensis established that this name was a\nsynonym of P. minuscula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudephebe RPB1 ITS MCM7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97126.phy"}]}
