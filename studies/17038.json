Public domain sequences of protein coding\ngenes of isolates from countries in different continents were used as a\nresource to evaluate its genetic diversity. Single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) detected in public sequences of the actin and\npartial Î²-tubulin genes were used to assess the genetic variability and\nto determine haplotypes of geographic isolates of this species. The\nItalian population showed the highest allele number and the highest\nnumber of haplotypes. Most haplotypes were present in more than one\ncountry, except for haplotype 11010 which was found only in Italy and\n10111 found only in Canada. Haplotype 11111 was the most conspicuous and\ncosmopolitan, being present in six countries and three plant species.\nOne observed polymorphisms in the non-coding region of the Î²-tubulin\ngene could be targeted with allele-specific primers to detect this\nparticular haplotype.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81405.phy"}]}
