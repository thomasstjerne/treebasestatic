A Penicillium species was found growing\nwith the epithelial cells in some culture flasks. It was\nmonoverticillate and somewhat resembled P. restrictum but differed\nmorphologically from this and all other Penicillium species. Two strains\nof this fungus were isolated in pure culture and described as the new\nspecies Penicillium pimiteouiense. We assayed the new species for\nochratoxin A production because various Penicillium and Aspergillus\nspecies are known to produce this potent nephrotoxin, and the new\nspecies was isolated only from diseased kidney cell cultures. Ochratoxin\nA production was not detected in P. pimiteouiense. The role this fungus\nplays in polycystic kidney disease is unknown, but it has only be found\nassociated with human PKD kidney tissue cultures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium Furcatum and Aspergilloides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3256.phy"}]}
