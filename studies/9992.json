Sequence analysis of the ITS rDNA was performed to reveal\nphylogenetic relationships of the Peronospora specimens from five\nspecies of Chenopodium, viz.Â C. album, C. ambrosioides, C.\nbonus-henricus, C. hybridum, and C. polyspermum. Five independent clades\nwere grouped towards specific Chenopodium species using Bayesian\ninference and maximum parsimony, and shared a high level of sequence\ndistances. The dissimilarities in the morphologies of their conidia and\nultimate branchlets also supported the separation of the five groups on\nthe species level. These results proposed that the names, P. variabilis.\nP. boni-henrici, P. chenopodii, and P. chenopodii-polyspermi, be\nmaintained for the four downy mildew pathogens specific to C. album, C.\nbonus-henricus, C. hybridum, and C. polyspermum, respectively. A\nPeronospora species parasitic on C. ambrosioides was also found to be an\nindependent species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6047.phy"}]}
