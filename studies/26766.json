Through the Cape Citizen Science programme, several\nsurveys were conducted between 2014-2019. One of the aims for these\nsurveys was to catalogue the diversity of Phytophthora species\nassociated with the endemic plants. Using soil and water baiting\ntechniques, we recovered several isolates of already described\nPhytophthora species along with six isolates of Phytophthora taxon\nemzansi and three isolates of an undescribed sterile\nPhytophthora species. In this study, we used multi-gene phylogeny and\nmicroscopy to describe these species. All isolates of P. emzansi sp.\nnov. and P. afrocarpa sp. nov. formed monophyletic lineages within the\nITS Clade 2 and 10 respectively. Additionally, we also reconstructed the\nevolution of sexuality among Phytophthora ITS Clade 10 species. This\nanalysis showed homothallism as the ancestral reproductive state for ITS\nClade 10 species. Heterothallism and sexual sterility are outcomes of\nrecent switches in the mating system. The unique biology of the\nPhytophthora species described in this study allows them to thrive in\nthe exclusive fynbos vegetation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125336.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125335","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125337","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125337.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125323.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125322.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125327.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125328.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125329","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125329.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125333","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125333.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125334.phy"}]}
