The new variety is\nmorphologically characterized by its orange, depressed to umbilicated\npileus, conspicuous sclerobasidia, flexuous-cylindrical pseudocystidia,\nand a smooth cutis pileipellis. Phylogenetic analysis of molecular data\n(nrITS, nrLSU) and pairwise dissimilarities provides support for the\nrecognition of cryptic lineages within R. mellea co-occurring in the\nNeotropics. We also discuss the position of nrITS sequences of some\nsclerotium-forming fungi collected in the same area and evidence the\ngenus Rhodocybe as a producer of this survival structure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134686","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134686.phy"}]}
