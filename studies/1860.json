The latest taxonomic\naccounts of the family left it either unplaced within subfamily\nAsteroideae or unplaced within tribe Inuleae. Macro-morphological and\nelectron microscopy data (Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission\nelectron microscopy) indicated that Feddea is not part of an early\nbranching lineages of the Asteraceae, contrary to what had been\nsuggested in initial taxonomic accounts. Feddea has style branches with\na 2-banded (vs.Â continuous) stigmatic surface, thus differing from early\ndiverging lineages of the family. Among Asteroideae, Feddea is diagnosed\nby discoid capitula with all florets bisexual, long-caudate anthers,\nnon-carbonized cypselae, and pollen with a narrow cavus region,\ncolumellae without internal foramina, but with a complex basal\ncolumellate layer. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on nucleotide\nsequences of the chloroplast gene ndhF showed that Feddea is sister to\nthe Heliantheae s.l. There were, however, no clear morphological\nsynapomorphies shared with that tribe and we therefore propose Feddeeae\nas a new unispecific tribe to accommodate this critically endangered\ngenus restricted to Eastern Cuba.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Feddea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1001.phy"}]}
