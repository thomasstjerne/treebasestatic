Strongly supported monophyletic clades\nsustain several of the target taxa as distinct species (S. reflexum, S.\nstarkii, S. tromsoeense Draper & Hedenäs comb. nov., S. glaciale, S.\ndovrense Draper & Hedenäs comb. nov. and S. latifolium), but the\nsegregation of two of the taxa under study (S. nelsonii and\nBrachythecium glaciale var. gelidum) is found to be inconsistent with\nour results and they are therefore synonymized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sciuro-hypnum reflexum Complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5200.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sciuro-hypnum reflexum Complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5199.phy"}]}
