In recent years, DNA-based studies revealed\nmultiple non-monophyletic genera within the Alternaria complex, and\nAlternaria species clades that do not always correlate to species-groups\nbased on morphological characteristics. The Alternaria complex currently\ncomprises nine genera and eight Alternaria sections. The aim of this\nstudy was to delineate phylogenetic lineages within Alternaria and\nallied genera based on nucleotide sequence data of parts of the 18S\nnrDNA, 28S nrDNA, ITS, GAPDH, RPB2 and TEF1-alpha gene regions. Our data\nreveal a Pleospora/Stemphylium clade sister to Embellisia annulata, and\na well-supported Alternaria clade. The Alternaria clade contains 24\ninternal clades and six monotypic lineages, the assemblage of which we\nrecognise as Alternaria. This puts the genera Allewia, Brachycladium,\nChalastospora, Chmelia, Crivellia, Embellisia, Lewia, Nimbya, Sinomyces,\nTeretispora, Ulocladium, Undifilum and Ybotromyces in synonymy with\nAlternaria. In this study, we treat the 24 internal clades in the\nAlternaria complex as sections, which is a continuation of a recent\nproposal for the taxonomic treatment of lineages in Alternaria.\nEmbellisia annulata is synonymised with Dendryphiella salina, and\ntogether with Dendryphiella arenariae, are placed in the new genus\nParadendryphiella. The sexual genera Clathrospora and Comoclathris,\nwhich were previously associated with Alternaria, cluster within the\nPleosporaceae, outside Alternaria s. str., whereas Alternariaster, a\ngenus formerly seen as part of Alternaria, clusters within the\nLeptosphaeriaceae. Paradendryphiella is newly described, the generic\ncircumscription of Alternaria is emended, and 32 new combinations and 10\nnew names are proposed. A further 10 names are resurrected, while\ndescriptions are provided for 16 new Alternaria sections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"SSU con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64048","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64048.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64049","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64049.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHRPB2TEF1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64026","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64026.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHRPB2TEF1 RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64027","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64027.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHRPB2 con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64028","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64028.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHRPB2 RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64029","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64029.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDH con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64032","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64032.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHTEF1 RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64031","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64031.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDHTEF1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64030","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64030.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDH RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64033","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64033.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2TEF1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64040.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2TEF1 RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64041.phy"},{"tree_label":"All con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64042","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64042.phy"},{"tree_label":"All RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64043.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64044.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF1 RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64045.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64034.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS RAxML 500 bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64035.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64036.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU RAxML 500 boostrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64037.phy"},{"tree_label":"RBP2 con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64038.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 RAxML bootstrap","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64039.phy"}]}
