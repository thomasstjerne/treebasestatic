The aim\nof the present study was to identify the pathogen that causes Fusarium\nwilt in common bean through morphological and molecular\ncharacterization, and pathogenicity studies in Fusarium isolates (UFV01,\nIACs 18001, 18002, 18003, 19009, 19014, and 19015) obtained from\nsymptomatic plants in different common bean producing regions.\nMorphocultural characterization was carried out in PDA and SNA medium by\nevaluation of the color of the colony, the size and shape of the\nconidia, and conidiogenic cell type. Molecular characterization was\nconducted through construction of the phylogenetic tree with sequences\nof the partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1α),\nbeta-tubulin (TUB2), RNA polymerase II and calmodulin (CAL). Based on\nthe results obtained in this study, we conclude that the isolates\ncollected in different regions of Brazil in different periods were\nidentified as belonging to the species Fusarium nirenbergiae, F.\nfabacearum and two or others???  Ricardo: ajudar aqui !!!! unidentified\nand possibly new species of Fusarium, according to Genealogical\nConcordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition criteria. The\nrepresentative isolates of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli are most\naggressive and comprised a monophyletic group separated from previously\nreported Fusarium oxysporum complex.
