Characterization based on morphological, physiological\nand molecular data from translation elongation factor (EF-1α), 28S\n(D1/D2) and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences was conducted. The isolates\nproduce lateral branches bearing multispored sporangiola in addition to\nthe multispored sporangia and a uniformly septate mycelium as the main\ndifferentiating characteristics. Surprisingly, this fungus possesses two\nEF-1α genes which were 1.4 and 1.5 kb in length. Evidence from the\nanalysed datasets supports the delimitation of a new genus","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47536.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47537.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47538.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47539","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47539.phy"}]}
