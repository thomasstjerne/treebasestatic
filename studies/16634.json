This is an extraordinarily deep\nhybridization event, roughly akin to an elephant hybridizing with a\nmanatee, or a human with a lemur. In the context of other reported deep\nhybrids, this finding suggests that populations of ferns, and other\nplants with abiotically mediated fertilization, may evolve reproductive\nincompatibilities more slowly, perhaps because they lack many of the\npremating isolation mechanisms that characterize most other groups of\norganisms. This conclusion implies that major features of Earths\nbiodiversitysuch as the relatively small number of species of ferns\ncompared to those of angiospermsmay be, in part, an indirect byproduct\nof this slower “speciation clock,” rather than a direct consequence of\nadaptive innovations by the more diverse lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystopteridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79463.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystopteridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79464.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystopteridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79462.phy"}]}
