Based on morphological similarities of the fruitbodies\nincluding white to cream ascomata with chambered gleba (solid\nptychothecium), ornamented ascospores and cylindrical paraphyses, the\nfungus seems closely related to Reddellomyces parvulosporus, R.\nwestraliensis and R. donkii species, while distinguishable on the basis\nof ascospores dimension and paraphyses size. Further analysis based on\nthe nuclear LSU and ITS1, 5,8S and ITS2 rDNA sequences showed its unique\nidentity within Reddellomyces assemblage. Combination of molecular data\nand morphological characteristics of these organisms warrant distinction\nof a novel species within the genus Reddellomyces for which the name\nReddellomyces acaciae sp. nov. is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of the new species using internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS) rRNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_102311.phy"}]}
