The closest species based on morphological characters,\naccording to Boartmann (2008) and Boccardo et al. (2008), is H.\ncalyptriformis, however, it differs from H. rodomaculata by the pointed\numbo, absence of yellow colour of the stipe and is non-radicate. In\naddition, H. calyptriformis belongs to the section Microspore whose\ndistinctive feature is spore dimensions below 9 µm while H. rodomaculata\nexceeds this size. The closest species determined by DNA sequence\nanalysis was H. reidii, which is distinguished mainly by not having\numbo, by the slightly felted, scaly and uniform coloration, gills more\nor less decurrent, a proportionally shorter stipe, slightly smaller\nbasidiospores, and characteristic honey odour.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hygrocybe rodomaculata MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_116772.phy"}]}
