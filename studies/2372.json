Most Cucurbitales have unisexual flowers, and species are\nmonoecious, dioecious, andromonoecious or androdioecious. To resolve\ninterfamilial relationships within the order and to polarize\nmorphological character evolution, especially of flower sexual systems,\nwe sequenced nine plastid (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL, the trnL-F region,\nand the rpl20-rps12 spacer), nuclear (18S and 26S rDNA), and\nmitochondrial (nad1 b/c intron) genes (together ~12,000 bp) of 26\nrepresentatives of the seven families plus eight outgroup taxa from six\nother orders of the Eurosids I. Cucurbitales are strongly supported as\nmonophyletic and are closest to Fagales, albeit with moderate support;\nboth together are sister to Rosales. The deepest split in the\nCucurbitales is that between the Anisophylleaceae and the remaining\nfamilies; next is a clade of Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae, followed\nby Cucurbitaceae, which are sister to a clade of Begoniaceae,\nDatiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae. Based on this topology, stipulate\nleaves, inferior ovaries, parietal placentation, and one-seeded fruits\nare inferred as ancestral in Cucurbitales; exstipulate leaves, superior\novaries, apical placentation, and many-seeded fruits evolved within the\norder. Bisexual flowers are reconstructed as ancestral, but dioecy\nappears to have evolved already in the common ancestor of Begoniaceae,\nCucurbitaceae, Datiscaceae, and Tetramelaceae, and then to have been\nlost repeatedly in Begoniaceae and Cucurbitaceae. Both instances of\nandrodioecy (Datisca glomerata and Schizopepon bryoniifolius) evolved\nfrom dioecious ancestors, corroborating recent hypotheses about\nandrodioecy often evolving from dioecy.
