For these collections, intra-individual\nhaplotype divergence is typically less than 2%, but for 3% of these\ncollections, intra-individual haplotype divergence exceeds that figure.\nWe hypothesize that high intra-individual haplotype divergence is due to\nhybridization between agaric fungi with divergent haplotypes, possibly\nmigrants from geographically isolated glacial refugia. Four species with\nrelatively high haplotype divergence were examined: Armillaria mellea,\nAmanita citrina f. lavendula, Gymnopus dichrous and the Hygrocybe\nflavescens/chlorophana complex. The ITS region was sequenced, haplotypes\nof heterozygotes were resolved through cloning, and phylogenetic\nanalyses were used to determine the outcome of hybridization events.\nWithin Armillaria mellea and Amanita citrina f. lavendula, we found\nevidence of interbreeding and recombination. Within G. dichrous and H.\nflavescens/ chlorophana, hybrids were identified but there was no\nevidence for F2 or higher progeny in natural populations suggesting that\nthe hybrid fruitbodies may be an evolutionary dead end and that the\ngenetically divergent Mendelian populations from which they were derived\nare, in fact, different species. The association between levels of ITS\nhaplotype divergence of less than 5% (Armillaria mellea = 2.6% excluding\ngaps; Amanita citrina f. lavendula = 3.3%) with the presence of putative\nrecombinants and greater than 5% (Gymnopus dichrous=5.7%; Hygrocybe\nflavescens/chlorophana=14.1%) with apparent failure of F1 hybrids to\nproduce F2 or higher progeny in populations may suggest a correlation\nbetween genetic distance and reproductive isolation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopus dichrous","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63489.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria mellea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63490.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hygrocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63491.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita lavendula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63488.phy"}]}
