Yellow midrib symptoms were found in\nsugarcane in Thailand, too. Leaves with yellow midrib symptoms were\ncollected in plantations in Northeast, Southeast and Central Thailand\nand tested for phytoplasma. The symptomatic leaves and often also\nnon-symptomatic, green leaves of sugarcane from all three regions\ncontained phytoplasma of the Sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma type,\nwhich is a member of the Rice yellow dwarf group. No Western-X disease\nphytoplasma was found in the samples. It is concluded that yellow midrib\nsymptoms in Thailand sugarcane are not caused by the Leaf yellows\nphytoplasma, but are an early symptomatic stage of White leaf\nphytoplasma. White leaf phytoplasma is not only confined to the\nNortheast of Thailand from where it had been previously reported, but is\nalso prevalent in the other sugarcane regions in Thailand, which calls\nfor a simple, rigorous identification of infected seed cane to eradicate\nthe disease.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 8","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64245.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 9","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64246.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 10","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64247.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 11","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64248.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 12","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64249.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64239","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64239.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64240","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64241","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64242","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64242.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 6","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64243","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64243.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 7","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64244","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64244.phy"}]}
