Invasive\nProsopis species have been the target of a biological control programme\nin South Africa since 1985. During a survey for potential fungal\nbiological control agents in Mexico and Texas in 2001, a pod disease was\nrecorded on Prosopis glandulosa in both countries. The disease is\ncharacterized by black/grey pycnidia, flattening of the pods, and seed\ndecay. Morphological investigations of the causal organism showed it to\nbe a Coniothyrium-like coelomycete. However, based on conidiogenous cell\nmorphology and proliferation, we concluded that the organism is not\ncongeneric with Coniothyrium s. str. Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU\ngene placed this fungus in the Diaporthales. Parsimony analysis of the\nITS region (ITS-1, 5.8S, ITS-2) revealed it to group closely to\nCryphonectria and Endothia. Consequently, a new genus, Prosopidicola,\nwith type species Prosopidicola mexicana, is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"One of two most parsimonious trees obtained from ITS\ndata.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1910.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ tree obtained using the K2P substitution model on\nSSU sequence data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1909.phy"}]}
