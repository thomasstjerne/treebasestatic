Nucleotide sequence data from\nthree chloroplast genes (psbA, rpoC1 and rps4) were assembled for 41\naccessions of Cleveaceae (ingroup) and 6 accessions representing 6\nspecies from the family Aytoniaceae (outgroup), to construct the first\nmolecular phylogeny for the family. Traditionally three genera\n(Athalamia, Peltolepis and Sauteria) have been recognized in Cleveaceae\nbut analyses of the molecular data support the recognition of four\ngenera. Peltolepis and Sauteria are supported as previously defined but\nAthalamia is resolved as polyphyletic and the genus Clevea is therefore\nsegregated from it and a narrower Athalamia distinguished from it. The\ntraditional definition of genera of Cleveaceae largely by two characters\n(carpocephalum stalk position and anatomy) is rejected and morphological\ncharacters defining the genera are re-assessed. From this a revised\ngeneric delimitation is presented, including a key. Evolution of the\ngenera of Cleveaceae is re-evaluated in the light of molecular results\nand the misleading influence of homoplasy on past phylogenies is\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21381.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21380.phy"}]}
