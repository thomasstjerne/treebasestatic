Cladistic\nanalyses based on 71 out-group-polarized characters provided strong\nevidence for monophyly of centrosperms but only weak support for close\nsister-group status with Plumbaginaceae and Polygonaceae. Both phenetic\nand cladistic results indicated divergence between Caryophyllaceae,\nproblematically allied with Molluginaceae, and the betalain-producing\ncentrosperms. Three distinct clades emerged among the betalain taxa: a\nprimitive group of Nyctaginaceae + Phytolaccaceae; an intermediate group\nof Amaranthaceae + Chenopodiaceae; and an advanced group of\nsucculents√≥Aizoaceae + Cactaceae, Portulacaceae, and Basellaceae +\nDidiereaceae. We present a revised classification of Centrospermae,\nemphasizing cladistic relationships of the 11 core families and\nincluding several aberrant or little-known genera subordinated and\nsequenced according to conventions described by Wiley (1981). The new\nclassification is compatible with recent interpretations of floral\nhomologies and with external data from nucleic acid, ultrastructural,\nand serological comparisons.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5511.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5512.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5513.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5514.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5508.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5509.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5510.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centrospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5507.phy"}]}
