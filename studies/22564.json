Therefore, here we introduced Monochaetia sinensis as a novel\ntaxon with comprehensive description and illustration.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110867.phy"}]}
