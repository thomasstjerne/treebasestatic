{"Authors":" David Adler Gold","Year":" 2017","Title":" Paleoproterozoic sterol biosynthesis and the rise of\noxygen","Journal":" Nature","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" Natural products preserved in the geologic record can\nfunction as “molecular fossils”, providing insight into organisms and\nphysiologies that existed in the deep past. One important group of\nmolecular fossils is the steroidal hydrocarbons (steranes), which are\nthe diagenetic remains of sterol lipids. Complex sterols with modified\nside chains are unique to eukaryotes, although simpler sterols can also\nbe synthesized by a few bacteria. Sterol biosynthesis is an\noxygen-intensive process; thus, the presence of complex steranes in\nancient rocks not only signals the presence of eukaryotes, but also\naerobic metabolic processes. In 1999, steranes were reported in 2.7\nGyr-old rocks from the Pilbara Craton in Australia, suggesting a long\ndelay between photosynthetic oxygen production and its accumulation in\nthe atmosphere (also known as the Great Oxidation Event) 2.452.32 Gyr\nago. However, the recent reappraisal and rejection of these steranes as\ncontaminants pushes the oldest reported steranes forward to ~1.64 Gyr.\nIn the present study, we use a molecular clock approach to improve\nconstraints on the evolution of sterol biosynthesis. We infer that\nstem-eukaryotes shared functionally modern sterol biosynthesis genes\nwith bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. Comparing multiple molecular\nclock analyses, we find that the maximum marginal probability for the\ndivergence time of bacterial and eukaryal sterol biosynthesis genes is\n~2.31 Gyr ago, concurrent with the most recent geochemical evidence for\nthe Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Our results therefore suggest that\nsimple sterol biosynthesis existed well before the diversification of\nliving eukaryotes, substantially predating the oldest detected sterane\nbiomarkers (~1.64 Gyr), and furthermore, that the evolutionary history\nof sterol biosynthesis is tied to the first widespread availability of\nmolecular oxygen in the ocean-atmosphere system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Rax SQMO with removed seqs","ntax":"256","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96297","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96297.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Basal Excavates","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96290","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96290.phy"},{"tree_label":"Raxml","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96291","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96291.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96292","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96292.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Bikont Excavates","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96293","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96293.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML OSC with removed seqs","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96294","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96294.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Excavates Basal","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96295","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96295.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Bikont Excavates","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96296","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96296.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Excavates Basal","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96298","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96298.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Bikont Excavates","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96299.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Basal Excavates","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96300.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96301.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96302.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96303.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Bikont Excavates","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96304.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Excavates Basal","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96305","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96305.phy"}]}
