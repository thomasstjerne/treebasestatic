In this study, comprehensive analysis of three genomes of C.\nsubterraneus subspecies was carried in order to identify genes encoding\nkey metabolic enzymes and to document the genomic basis for the\nevolution of these organisms. Results The three genomes of C.\nsubterraneus showed high similarity, although there are substantial\ndifferences in their gene composition and organization. Each subspecies\npossesses a gene cluster encoding a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH)\nand an energy converting hydrogenase (ECH). The CODH gene is associated\nwith an operon that resembles the Escherichia coli hydrogenase hyc/hyf\noperons, a novel genetic context distinct from that found in\narchetypical hydrogenogenic carboxydotrophs. Apart from the\nCODH-associated hydrogenase, these bacteria also contain other\nhydrogenases, encoded by ech and hyd genes. An Mbx ferredoxin:NADP\noxidoreductase homolog similar to that originally described in the\narchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus was uniquely encoded in the C. subterraneus\nsubsp. yonseiensis genome. Compositional analysis demonstrated that some\ngenes of the CODH-ECH and mbx operons present distinct sequence patterns\nin relation to the majority of the other genes of each genome.\nPhylogenetic reconstructions of the genes from these operons and those\nfrom the ech operon are incongruent to the species tree. Notably, the\ncooS gene of C. subterraneus subsp. pacificus and its homologs in C.\nsubterraneus subsp. tengcongensis and C. subterraneus subsp. yonseiensis\nform distinct clades. The strains have diverse hydrolytic enzymes and\nthey appear to be proteolytic and glycolytic. Divergent glycosidases\nfrom fourteen families, among them amylases, chitinases,\nalpha-glucosidases, beta-glucosidases, and cellulases, were identified.\nEach of the three genomes also contains around one hundred proteases\nfrom fifty subfamilies, as well about ten different esterases.\nConclusions Genomic information suggests that multiple horizontal gene\ntransfers conferred the adaptation of C. subterraneus subspecies to\nextreme niches throughout the carbon monoxide utilization and hydrogen\nproduction. The variety of hydrolases found in their genomes indicate\nthe versatility of the species in obtaining energy and carbon from\ndiverse substrates, therefore these organisms constitute a remarkable\nresource of enzymes with biotechnological potential.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MbxF ML","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89855","tree_kind":"Species
