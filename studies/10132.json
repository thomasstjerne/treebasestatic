Because\nof this relationship with cold climates, it is sometimes assumed that\nmany origins of squamate viviparity occurred over the past 2.5-4 million\nyears during the Pleistocene-Pliocene glaciations; however, this\nhypothesis is untested. Divergence-dating analysis on a 733-species tree\nof iguanian lizards recovers 20 independent lineages that have evolved\nviviparity and among 14 multispecies groups 13 derived live birth prior\nto glacial advances (8-66 million years ago). These results place the\ntransitions from egg-laying to live birth among squamates in a\nwell-supported historical context to further examine the underlying\nphenotypic and genetic changes associated with this complex shift in\nreproduction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Anolis spp. clade","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anolis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6036.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 sup.","ntax":"407","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Draco spp. clade","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Draco","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Liolaemus spp. clade","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liolaemus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6035.phy"}]}
