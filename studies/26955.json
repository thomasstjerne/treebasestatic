Based on nucleotide sequences of the\nrDNA ITS region and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 and 2 gene, a\ntaxonomic group was segregated from G. splendens. This new taxonomic\ngroup had no evident difference compared to G. splendens on morphology\nand virulence on host plants. However, the phylogenetic variation was\ncomparable as the species-level in the molecular taxonomy. In order to\navoid confusion regarding the molecular identification, we taxonomically\ncharacterized the phylogenetic group and proposed it as a new species\nnamed G. cryptosplendens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globisporangium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130905.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globisporangium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130904.phy"}]}
