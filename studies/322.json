We reexamined this\nissue in light of a morphological data set composed of 207 characters\nand molecular data sets of published 12S, 16S, and cytochrome b\nmitochondrial DNA sequences. We reach four primary conclusions: (1) our\nmorphological data set strongly supports the traditional view of\nodontocete monophyly; (2) the unrooted molecular and morphological trees\nare very similar, and most of the conflict results from alternative\nrooting positions; (3) the rooting position of the molecular tree is\nsensitive to choice of artiodactyl outgroup taxa and the treatment of\ntwo small but ambiguously aligned regions of the 12S and 16S sequences,\nwhereas the morphological root is strongly supported; and (4) combined\nanalyses of the morphological and molecular data provide a\nwell-supported phylogenetic estimate consistent with that based on the\nmorphological data alone (and the traditional view of toothed-whale\nmonophyly) but with increased bootstrap support at nearly every node of\nthe tree.
