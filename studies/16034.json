These species were\nisolated from water samples collected from aquatic environments such as\npond or lakes in Japan. They were morphologically identified as Pythium\nby their filamentous sporangia, and its identification were supported by\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) region and D1â“D2 region of large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA\ngene, and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. A\ncomparative study of the new species with closely related species, their\nclade positions, and morphological features are described in this\narticle.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of three new species, Pythium\nabsentium, P. brachiatum and P. biformum, with the clade B species\ninferred from sequences of the ITS region","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75841.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76186.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76185.phy"}]}
