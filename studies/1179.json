We generated nuLSU and\nmtSSU rDNA sequences of members of seven families of pyrenocarpous\nlichens, and used a Bayesian framework to infer a phylogenetic estimate.\nMembers of the perithecioid Protothelenellaceae, Thelenellaceae, and\nThrombiaceae surprisingly cluster within the mainly discocarpous\nLecanoromycetes, while Strigulaceae, Verrucariaceae, and Pyrenulaceae\nare related to the ascolocular Chaetothyriomycetes. Micromorphological\nstudies of the ascomata showed that the two main groups of pyrenocarpous\nlichen-forming fungi differ in their ascus types. The Strigulaceae,\nVerrucariaceae, and Pyrenulaceae have apically and laterally\nthick-walled asci, whereas the Thelenellaceae, Protothelenellaceae and\nThrombiaceae have only apically thickened asci. The latter two show\nring-shaped amyloid apical structures. Based on morphological and\nmolecular evidence we propose to reduce Thrombiaceae to synonymy with\nProtothelenellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenocarpous Lichens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1822.phy"}]}
