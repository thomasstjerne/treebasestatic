Representatives\nfrom each of the chelicerate orders and mandibulate and onychophoran\noutgroups are examined. Molecular (small and large ribosomal subunit\nDNA) and morphological information is combined in a total evidence\nregime to determine the most consistent picture of extant chelicerate\nrelationships for these data. Multiple phylogenetic analyses are\nperformed with variable analysis parameters yielding largely consistent\nresults. A normalized incongruence length metric is used to assay the\nrelative merit of the multiple analyses. The combined analysis with\nlowest character incongruence yields the scheme of relationships\n(Pycnogonida+\n(Xiphosura+((Opiliones+((Solifugae+Pseudoscorpiones)+Scorpiones)),((Ricinulei+Acari)+(Palpigradi+\n((Thelyphonida+Schizomida=Uropygi)+(Amblypygi+ Araneae))))))). This\nresult is fairly robust to variation in analysis parameters, with the\nplacement of solifugids and the status of the pedipalps responsible for\nmost disagreement.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chelicerates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3434.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chelicerates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3435.phy"}]}
