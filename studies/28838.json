Both species have urniform basidia with more than four\nsterigmata and monomitic hyphal system, oil-rich hyphae in subiculum,\nwhich is typical for this genus. Sistotrema chloroporum is characterized\nby poroid hymenophore partly yellowish-green, basidia 46-spored,\nmedium-sized basidiospores (4.56.5 × 3.56.0 µm), and broadleaf forest\nhabitat. Sistotrema flavorhizomorphae is characterized by\nhydnoid-irpicoid hymenophore, bright yellowish rhizomorphs, basidia\n68-spored, small basidiospores (3.03.5 × 2.53.0 µm), and pine forest\nhabitat. Phylogenetic trees inferred from fungal nrDNA ITS and LSU\nsequences and that of rpb2 gene fragment supported that both species\nwere distinct and grouped with other ectomycorrhizal Sistotrema and\nHydnum species, but their generic boundary was unclear. Mycorrhizae\nunderneath basidiomes of both species were identified and described via\nmolecular techniques. Mycorrhizae of S. chloroporum have similar\ncharacteristics to those of other Sistotrema s.l. and Hydnum species,\ni.e., S. confluens and H. repandum, whereas S. flavorhizomorphae has a\ndistinct morpho-anatomy, for example, a distinct pseudoparenchymatous\nmantle. Comprehensive characterizations of basidiomes and mycorrhizae\nimprove the taxonomic analysis of mycorrhizal species of Sistotrema\ns.l.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134892.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134893.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133950","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133950.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134977","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134977.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134978","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134978.phy"}]}
