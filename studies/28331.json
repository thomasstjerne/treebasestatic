This\nmetabolite group is present only in Celastraceae plants, and it has\nshown various biological activities from antioxidant to anticancer\nproperties. However, most QMTs metabolites including 20-HM cannot be\nsynthesized in a laboratory. Therefore, we optimized a plant tissue\nculture protocol and examined the potential of Gymnosporia heterophylla\n(synonym. Maytenus heterophylla) to produce 20-HM in an in vitro\nexperiment. For the first time, we reported the optimum callus induction\nmedium with a high percentage success rate of 82% from the combination\nof 1 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid and 5 mg/L naphthalene acetic acid.\nLater, our cell suspension culture cultivated in the optimum medium\nprovided approximately 0.35 mg/g fresh weight of 20-HM. This\nconcentration is roughly 87.5 times higher than a concentration of 20-HM\npresenting in Elaeodendron croceum (Celastraceae) leaves. In addition,\nwe also found that 20-HM presented in a cultivation medium, suggesting\nthat G. heterophylla cells secreted 20-HM as an exudate in our\nexperiment. Noticeably, 20-HM was missing when Penicillium cf.Â olsonii\noccurred in the medium. These findings hint at an antifungal property of\n20-HM.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnosporia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136160.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnosporia rcbL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136159.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnosporia FRS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnosporia matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136158.phy"}]}
