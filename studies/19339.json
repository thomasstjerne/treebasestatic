H. H. Blom & Tønsberg\ncomb. nov. (≡ Lobaria virens (With.) J.R. Laundon). The cyanomorph of R.\nvirens is dendriscocauloid. The observed early developmental stages\ninvolve (1) a free-living cyanomorph and (2) a photosymbiodeme composed\nof the cyanomorph supporting small, foliose, chloromorphic lobes.\nWhereas the chloromorph continues to grow, the cyanomorph decays and\ndisappears leading to the final stage (3), the free-living chloromorph.\nSecondary cyanomorphs emerging from the chloromorph are not known.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ricasolia virens ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97535.phy"}]}
