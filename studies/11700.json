A molecular phylogeny of the\nspecies-rich and morphologically and ecologically diverse genus Mimosa\nwas generated to evaluate its infrageneric classification, reconstruct\nthe evolution of a set of morphological characters, and establish the\nrelationships of Old World species to the rest of the genus. Methods: We\nused trnD-trnT plastid sequences for 259 species of Mimosa (ca. 50% of\nthe total) to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. Six morphological\ncharacters (petiolar nectary, inflorescence type, number of stamens,\nnumber of petals, pollen type, and seismonasty) were optimized onto the\nmolecular tree. Key results: Mimosa was recovered as a monophyletic\nclade nested within the Piptadenia group and includes the former members\nof Schrankia, corroborating transfer of that genus to Mimosa. Although\nwe found good support for several infrageneric groups, only one section\n(Mimadenia) was recovered as monophyletic. All but one of the\nmorphological characters analyzed showed high levels of homoplasy. High\nlevels of geographic structure were found, with species from the same\narea tending to group together in the phylogeny. Old World species of\nMimosa form a monophyletic clade deeply nested within New World groups,\nindicating recent (6 Â– 10 Ma) long-distance dispersal. Conclusions:\nAlthough based on a single plastid region, our results establish a\npreliminary phylogenetic framework for Mimosa that can be used to infer\npatterns of morphological evolution and relationships and which provides\npointers toward a revised infrageneric classification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 231+","ntax":"297","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mimosa","tree_kind":"Species
