Phylogenetic inferences made from the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA\nsequences indicate that M. humicoloides is a member of the\nTrichocomaceae and that it is related to Merimbla ingelheimensis,\nHamigera avellanea, and Penicillium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Merimbla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_852.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Merimbla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_853.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Merimbla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_854.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Merimbla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_855.phy"}]}
