In this article, the isolated fungus was studied\nthrough a complete examination based on multilocus phylogeny of a\ncombined dataset of ITS rDNA, LSU and RPB2, in conjunction with\nmorphological, physiological and ecological characteristics. This\nintegrative analysis allowed the description of a new family,\nAeminiaceae fam. nov., a new genus Aeminium gen. nov. and a new species,\nAeminium ludgeri sp. nov., in the order Capnodiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeminiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115925.phy"}]}
