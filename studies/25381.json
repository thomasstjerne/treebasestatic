Since then,\nrecords of this species have been limited, and therefore no cultures\nhave been established and its phylogenetic position is unknown.\nRecently, synnemata on Macroscytus japonensis were collected from\nKanagawa Prefecture, Japan. These were identified as I. macroscyticola\nbased on the morphologies of the synnemata, conidiophores, and conidia.\nSince cultures established by conidial isolations exhibited pale\npurplish colonies and Acremonium-like synanamorph, this species was\nsuggested to belong to Purpureocillium (Ophiocordycipitaceae) rather\nthan Isaria (Cordycipitaceae). The sequence similarities of the internal\ntranscribed spacer region and 28S of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the\nelongation factor 1-alpha gene sequence of I. macroscyticola and P.\nlilacinum were 99100%. Furthermore, I. macroscyticola was\nphylogenetically nested within the P. lilacinum clade. Accordingly, we\nconclude that I. macroscyticola is a synnematous form and synonym of P.\nlilacinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cydnidae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120765.phy"}]}
