The pathogen is generally referred to in\nliterature under its teleomorphic name, Guignardia musae, or that of its\npurported anamorph, Phyllosticta musarum. Based on morphological and\nmolecular data from a global set of banana specimens, several species\nwere found associated with freckle disease. Phyllosticta maculata (from\nSoutheast Asia and Oceania) is introduced as a new name for Guignardia\nmusae, and an epitype is designated from Australia. Phyllosticta musarum\n(from India and Thailand) is shown to represent a distinct species, and\nthe name is fixed by designation of an epitype from India. Guignardia\nstevensii is confirmed as distinct species from Hawaii, while Guignardia\nmusicola from northern Thailand is shown to contain different taxa and\nis regarded as nomen confusum. Phyllosticta cavendishii is described as\na new, widely distributed species, appearing primarily on Cavendish, but\nalso on non-Cavendish banana cultivars.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta species associated with freckle disease of\nbanana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta species associated with freckle disease of\nbanana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59186.phy"}]}
