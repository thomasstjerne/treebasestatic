Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses of\ncombined SSU, ITS and LSU gene sequence data show that N. didymospora\nbelongs in Didymosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales. The new species is compared\nwith other morphologically and phylogenetically similar species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Neokalmusia didymospora ML analysis by LSU, SSU and ITS\ngenes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89818.phy"}]}
