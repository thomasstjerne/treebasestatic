The rust forms concentric sori on the adaxial\nsurface of host leaves. This fungus is a potential pathogen for\neconomically important Allium plants. Initially, we observed in planta\nfungal structures using newly developed whole-leaf fluorescent imaging\nmethod to evaluate the rust lesion formation process. We then confirmed\nconspecificity of Japanese and European populations by comparing the\nmorphological characteristics and rDNA sequences. In addition, we\nestimated phylogenetic relationships among rust fungi on Allium plants.\nIn this study, we designate an epitype of U. japonicus based on fresh\nspecimens from Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"170119.aln tree","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101652.phy"}]}
