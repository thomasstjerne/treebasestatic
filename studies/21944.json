Morphologically,\nthis new taxon is similar to the asexual morph of Lecanicillium and\ncharacterized by conidiophores arising from hyaline hyphae, with\ngregarious, ellipsoid to ovoid, aseptate conidia. Phylogenetic analyses\nof the combined LSU, SSU, tef1-α and ITS sequences data positions our\ntaxon within the Cordycipitaceae and close to Lecanicillium sp. (CBS\n639.85) and L. primulinum. Lecanicillium subprimulinum is introduced\nwith molecular data to support its new species status in\nLecanicillium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112661.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112630.phy"}]}
