Occasional diploid pine hybrids indicate the\npotential for introgression, but reticulation is hard to detect because\nancestral polymorphism is still shared across many groups of pine\nspecies. Nucleotide sequences for 53 accessions from 17 species in\nsubsection Ponderosae (Pinus) provide evidence for reticulate evolution.\nTwo discordant patterns among independent low-copy nuclear gene trees\nand a chloroplast haplotype are better explained by introgression than\nincomplete lineage sorting or other causes of incongruence. Conflicting\nresolution of three monophyletic Pinus coulteri accessions is best\nexplained by ancient introgression followed by a genetic bottleneck.\nMore recent hybridization transferred a chloroplast from P. jeffreyi to\na sympatric P. washoensis individual. We conclude that incomplete\nlineage sorting could account for other examples of non-monophyly, and\ncaution against any analysis based on single-accession or single-locus\nsampling in Pinus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LEA-like Ponderosae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6196.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"WD-40 Ponderosae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6119.phy"}]}
