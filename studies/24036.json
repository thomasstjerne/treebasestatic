In addition this group of fungi contains\nmany taxa that can impart blue-stain on sapwood and some are important\ntree pathogens. A recent survey that focussed on the diversity of the\nOphiostomatales in the forest ecosystems of the Czech Republic and\nPoland uncovered four putative new species. Phylogenetic analyses of\nfour gene regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region, ß-tubulin, calmodulin, and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-a) indicated that these four species are\nmembers of the genus Ophiostoma. All four newly described species can be\ndistinguished from each other and from closely related species based on\nDNA sequence comparisons, morphological characters, growth rates, and\ntheir insect associations. Based on this study four new taxa can be\ncircumscribed and the following names are provided: Ophiostoma\npityokteinis sp. nov., Ophiostoma rufum sp. nov., Ophiostoma solheimii\nsp. nov., and Ophiostoma taphrorychi sp. nov. O. rufum sp. nov. is a\nmember of the Ophiostoma piceae species complex, while O. pityokteinis\nsp. nov. resides in a discrete lineage within Ophiostoma s. stricto. O.\ntaphrorychi sp. nov. together with O. distortum formed a well-supported\nclade in Ophiostoma s. stricto close to O. pityokteinis sp. nov. O.\nsolheimii sp. nov. groups within a currently undefined lineage A, which\nalso includes Ophiostoma grandicarpum and Ophiostoma microsporum. This\nstudy highlights the need for more intensive surveys that should include\nadditional countries of Central Europe, insect vectors and host tree\nspecies in order to elucidate Ophiostoma species diversity in this\nregion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostoma grandicarpum complex BT ML-MP-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123852.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostoma piceae complex CAL ML-MP-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123846.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123848","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123848.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123851","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123851.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostoma piceae ITS ML-MP-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123850.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostoma piceae complex EF ML-MP-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostoma ITS-BT-CAL-EF comb ML-MP-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123847.phy"}]}
