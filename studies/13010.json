Recognition of this new species\nadds substantially to the record of the taxonomic diversity of these\nanimals west of the Rocky Mountains. The new species, S. morrisi, is\ndiagnosed by the possession of a postorbital having ornamentation in\nform of wide oblique groove on jugal process. Placement of this new\nspecies in Saurolophus considerably expands the distribution of this\ngenus, although this referral is arbitrary since phylogenetic analysis\nplaces the new species outside of the clade formed by S. osborni and S.\nangustirostris. However, recognition of a new, endemic Californian\nhadrosaurid, especially one so closely related to both Asian and North\nAmerican species, may have implications for future studies of both the\ninternal biogeography of Western North America, and the history of\nexchange with Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosauridea Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55246.phy"}]}
