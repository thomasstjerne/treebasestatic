The aim of this study was to characterize Ceratocystis\nisolates obtained from diseased mango trees in Brazil. Identification\nwas based on sequence data for the Internal Transcribed Spacer region 1\nand 2 including the 5.8S rRNA operon, part of the Beta-tubulin 1 gene\nand part of the Transcription Elongation Factor 1-alpha gene. The\nisolates from Brazil grouped in two well defined and unique clades\nwithin C. fimbriata s.l. These were also distinct from C. manginecans\nthat causes a similar disease associated with H. mangiferae in Oman and\nPakistan. Based on sequence comparisons and morphological\ncharacteristics, isolates representing the two phylogenetic clades are\ndescribed as C. mangicola sp. nov. and C. mangivora sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26143","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26143.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26147.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26146.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26145.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26149.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26157.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26152.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26154.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26156.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26148","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26148.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26153.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26155.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26158.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26144.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26150.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26151.phy"}]}
