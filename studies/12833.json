The core focus is on nature\ndiscovery - identifying and describing new species of plants and\nanimals. The Bush Blitz program has enabled the collection and\ndescription of beeflies (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from surveys in Western\nAustralia and Queensland. Three new species of Australian beeflies\nbelonging to the Exoprosopini are described; Palirika mackenziei Lambkin\nsp. n., Palirika culgoafloodplainensis Lambkin sp. n., and Larrpana\nbushblitz Lambkin sp. n. Phylogenetic analysis of 40 Australian\nexoprosopine species belonging to the Balaana generic-group Lambkin\n& Yeates 2003 supports the placement of the three new species into\nexisting genera, and the erection and description of the new genus\nNgalki Lambkin gen. n. for Ngalki trigonium (Lambkin & Yeates 2003)\ncomb. n. Revised keys are provided for the genera of the Australian\nBalaana genus-group and the species of Palirika Lambkin & Yeates,\n2003 and Larrpana Lambkin & Yeates 2003. With the description of the\nthree new species and the transferral of Munjua trigona Lambkin &\nYeates 2003 into the new genus Ngalki Lambkin gen. n., three genera are\nrediagnosed; Munjua Lambkin & Yeates 2003, Palirika and\nLarrpana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Exoprosopini 2003 46taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53452.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Exoprosopini 2011 BushBlitz 42taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53454.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"World Exoprosopini 2003 78taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53455.phy"}]}
