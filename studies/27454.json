However, the taxonomic position of this species\nremains unclear above the genus level. Here, we conducted molecular\nanalyses of C. nivalis using the ribosomal RNA operon sequences obtained\nfrom more than 200 cells of this species isolated from a field-collected\nmaterial. Our molecular phylogeny unveiled that C. nivalis is sister to\nBartheletia paradoxa, which is known as an orphan basal lineage of\nAgaricomycotina. We also exhibited that the C. nivalis sequences were\ncontained in the several previously examined meta-amplicon sequence\ndatasets from snowpacks and glaciers in Northern Hemisphere and\nAntarctica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricomycotina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130396.phy"}]}
