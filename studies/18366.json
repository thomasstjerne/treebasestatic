They are soilborne fungi\nwhich lack host specificity and invade the plant systemically causing\nwilt symptoms. In this work, we functionally characterized an APSES\nfamily transcription factor, which we designated Vst1, in two\nVerticillium species; V. dahliae, main causal agent of Verticillium wilt\nwhich produces highly durable microsclerotia, and V. nonalfalfae, a\nresting mycelium producing species. We showed that Vst1 is required for\nmicrosclerotium biogenesis and plays a critical role in melanin\nsynthesis which is independent from its role in morphogenesis.\nGeneration of the characteristic verticillate conidiophore was also\nfully dependent on Vst1 activity. Furthermore, sporulation rates in\nliquid medium were greatly reduced in the mutants of both species. Yet\nthese strains were fully pathogenic in two different hosts. Comparison\nof Vst1 functions and those of previously characterized components of\nG-protein signaling suggest that both regulate conidiation and\nmicrosclerotium biogenesis but playing opposite roles. We propose that\nstrains with altered Vst1 activity can be used in Verticillium species\nas tools to analyze at the molecular level developmental processes which\nplay a role in the disease cycle and might therefore be a target for\ndisease control.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91048","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91048.phy"}]}
