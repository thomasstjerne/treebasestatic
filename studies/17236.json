Our results robustly resolve the position of the enigmatic\neastern North American Four-toed Salamander (Hemidactylium) as the\nsister taxon of Batrachoseps + Tribe Bolitoglossini, thus settling a\nlongstanding question. Furthermore, we statistically reject sister taxon\nstatus of Karsenia and Hydromantes, the only plethodontids to occur\noutside the Americas, leading us to new biogeographic hypotheses.\nContrary to previous longstanding arguments that plethodontid\nsalamanders are an old lineage originating in the Cretaceous (more than\n90 Ma), our analyses lead to the hypothesis that these salamanders are\nmuch younger, arising close to the K-T boundary (~66 Ma). These time\nestimates are highly stable using alternative calibration schemes and\ndating methods. Our data simulation highlights the potential risk of\nmaking strong arguments about phylogenetic timing based on inferences\nfrom a handful of nuclear genes, a common practice. Based on the newly\nobtained timetree and ancestral area reconstruction results, we argue\nthat (i) the classic âOut of Appalachiaâ hypothesis of plethodontid\norigins is problematic; (ii) the common ancestor of extant plethodontids\nmay have originated in northwestern North America in the early\nPaleocene; (iii) origins of Eurasian plethodontids likely result from\ntwo separate dispersal events from western North America via Beringia in\nthe late Eocene (~ 42 Ma) and the early Miocene (~ 23 Ma), respectively;\n(iv) loss of lungs in plethodontids may result from fundamental\nbiomechanical conflicts resulting from increasing terrestriality rather\nthan being a rheotrophic adaptation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85985.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85988.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85987","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plethodontidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plethodontidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85989","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85989.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85992","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85994","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85995","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85986","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85984.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85991.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85993","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plethodontidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85983.phy"}]}
