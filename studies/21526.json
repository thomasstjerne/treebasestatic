It also forms a phylogenetically well-supported clade with\nPhaeoacremonium species, based on ITS sequences. The new taxon is\ncharacterized by having ascomata with relatively long (300380 μm)\nconical necks and suballantoid to oblong, slightly curved ascospores\nwith rounded ends and small guttules at their ends. P. rhizophorae is\nsignificantly different from all the other species of the genus\nPhaeoacremonium being saprobic on Rhizophora mucronata. This is the\nfirst record of Phaeoacremonium species form the marine\nenvironment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106784.phy"}]}
