In order to develop\na molecular method for the characterization of Japanese Phytophthora\nspecies, we obtained nuclear (rDNA ITS and LSU regions) and\nmitochondrial (cox1) DNA sequences from 152 isolates representing 21\nknown species and 10 unidentified isolates. These were compared with\nsimilar sequences from representative isolates of known species. Of\nthese, 125 isolates were found to have been correctly identified. Among\nthe remaining 37 isolates, 19 showed high homology with other described\nspecies. The remaining 18 isolates showed only low levels of homology\nwith any known species, and generated monophyletic sub-clades in a\nphylogenetic tree based on the ITS and LSU regions and the coxI gene.\nTherefore, these isolates are candidates for new species, falling into\nsix groups. Together, the Japanese isolates were found to represent\nphylogenetically diverse groups of species. In a sequence variation\nanalysis, the rDNA ITS regions and the coxI genes were found to be more\nvariable than the rDNA LSU sequences, suggesting that they will be more\nuseful for Phytophthora identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese Phytophthora isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59565.phy"}]}
