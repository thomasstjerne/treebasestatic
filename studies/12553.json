Five chloroplast markers (trnT-L,\ntrnL-F, and psbA-trnH intergenic spacers as well as the trnL and trnG\nintrons) and two nuclear markers (ITS, ETS) were used, totalling in 3809\nbase pairs. Tylophorinae are strongly monophyletic and consist of\nseveral well-defined clades. Backbone resolution between these clades is\nlow, indicating a rapid early radiation. Pentatropis is sister to all\nremaining taxa, albeit with weak support; all other taxa form one big\nclade not corresponding to previous generic delimitations. Therefore,\nall genera except for Pentatropis are subsumed under Vincetoxicum. The\nearly branching clades of Vincetoxicum s.l. all grow in Africa, where\nthe group originated ca. 18 Ma ago, correlating with the closure of the\nTethys Ocean. The first round of differentiation took place between 12\nand 15 Ma ago, resulting in Tylophorinae being distributed over almost\nall of their present range except for South Africa, Arabia and Europe.\nTwo unrelated lineages of temperate, mostly erect plants hitherto named\n“Vincetoxicum” have arisen from more tropical lineages, hitherto named\n“Tylophora”. One clade of African species is nested inside the\nAustralasian assemblage; this clade contains exclusively polyploid\nspecies and its re-immigration to Africa took place in the Messinian, at\nca. 6.8 Ma. The European Vincetoxicum species split from erect steppe\nplants of temperate Asia at ca. 4.5 Ma, coinciding with the uplift of\nthe Tibetan plateau. This group contains two species that are presently\naggressively spreading in North America after chance introductions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monophyly ML best tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52493.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monophyly MPBoot","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monophyly MP bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52492.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae: Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52488.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae: ML tree (GARLI)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52489.phy"},{"tree_label":"DS2a","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae nrDNA Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52519.phy"},{"tree_label":"DS2b","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52521.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae- strict consensus of 2,130","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52486.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPBoot","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae: MP - Bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52487.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLboot","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorinae: ML bootstrap (GARLI)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52490.phy"},{"tree_label":"MonoMLBoot","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monophyly ML bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52494.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPstrict","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylophorina monophyly MP strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52491.phy"}]}
