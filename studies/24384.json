This study is the first to include\nthe genus in a molecular phylogenetic analysis. We sequenced the plastid\ntrnL-trnF and the nuclear ITS regions for three Ivodea species and\nrevealed that the genus is monophyletic and most closely related to the\nAfrican and Malagasy Vepris Comm. ex A.Juss., refuting earlier\nsuggestions of a close relationship between Ivodea and the Asian,\nMalesian, Australasian and Pacific genera Euodia J.R.Forst. &\nG.Forst. and Melicope J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. Ivodea and Vepris\nprovide another example of closely related pairs of Rutaceous groups\nthat have drupaceous and capsular/follicular fruits, respectively, and\nthus further confirming that fruit types are not suited to delimit\nsubfamilies in Rutaceae, as has often been done in the past. Ivodea was\nthe last of the seven Malagasy genera to be included in the Rutaceae\nphylogeny, making it possible to conduct an assessment of biogeographic\naffinities of the genera that occur on the island. Our assessments based\non sister group relationships suggest that the eight lineages\n(representing seven genera) of Malagasy Rutaceae either have African\n(three lineages) or Asian affinities (two lineages), although taxon\nsampling is insufficient to interpret the directionality of dispersal\nevents in the remaining three lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"trnLF_ITS_MrBayes_50_con_majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117223","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117223.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_MrBayes_50_con_majrule","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117222","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117222.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF_Mrbayes_50_con_majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117221","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117221.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF_RAxML","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117226","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117226.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_RAxML","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117225","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117225.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined_trnLF_ITS_RAxML","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117224","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117224.phy"}]}
