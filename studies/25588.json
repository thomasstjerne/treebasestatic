In a recent nematode classification system based on SSU\nrDNA, Cephalobomorpha was classified within the suborder Tylenchina with\nPanagrolaimomorpha, Tylenchomorpha and Drilonematomorpha. However,\nphylogenetic relationships among species within Tylenchina are not\nalways consistent, and the phylogenetic position of Cephalobomorpha is\nstill uncertain. In this study, in order to examine phylogenetic\nrelationships with other nematode groups, we determined the complete\nmitochondrial genome sequence of Acrobeloides varius, the first\nrepresentative of Cephalobomorpha, and used this sequence for\nphylogenetic analyses along with 101 other nematode species.\nPhylogenetic analyses using amino acid and nucleotide sequence data of\n12 protein-coding genes strongly support a sister relationship between\nA. varius and Acrobeles complexus (represented by partial mt genome\nsequence). Cephalobomorpha is found sister to all chromadorean species\n(excluding Plectus acuminatus of Plectida) separated from\nPanagrolaimomorpha and Tylenchomorpha, rendering Tylenchina\nnon-monophyletic. Mitochondrial gene order among Tylenchina species is\nnot conserved and gene clusters shared between A. varius and A.\ncomplexus are very limited. To better understand phylogenetic\nrelationships among Tylenchina members, mitochondrial genome information\nfrom underrepresented taxa representing Panagrolaimomorpha and\nCephalobomorpha needs to be further explored.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure2","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood based on amino acid dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121406.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplemental Figure S5","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood based on nucleotide dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121407.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplemental Figure S6","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood based on nucleotide excluding 3rd\ncodon dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplemental Figure S7","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian inference based on amino acid dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121409.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplemental Figure S8","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian inference based on nucleotide dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121410.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplemental Figure S9","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian inference based on nucleotide excluding 3rd\ncodon dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121411.phy"}]}
