During\nthe survey on diversity of boletes in northern and northeastern\nThailand, several Sutorius collections were obtained. Combined evidence\nfrom morphology and phylogenetic analyses of a three-genes data set\n(atp6, tef1 and rpb2) of the Sutorius collections along with selected\nBoletaceae in the Pulveroboletus group indicated that Thai collections\nrepresent seven new Sutorius species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sutorius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127460.phy"}]}
