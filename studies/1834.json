However, the\nmolecular phylogeny strongly suggests that this genus is not a natural\ntaxon, because the original and recorded strains that have been\nidentified as Schizochytrium spp. separately form three well-supported\nmonophyletic groups in the 18S rRNA gene tree. These three groups are\nclearly distinguishable by their combined morphological characteristics\nand the profiles of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoid\npigments they contain, although these are hard to distinguish using only\na single feature. Therefore, three different genera are proposed to\naccommodate these three groups, i.e., Schizochytrium sensu stricto,\nAurantiochytrium, and Oblongichytrium gen. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Labyrinthulomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4878.phy"}]}
