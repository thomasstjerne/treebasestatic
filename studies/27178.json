The species is characterized by\nresupinate basidiomata with smooth, cream hymenial surface, a monomitic\nhyphal system with generative hyphae bearing simple septate, ellipsoid,\nhyaline, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores (2.33.9 × 1.42.3 µm).\nPhylogenetic analyses of ITS and LSU nuclear RNA gene regions were\nperformed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference methods. The phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of\nITS+nLSU sequences showed that Callosus formed a monophyletic lineage\nand closely grouped with Phanerochaete and Rhizochaete.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126944.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126947.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126948.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126946.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126945.phy"}]}
