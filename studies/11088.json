However, molecular studies\nusing fossil calibrations have shown that many of these lineages existed\nat that time. Both birds and mammals are parasitized by obligate\nectoparasitic lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera), which have shared a long\ncoevolutionary history with their hosts. Evaluating whether many\nlineages of lice passed through the K-Pg boundary would provide insight\ninto the radiation of their hosts. Using molecular dating techniques we\ndemonstrate that the major louse suborders began to radiate before the\nK-Pg boundary. These data lend support to a Cretaceous diversification\nof many modern bird and mammal lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31277.phy"}]}
