As a consequence, since the genus Volvariella\nshould be restricted only to the dry, pubescent-fibrillose, small-spored\nspecies, the V. gloiocephala species complex is here accommodated in the\nnew genus Macrovolvaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI - con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 1.
