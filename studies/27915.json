Its morphologies were\ncharacterized by penicillate conidiophores with a stipe, dull, tapering\ntowards the apex and the curved stipe extension, cylindrical conidia. In\nthe phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU, cmdA, his3, ITS, tef1 and\ntub2 sequence data, this taxon was clustered as sister to Curvicladiella\ncignea within Nectriaceae. Based on the morphological characters and\nphylogenetic analyses, Curvicladiella paphiopedili sp. nov. was\nintroduced and illustrated with discussion of its phylogenetic\nplacement.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129499","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129499.phy"}]}
