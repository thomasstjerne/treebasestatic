Pairwise comparisons of\nthese alleles reveal two unexpected observations: (i) amino acid\nsequence similarity can be as low as 40% within species and (ii) some\ninterspecific similarities are higher than intraspecific similarities.\nThe gene genealogy clearly illustrates this unusual pattern of\nrelationships. The data suggest that some of the polymorphism at the S\nlocus existed prior to the divergence of these species and has been\nmaintained to the present. In support of this hypothesis, the number of\nshared polymorphic sites was found to exceed the number found in\nsimulations with independent accumulation of mutations. Strictly neutral\nevolution is exceedingly unlikely to maintain the polymorphism for such\na long time. The allele multiplicity and extreme age of the alleles is\nconsistent with Wrightâ€™s classic one-locus population genetic model of\ngametophytic self-incompatibility. Similarities between the plant S\nlocus and the mammalian major histocompatibility complex are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1662.phy"}]}
