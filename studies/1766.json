Two groups currently recognized are the subfamilies Eriogonoideae\nand Polygonoideae. An analysis using three chloroplast regions \u001arbcL,\nmatK and ndhF\u001a and an increased taxon sampling of Eriogonoideae does not\nsupport this delimitation. A new definition of the subfamilies is\nproposed: Polygonoideae is restricted to what has been recognized as\ntribe Persicarieae, Rumiceae, Polygoneae with the addition of\nMuehlenbeckia, and Eriogonoideae includes Antigonon, Brunnichia,\nCoccoloba, Ruprechtia, Triplaris, and Eriogonoideae s.s. Using the\nsecond intron of the nuclear region LEAFY, relationships among 28 taxa\nof Eriogonoideae s.s. were explored. The intron showed high levels of\nvariability and was only useful at low taxonomic levels. The genus\nEriogonum and Chorizanthe are not monophyletic and some implications for\nour understanding of the relationships within the clade are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygonaceae, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygonaceae, Strict Chloroplast","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2692.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygonaceae, Strict Exons","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygonaceae, Strict LEAFY 2i","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2694.phy"}]}
