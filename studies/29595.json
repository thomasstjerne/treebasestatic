Those derived from recombination\nbetween subtype B and subsubtype F1, with 18 reported, most of them of\nSouth American origin, are among the most diverse. Here we identify a\nHIV-1 BF1 recombinant cluster that is expanding in Spain, transmitted\nmainly via heterosexual contact, which, analyzed in near full-length\ngenomes in 4 viruses, exhibited a coincident BF1 mosaic structure, with\n12 breakpoints, that fully coincided with that of two viruses from\nBrazil (10BR_MG003 and 10BR_MG005), previously classified as CRF72_BF1.\nThe three remaining Brazilian viruses previously identified as CRF72_BF1\n(10BR_MG002, 10BR_MG004, and 10BR_MG008), exhibited mosaic structures\nhighly similar, but not identical, to that of the Spanish viruses and to\n10BR_MG003 and 10BR_MG005, with discrepant subtypes in two short genome\nsegments, located in pol and gp120env. Based on these results, we\npropose that the 5 viruses from Brazil previously identified as\nCRF72_BF1 actually belong to two closely related CRFs, one comprising\n10BR_MG002, 10BR_MG004, and 10BR_MG008, which keep their CRF72_BF1\ndesignation, and the other, designated CRF122_BF1, comprising\n10BR_MG003, 10BR_MG005 and the viruses of the identified Spanish\ncluster. Three other BF1 recombinant genomes, 2 from Brazil and 1 from\nItaly, previously identified as unique recombinant forms, were\nclassified as CRF72_BF1. CRF122_BF1, but not CRF72_BF1, was associated\nwith protease L89M substitution, reported to contribute to\nantiretroviral drug resistance. Phylodynamic analyses estimate the\nemergence of CRF122_BF1 in Brazil around 1987. Given their close\nphylogenetic relationship and similar structures, the grouping of\nCRF72_BF1 and CRF122_BF1 in a CRF family is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CRF122_PRRT_v8_review_iqtree","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136175","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136175.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF122_NFLG_v6_review_iqtree","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136176","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136176.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF122_NFLG_3BF1_v6_review_iqtree","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136177","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136177.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_6432-6519_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136180","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136180.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_571-1377_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136181","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136181.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_4327-4464_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136185","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136185.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_1378-4326_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136184","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136184.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_4465-4535_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136186","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136186.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_4912-5146_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136188","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136188.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_5147-6431_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136189","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136189.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_8268-8665_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136193","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136193.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_8880-9480_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136195","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136195.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3BF1_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_6432-6519_iqtree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136196","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136196.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_2BF1_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_2429-2618_iqtree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136183","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136183.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_7786-7933_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136191","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136191.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_7934-8267_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136192","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136192.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_8666-8879_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136194","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136194.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_2429-2618_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136178","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136178.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_BREPM1029_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_2479-2618_iqtree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136179","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136179.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_4536-4911_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136187","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136187.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRF72_CRF122_3B_3F1_B-F1ancestor_6432-7785_iqtree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136190","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136190.phy"}]}
