SAMT\ncatalyzes the formation of the volatile compound methyl salicylate,\nwhich is an important secondary metabolite for both pathogen defense and\nfloral fragrance in this family. Relationships inferred with SAMT cDNA\nsequences are mostly congruent with previous cpDNA estimates, which not\nonly increases our confidence in Solanaceae phylogeny, but it suggests\nthat paralogy and lineage sorting appear not to be severe for this\nnuclear gene at this phylogenetic level. Relationships observed with\nSAMT include Schizanthus as sister to the rest of the family. The second\nbranch was Schwenckioideae + Cestroideae. The final two lineages were\nPetunioideae sister to the X = 12 clade, which includes Nicotianoideae +\nSolanoideae. Although mostly congruent, one important phylogenetic\ndifference between previous cpDNA and nuclear SAMT phylogenetic\nestimates is noted. Nicandra and Exodeconus are not supported as sister\ntaxa; rather, Exodeconus is near the base of the Solanoideae while\nNicandra appears to belong to a lineage that includes Physalis,\nCapsicum, Solanum, and Datura. The results obtained in this study\nindicate that expanded sampling of taxa for SAMT and the study of\nadditional nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with cpDNA will be\nvaluable towards improving our understanding of Solanaceae\nphylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4425.phy"}]}
