Discordances between phylograms inferred from nuclear and\nplastid DNA sequences suggest that reticulate evolution has been\ninvolved in speciation within the clade. Nonetheless, our data do not\nallow ruling out certain alternative explanations for the discordances.\nSeveral pseudo-cryptic species are restricted to the margins of the\ngeneric distribution range. In a clade of H. cuneata sibling species\nfrom widely separated subtropical localities in the Indian Ocean, the\nSouth African sibling branches off first, leaving the Arabian and West\nAustralian species as closest relatives. We hypothesize that geographic\nisolation of the siblings may have taken place following Pleistocene or\nPliocene periods of climatic cooling during which subtropical species\noccupied larger distribution ranges. A more basal separation of\nAtlantic, Indo-Pacific, and Mediterranean species indicates vicariance.\nThe alternative events that could have caused this vicariance are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2374.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP majority rule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2375.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2376.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP majority rule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2377.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2378.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2379.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2380.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda section Halimeda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2381.phy"}]}
