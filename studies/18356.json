In the present\nstudy, we re-examined all available Chinese collections purported to be\nT. californicum, including herbarium specimens and newly collected\nmaterials, using morphological and molecular methods. The accessions\nseparated into seven clusters in a phylogenetic analysis based on ITS\nsequences of these materials. The ML tree generated using ITS, nrLSU,\nand EF-1Î± sequences from Chinese and worldwide Tuber species with\nglobose ascospores showed only two clades, i.e., the Puberulum clade and\nthe Latisporum clade. The Latisporum clade as recognized in this study\nincludes the species known from East Asia only and probably represents a\nnew lineage that arose in parallel with the Puberulum, Maculatum and\nGibbosum lineages. We concluded that no evidence supports for the\npresence of T. californicum in China, and that specimens misidentified\nas T. californicum belong to four species newly described herein: T.\nxuanhuaense, T. jinshajiangense, T. caoi, and T. parmomurphium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91010","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91010.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91017","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91017.phy"}]}
