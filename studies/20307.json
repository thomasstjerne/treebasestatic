The Amazon rainforest is being\ndeforested and habitat fragmentation is a serious threat for mycobiota.\nInformation about fungal species diversity and distribution in Amazonia\nis important, as they are important ecosystem members. Xylophallus\nxylogenus is the smallest phalloid fungi described to date. Xylophallus\nwas considered monospecific and is geographically restricted to the\nNeotropics. During field trips in Amazonia, morphological variation\nwithin Xylophallus was observed. We evaluated five independent DNA\nregions and their power for discovering putative species in the genus.\nWe also estimated the species trees for the genus and we tested\ncompeting models of species delimitation using Bayes factors. The\nresults reveal the presence of three evolutionary units within the\ngenus: one is X. xylogenus; another is a new species, here named\nXylophallus clavatus; and the third clade corresponds to a new variety\nof X. xylogenus that we describe as X. xylogenus var. riomadeirensis.\nThese findings demonstrate the mycological richness of Neotropical\nforests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100490.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100485","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100485.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100486","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100486.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100487","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100487.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100491.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100488.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100489","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100489.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100493.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100494.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100495.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100496.phy"}]}
