Forty-seven percent of the cut stumps were decayed and\n52% of the decayed stumps showed similar decay characteristics with\nyellowish orange to light brown coloration and expanded pockets in the\nheartwood. Morphological characteristics of the pure cultures isolated\nfrom the decay were similar to the cultures isolated from basidiocarps\nof Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato, found on fallen logs outside of\nthe research site. Also DNA analysis based on the combined data set of\nthree gene loci (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, heat shock\nprotein 80-1 and elongation factor 1-alpha genes) showed that the\nisolates from the decay are included in the same clade with the Japanese\nH. annosum s.l. isolates. They form a subclade to H. parviporum (the\nEuropean S group of H. annosum s.l.). This is the first report of\nmolecular determination of H. annosum s.l. isolated from root and butt\nrot in a plantation in Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4787.phy"}]}
