We argue that Ditangium should be restored as\na correct genus for T. cerasi, while the currently used generic name\nCraterocolla is to be treated as its younger synonym. Morphological,\necological and genetic variability of Ditangium cerasi is discussed, and\ntwo other Ditangium species are describedD. altaicum, sp. nov. and D.\nincarnatum, comb. nov. In addition, Exidia fulva is combined in\nGlobulisebacina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ditangium TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124597.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ditangium ITS-TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124596.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ditangium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124600.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ditangium TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124598.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ditangium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124599.phy"}]}
