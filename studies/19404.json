It currently includes more than 20 formally described\nspecies, and no new species of Rozella have been described since 1987.\nWe discovered a new Rozella species parasitizing Rhizoclosmatium\nglobosum (Chytridiales, Chytridiomycota) and investigated its\nmorphology, ultrastructure, and phylogenetic position. Herein named as\nRozella rhizoclosmatii sp. nov., the organism induces hypertrophy of the\nhost. Its zoospore is ultrastructurally similar to that of R. allomycis,\nalthough it has a unique zoospore ultrastructural feature, a lattice of\nperpendicular rods about the nucleus. The 18S rDNA molecular sequence of\nR. rhizoclosmatii is similar to that of the previously sequenced\n“Rozella ex Rhizoclosmatium”. This is the first study to inclusively\ncharacterize a new species of Rozella with morphological,\nultrastructural and molecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rozella rhizoclosmatii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96567.phy"}]}
