Despite recent progress in the\nphylogenetics of the genus, there are few morphological synapomorphies\nsupporting DNA-based clades. Leaflet anatomy can provide an understudied\nand potentially valuable source of information on the evolutionary\nhistory and systematics of this lineage. Fifty-nine leaflet anatomical\ntraits of 109 southern African Oxalis species were assessed in search of\nphylogenetically significant characters that delineate clades. Results:\nA combination of six leaflet anatomical traits (stomatal position,\nadaxial epidermal cells, abaxial epidermal cells, mesophyll, sheath\naround vascular tissue, degree of leaflet conduplication) clearly\nsupport various clades defined by previous DNA-based phylogenetic work.\nOther, mostly continuous leaflet anatomical traits were highly variable\nand showed less phylogenetic pattern. Conclusions: Major and unexpected\nfindings include the transition from ancestral hypostomatic leaflets to\nadaxially-located stomata in the vast majority of southern African\nOxalis, the loss of semi-swollen AB epidermal cells and the gain of\nswollen adaxial and abaxial epidermal cells in selected clades, and\nmultiple changes from ancestral bifacial mesophyll to isobilateral or\nhomogenous mesophyll types. The information gathered in this study will\naid in the taxonomic revision of this speciose member of the Greater\nCape Floristic Region and provide a basis for future hypotheses\nregarding its radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE
