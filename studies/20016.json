A robust clade containing a new combination\nPseudoascotaiwania persoonii, Bactrodesmiastrum species, Plagiascoma\nfrondosum and three new species, are introduced in the new order\nFuscosporellales (Hypocreomycetidae, Sordariomycetes). A sister\nrelationship for Fuscosporellales with Conioscyphales, Pleurotheciales\nand Savoryellales is strongly supported by sequence data. Taxonomic\nnovelties introduced in Fuscosporellales are four monotypic genera,\nviz.Â Fuscosporella, Mucispora, Parafuscosporella and Pseudoascotaiwania.\nA new taxon in its asexual morph is proposed in Ascotaiwania based on\nmolecular data and cultural characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fucosporellales LSU SSU RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112343.phy"}]}
