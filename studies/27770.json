Since 2014, three cryptic species of\nMacrophomina have been recognised by molecular methods. This study\nelucidates the taxonomy of Macrophomina species associated with\nbroadacre and horticultural crops in Australia. A five-locus\nphylogenetic analysis of 80 isolates from 28 plant species combined with\ngenealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition and\ncoalescent-based species delimitation approaches identified M.\nphaseolina, M. pseudophaseolina and M. tecta sp. nov., as present in\nAustralia. Macrophomina phaseolina was the most frequently isolated\n(87.5 %). Macrophomina pseudophaseolina is reported for the first time\nin Australia, and for the first time on Parkinsonia aculeata.\nMacrophomina tecta sp. nov. was isolated from stems of Sorghum bicolor\nand Vigna radiata with charcoal rot symptoms in Queensland and New South\nWales. The potential for two or more Macrophomina species to co-infect\nthe same host has implications for disease epidemiology and pathogen\nevolution. Future investigations into the distribution, biology, host\nrange and population diversity of the new Macrophomina records are\nneeded.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrophomina 5 loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129146.phy"}]}
