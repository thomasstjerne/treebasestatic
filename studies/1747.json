One of\nthese is the Cyphomandra clade, which includes about 50 neotropical\nspecies. These have traditionally been placed into two to three\nsections: S. section Pachyphylla (formerly recognized as the genus\nCyphomandra), S. section Cyphomandropsis, and S. section Glaucophyllum\n(monotypic and sometimes placed in S. section Cyphomandropsis).\nPhylogenetic relationships among 61 accessions of 35 species of the\nCyphomandra clade are investigated using sequence data from the nuclear\nITS region analysed using parsimony and Bayesian inference. The\nCyphomandra clade forms a monophyletic group, but the ITS data are\nequivocal as to the monophyly of sections Pachyphylla and\nCyphomandropsis. Four well-supported groups of species can be recognized\nwithin the Cyphomandra clade; these conform in part with species groups\nproposed on the basis of morphology. The distribution of\nself-incompatible and self-compatible breeding systems is mapped onto\nthe molecular cladogram, and patterns of evolution of enlarged anther\nconnectives, osmophores, and volatile composition are discussed in light\nof hypothesized phylogenetic relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyphomandra clade in Solanum, strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyphomandra clade in Solanum, MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2673.phy"}]}
