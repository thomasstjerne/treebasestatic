The species of Armillaria causing this disease have not been\nfully identified but it is believed that at least three species are\ninvolved. These included A. fuscipes (previously referred to as RFLP\nGroup I) and two unnamed species known as RFLP Group II and RFLP Group\nIII. The aim of the study was to use PCR-RFLP, sequences of the IGS-1\nregion of the rDNA operon and AFLP fingerprinting to characterize 27\nZimbabwean Armillaria isolates. PCR-RFLP tests showed that the isolates\nresided in five groups. Analysis of sequence data elucidated four\ngroups, which were also supported by AFLP data. Eleven isolates belonged\nto RFLP Group I which is considered to represent A. fuscipes, four\nisolates were most similar to those previously referred to as Zimbabwean\nRFLP Group II and two isolates clustered most closely with RFLP Group\nIII. The remaining isolates appear to represent Armillaria taxa not\npreviously found in Zimbabwe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria Zimbabwe, NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3034.phy"}]}
