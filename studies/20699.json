(Schizoparmeaceae) is\nprovided. The species was isolated from submerged detritus in a fen at\nBlack Moshannon State Park, Pennsylvania, USA and differs from all other\nConiella species by having ellipsoid to fusoid, inequilateral conidia\nthat are rounded on one end and truncate or obtuse on the other end with\na length/width ratio of 2.8. The draft genome is 36.56 Mbp and consists\nof 870 contigs on 634 scaffolds (L50 = 0.14 Mb, N50 = 76 scaffolds) with\n0.5% of the scaffold length in gaps. It contains 11,317 predicted gene\nmodels including predicted genes for cellulose, hemicellulose, and xylan\ndegradation as well as predicted regions encoding for amylase, laccase,\nand tannase enzymes. Many members of the Schizoparmeaceae are plant\npathogens of agricultural crops. This draft genome represents the first\nsequenced Coniella genome and will be a valuable tool for comparisons\namong pathogenic Coniella species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniella lustricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106896.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniella lustricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106897.phy"}]}
