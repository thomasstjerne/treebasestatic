The fungus\nthat caused the disease formed mainly the mycelium and conidial\nsporification, but several fruit bodies were also found. Only one of the\nchasmothecia was mature. Its morphological characteristics suggest that\nthe fungus belongs to the common North American species Erysiphe\n(Microsphaera) symphoricarpi. Two separate phylogenetic analyses using\nITS and 28S rDNA sequences were done in this study. The fungus on S.\nalbus collected in Ukraine grouped with E. symphoricarpi collected in\nHungary, UK, and USA with strong bootstrap supports (MP = 100 %, ML =\n100 %). This is the first record of this species in Ukraine. In 2015, E.\nsymphoricarpi was collected only in Kiev. It is assumed that the fungus\ncan cause significant damage to ornamental plantings of Ukraine.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97028.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97027.phy"}]}
