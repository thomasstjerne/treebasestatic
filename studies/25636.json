Here we present a multi-locus species delimitation analysis\nfor NE Atlantic species of Doto. The aims of the study are to test the\nspecies limits of Doto species from the North Sea area, as well as\nplacing them phylogenetically. We particularly wanted to investigate\npotential species hidden within our current understanding of Doto\nfragilis and Doto maculata. For this, one mitochondrial and one nuclear\ngene were analysed using both single- and multi-locus species\ndelimitation methods. A phylogeny was estimated with our dataset\ncombined with previously published data. In addition, we tested the\nresults of the molecular analysis against morphology and radular\nultrastructure for congruence. Ten species of Doto are distinctly\ndelimited and we find that Doto fragilis includes at least five species,\nthe nominative “true” D. fragilis and two new species D. malinka and D.\ntinekvammeae. The two nominative species D. hystrix and D. formosa are\nalso part of this complex. We also found that specimens from Sweden\napparently morphologically close to D. maculata have COI and H3\nsequences identical to D. coronata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121476","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121476.phy"}]}
