Heterodontosauridae\nis characterized by small, gracile bodies and a problematic phylogenetic\nposition. Recent phylogenetic work indicates that it represents the most\nbasal group of all well-known ornithischians. Previous heterodontosaurid\nrecords are mainly from the Early Jurassic period (205-190 million years\nago) of Africa. Here we report a new heterodontosaurid, Tianyulong\nconfuciusi gen. et sp. nov., from the Early Cretaceous period (144-99\nmillion years ago) of western Liaoning Province, China. Tianyulong\nextends the geographical distribution of heterodontosaurids to Asia and\nconfirms the cladeâ€™s previously questionable temporal range extension\ninto the Early Cretaceous period. More surprisingly, Tianyulong bears\nlong, singular and unbranched filamentous integumentary (outer skin)\nstructures. This represents the first confirmed report, to our\nknowledge, of filamentous integumentary structures in an ornithischian\ndinosaur.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterodontosauridae Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56085.phy"}]}
