Results We identified a hypomorphic allele\nof ChMOB2 in a random insertional mutant (vir-88) of the hemibiotrophic\nascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum. The mutant is impaired in\nconidiation, host penetration and virulence on Arabidopsis thaliana.\nChMob2 binds to and co-localizes with the NDR/LATS kinase homolog\nChCbk1. Mutants in the two potential ChCbk1 downstream targets ChSSD1\nand ChACE2 show defects in pathogenicity. The genome of C. higginsianum\nencodes two more Mob proteins. While we could not detect any effect on\npathogenicity in Î”Chmob3 mutants, ChMob1 is involved in conidiation,\nseptae formation and virulence. Conclusion This study shows that ChMob2\nbinds to the conserved NDR/LATS Kinase ChCbk1 and plays an important\nrole in pathogenicity of Colletotrichum higginsianum on Arabidopsis\nthaliana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum higginsianum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101447.phy"}]}
