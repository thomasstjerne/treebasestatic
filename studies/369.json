Molecular data agree with a recent taxonomic\ntreatment of Lane (1982, 1985), which transferred the x = 4 species from\nXanthocephalum and submerged Greenella into Gutierrezia, but they do not\nsupport the submersion of the monotypic genus Thurovia. Thurovia is\nclosely related as a sister group to Amphiachyris and should be\nresegregated from Gutierrezia. The study indicated that Xanthocephalum\nwith x = 6 is very distantly related to Gutierrezia, even though\nXanthocephalum has often been treated as part of the\nXanthocephalum-Gutierrezia complex. Xanthocephalum is, in contrast, very\nclosely related to Grindelia, which also has a base chromosome number of\nx = 6. Traditional species of Gutierrezia, G. californica, G. grandis,\nG. microcephala, G. sarothrae, G. serotina, and G. texana, constitute a\nclosely related cluster and are well-separated from other purported\nmembers of the genus. Gutierrezia californica s. str. and G. bracteata\nshould be separated again as distinct species. The herbaceous species,\nG. sericocarpa and G. sphaerocephala, appear to be the most primitive in\nthe genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gutierrezia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3254.phy"}]}
