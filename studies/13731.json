Numerous and exquisite examples of such behavioural\nalterations are known, covering a broad spectrum of parasites and hosts.\nMost descriptions of such parasite-induced changes in host behaviour are\nobservational reports, while experimentally confirmed examples of\nparasite genes inducing these changes are limited. In this paper we\nreview changes in invertebrate host behaviour observed upon infection by\nparasites, and discuss such changes in an evolutionary context. We then\nexplore possible mechanisms involved in parasite-induced changes in host\nbehaviour. Genes and pathways known to play a role in invertebrate\nbehaviour are reviewed, and we hypothesize how parasites (may) affect\nthese pathways. This review provides the state of the art in this\nexciting, interdisciplinary field by exploring possible pathways\ntriggered in hosts, and suggesting methodologies to unravel the\nmolecular mechanisms that lead to changes in host behaviour.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian PKG","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Insecta","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59773.phy"}]}
