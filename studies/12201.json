Most previous studies explored\nthe impact of indel inclusion on phylogenetic inferences by analyzing\neither computer simulation data or a small number of genes from\nexperimental work. Using many more indel characters than those in\nprevious studies, we here for the first time address this issue in the\ncontext of Arctoidea phylogeny. Our analyses, based on 6843 indel\ncharacters from 22 nuclear intron loci of 16 species of Arctoidea,\ndemonstrate that when the indels were not taken into consideration\n(âremoval of indelsâ and âmissing data coding schemeâ), the\nUrsidae/Pinnipedia monophyly tree and the Pinnipedia/ Musteloidea\nmonophyly tree were both recovered, whereas inclusion of indels by using\nthree different indel coding schemes, i.e., indels as the fifth state,\nsimple indel coding, and modified complex indel coding, give identical\nphylogenetic tree topologies supporting the Ursidae/Pinnipedia\nmonophyly, whatever the tree-building method was used. In addition,\ncomparison of indel incorporation methods revealed that the coding of\nindels as 5th state, simple indel coding and modified complex indel\ncoding are all advantageous over treating indels as missing data. This\nis the first report of the impact of indel coding on phylogenetic\nreconstruction at the family level in Carnivora, which indicates that\nindels should be taken into account when additional nuclear intron genes\nare used in the future phylogenetic analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined with indel as simple indel\ncoding","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50190.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50192.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined dataset with none gap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50194.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined with indel as missing data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50188.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined with indel as fifth state","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50189.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined with indel as modified complex\nindel coding","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50191.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined with indel as modified complex\nindel coding","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50193.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arctoidea, combined dataset with none gap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50195.phy"}]}
