Both morphological observations and molecular\nphylogenetic analyses indicated that the fungus is a member of the\npowdery mildew fungi. In this study, we report the morphological and\nmolecular characteristics of this fungus and propose Erysiphe fimbriata\nas a new species. Erysiphe fimbriata has large chasmothecia (200–250 µm\ndiam) with long (up to 4–5 mm in length), fimbriate appendages arising\nfrom the upper half of the chasmothecia and turning upward, and numerous\nasci (22–38 per chasmothcium). Erysiphe fimbriata is a unique fungus\nboth genetically and morphologically.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2927.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribe Erysipheae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2928.phy"}]}
