Previous phylogenetic analysis of Japanese accessions by\nusing nuclear-encoded single-copy AS1 suggested presence of three\ndistinct lineages and hybridizations among them. The analysis also\npredicted that the diversifications occurred at the continental Asia,\nnot in Japan. In this study, phylogenetic analysis was conducted using\nAS1 and chloroplast (cp) DNA (trnL-F and trnC-petN) to reveal details of\nthe diversifications and hybridizations in the entire C. japonica-C.\ntenuifolia species complex, covering wide area of the distribution. The\nanalyses revealed that 1) Accessions from Australia and Asia formed\ndistinct monophyletic clades in both AS1 and cpDNA tree. 2) Although\nseveral differences were found in topology and resolution between AS1\nand cpDNA tree within the Asian clade, the results were largely\nconsistent with each other. 3) In cpDNA tree, two diversifications\ncorresponding to their distributions were found and estimated to be\noccurred in Tertiary. 4) AS1 analysis revealed existence of seven\nlineages in Asian clade, and occurrences of inter-lineage hybridizations\namong four lineages. 5) The Asian lineages are morphologically cryptic.\nThe above results show a complex history of diversification and\nhybridizations among the lineages of C. japonica-C. tenuifolia species\ncomplex. This study provides useful data for understanding not only\nevolution of species complex but also lineage divergences in Tertiary E\nAsia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A MP tree of the AS1 alleles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_61923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A NJ tree of the AS1 alleles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61952.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A MP tree of the cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A MP tree of the cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62077.phy"}]}
