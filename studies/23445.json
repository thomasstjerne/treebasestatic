Morphologically, Phylloporia is characterized\nby annual or perennial basidiomata, a monomitic to dimitic hyphal\nsystem, mostly a duplex context, absence of setae and abundant tiny,\nthick-walled and colored basidiospores. In this study, specimens from\nChina and Brazil a priori identified to Phylloporia species were\nrevised. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nuc 28S rDNA-based showed\nthat they nested within the Phylloporia clade, in which they formed\neight new terminal lineages. According to this result and additional\nmorphological and ecological data (host relationships), these eight\nlineages are described as eight new species: Phylloporia atlantica, P.\ncystidiolophora, P. montana, P. perangusta, P. rattanicola, P. solicola,\nP. splendida, and P. subpulla. Detailed descriptions with illustrations\nare provided for these new species and their relationships with similar\nor allied species are discussed. An identification key for accepted 56\nspecies with synopsis description is provided, and two simple keys to\nneotropical and Asian Phylloporia species are also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylloporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114344.phy"}]}
