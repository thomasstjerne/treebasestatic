The lectotype have been designated in\nANGUC and a new combination Umbilicaria meizospora (Harm.) D.M. Masson\n& Davydov is proposed. Umbilicaria crustulosa var. badiofusca was\nrecognized as the heterotypic synonym of Umbilicaria meizospora and the\nlectotype was designated based on the Freys collection preserved in G.\nWe provide a full description of U. meizospora and its distribution and\necology. The species is newly reported from Austria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134198","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134198.phy"}]}
