Mitochondrial protein-coding genes (NADH-dehydrogenase\nsubunits 2 [ND2] and 6 [ND6], and mutS homolog [msh1], 1633 bp) from 28\nshallow-water species were sequenced to develop the first molecular\nphylogeny for Caribbean octocorals. The specimens were collected\nprimarily in the Caribbean or off Brazil in 1999-2001. Morphological\ncharacters (sclerites and axial ultra-structure) were also examined in\norder to map them onto the molecular phylogeny. Analyses of both\nnucleotide and amino acid substitutions using maximum parsimony and\nlikelihood (including maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis)\ngenerated very similar results, with most nodes having high levels of\nsupport. These molecular results were significantly different from the\ngenerally accepted classification. Neither Plexauridae nor Gorgoniidae\nwere monophyletic. Plexaurella spp., nominal plexaurids, were basal to\nthe gorgoniids, sharing many morphological characters with them. This\ncorroborates previous findings using secondary metabolites and\nbiosynthetic pathways. The sea fans, Gorgonia spp. and Pacifigorgia\nspp., as well as the pinnate gorgonians, Muriceopsis flavida and\nPseudopterogorgia spp., did not have sea fan or pinnate relatives,\nsuggesting there has been convergent evolution of colony form. Caribbean\nplexaurids appeared more derived and/or recently evolved according to\nboth morphological and molecular data (e.g., Eunicea spp. and Plexaura\nspp.). Molecular phylogenetics is a promising approach for\nreconstructing phylogenetic relationships among octocorals as well as to\nunderstand their complex morphology.
