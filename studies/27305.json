Lyomyces fissuratus is\ncharacterised by resupinate basidiomata with tuberculate, cracking\nhymenial surface and broadly ellipsoid to subglobose, colorless,\nslightly thick-walled, smooth basidiospores (46 × 3.65.3 µm). Lyomyces\nfumosus is characterised by resupinate, farinaceous to pruinose\nbasidiomata with smooth, smoky gray hymenial surface and broad ellipsoid\nto globose, colorless, slightly thick-walled basidiospores (3.86.2 ×\n3.35.4 µm). Sequences of ITS and LSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied\nsamples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods.\nThe phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of ITS+nLSU sequences\namong related genera with Lyomyces in Schizoporaceae showed that two new\nspecies nested into Lyomyces. The further phylogenetic tree in Lyomyces\ndemonstrated that L. fissuratus formed a monophyletic lineage and then\ngrouped with a clade comprising L. mascarensis, L. cremeus, L.\nmicrofasciculatus and L. wuliangshanensis. Lyomyces fumosus was sister\nto L. fimbriatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134197.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134196.phy"}]}
