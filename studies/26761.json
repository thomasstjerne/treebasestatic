We leveraged samples assembled over decades of\nfieldwork to study diversification of the largest tropical bird\nradiation, the suboscine passerines. Our phylogeny, estimated using data\nfrom 2389 genomic regions in 1940 individuals of 1287 species, reveals\nthat peak suboscine species diversity in the Neotropics is not\nassociated with high recent speciation rates but rather with the gradual\naccumulation of species over time. Paradoxically, the highest speciation\nrates are in lineages from regions with low species diversity, which are\ngenerally cold, dry, unstable environments. Our results reveal a model\nin which species are forming faster in environmental extremes but have\naccumulated in moderate environments to form tropical biodiversity\nhotspots.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1286","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125281.phy"}]}
