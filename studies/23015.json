Twenty-one phylotypes were recognized\nwith the threshold of 97% ITS identity. Seven phylotypes corresponded to\nthe described species H. bailii, H. cerebriformis, H. cubispora, H.\nlaojunshanensis, H. michaelis, H. cf. variiformis and H. tulasnei, and\nfour phylotypes represented by Chinese specimens were described and\nillustrated as new species, i.e. H. badia, H. brunneospora, H.\nnigricans, and H. puberula. The remaining ten phylotypes may represent\nundescribed species. Moreover, the twenty-one phylotypes grouped into\nfour distinct clades each having as core species H. cerebriformis, H.\ncubispora, H. michaelis and H. tulasnei, respectively, which were\nstrongly supported by phylogenetic analysis and morphological\ncharacterization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"raxml tree","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"raxml","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112705.phy"}]}
