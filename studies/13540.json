This fungus was isolated from peels of crabapple and hawthorn\ncollected from Liaoning and Shaanxi Provinces, and exhibited the\npunctate mycelial type of sooty blotch and flyspeck on both hosts. Based\non morphological characteristics and analysis of DNA sequences, we\nidentified our isolates as P. fructicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peltaster fructicola ITS Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Peltaster fructicola","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peltaster fructicola ITS Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91888.phy"}]}
