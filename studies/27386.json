Two\nPhyllactinia species, P. fraxini and P. fraxinicola, have been known on\nFraxinus spp. so far. In this study, powdery mildews belonging to\nPhyllactinia were collected on Fraxinus from different areas of the\nworld to make molecular and morphological analyses. These specimens are\ndivided into four distinct molecular phylogenetic groups, which are\ndistinguishable by their morphology and/or host preference. Two new\nspecies, viz., P. japonica occurring on F. sieboldina and F. lanuginosa\nf.Â serrata, and P. fraxini-longicuspi on F. longicuspis, are proposed in\nthis study. An epitype is designated for P. fraxini. This study\nindicates strict host specificity among four Phyllactinia species on\nFraxinus, suggesting that genetic isolation by host specificity played\nmore important role than geographic segregation in the speciation events\nof these Phyllactinia species. Evolutionary timing calculated by\nmolecular clock analysis suggests that these powdery mildews diverged in\naccordance with host phylogeny after divergence of host plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127825.phy"}]}
