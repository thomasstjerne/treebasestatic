All substance classes examined were\nphylogenetically widespread, except for ß-orcinol meta-depsides and\nanthraquinones, which appeared rare and restricted to a single major\nclade. Benzyl esters were also found to be rare. Taxa producing each\nsubstance class examined were not monophyletic. The ability to regularly\nproduce orcinol para-depsides, ß-orcinol meta-depsides, ß-orcinol\ndepsidones, dibenzofurans, benzyl esters, terpenoids and anthraquinones\nappears to have been gained more than lost, while the ability to produce\nß-orcinol para-depsides and higher aliphatic acids has been lost more\nthan gained. Our results suggest that chemical similarities may not\nnecessarily indicate close phylogenetic relationships. Finally,\nancestral state reconstruction at the base of genus Lepraria suggests\nthat its ancestor produced ß-orcinol para-depsides (atranorin) but did\nnot produce orcinol para-depsides, ß-orcinol meta-depsides, benzyl\nesters or anthraquinones.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepraria, ML tree from MCMC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4905.phy"}]}
