Sequence data from 17\nDraba taxa and three outgroups were subjected to both parsimony and\nmaximum likelihood analyses. The resulting phylogenetic framework is\nused to test the validity of proposed infrageneric classifications for\nNorth American Draba, and examine the taxonomic value of flower color,\nchromosome base number, and growth habit.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Draba consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4149.phy"}]}
