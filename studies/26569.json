Both species are clearly distinguishable from other Tuber\nspecies by ocher tomentose mycelia covering ascomata surface. Tuber\niryudaensis is characterized by having one-spored asci and a huge\nascospore with reddish brown color, while these microscopic characters\nare similar to the related Chinese species. Tuber tomentosum forms one\nto four ascospores per ascus with reddish brown color as T. macrosporum\nand T. canaliculatum, although their spores are much smaller. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer and\npartial large subunit sequences support that both species are distantly\nrelated to known Tuber species within the Macrosporum group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124543","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124543.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124545","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124545.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124544.phy"}]}
