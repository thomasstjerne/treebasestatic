The 44 million\nyear old specimen shows close phylogenetic affinities with modern\nfeather louse ectoparasites of aquatic birds. Preservation of feather\nremnants in the specimens’ foregut confirms its association as a bird\nectoparasite. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the specimen and\npalaeoecological data we suggest this louse was the parasite of a large\nancestor to modern Anseriformes (swans, geese and ducks) or\nCharadriiformes (shorebirds). The crown group position of this fossil in\nthe phylogeny of lice confirms the groups’ long coevolutionary history\nwith birds and points to an early origin for lice, perhaps inherited\nfrom early-feathered theropod dinosaurs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amblycera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1738.phy"}]}
