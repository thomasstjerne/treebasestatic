They are endophytes, saprobes and\nimportant plant pathogens on a wide range of hosts. In the present\nstudy, saprobic Arthrinium species were isolated from bamboo plants\ncollected from Guangdong Province, China. Morphological comparison and\nphylogenetic analyses using four gene regions, internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS), large subunit rDNA (LSU), translation elongation factor\n1-alpha (tef1-Î±), and beta-tubulin (tub2) were subsequently performed\nfor species identification. Based on both morphology and phylogeny, a\nnovel species, Arthrinium guangdongense and one new host record,\nArthrinium euphorbiae on bamboo were identified. Species descriptions\nand morphological comparisons for these isolated taxa are given. The\nresults will be an additional contribution to the knowledge of fungi\nassociated with bamboo.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135871.phy"}]}
