Its cultivar selection has been\nchanging fast, following market demands. One of the limiting factors of\nstrawberry production worldwide is black root rot, primarily caused by\nbinucleate Rhizoctonia. Recently, outbreaks of black root rot of\nstrawberry have occurred in Serbia and the estimated disease incidence\nwas up to 30%. Isolates of binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A were recovered\nfrom symptomatic strawberry plants, and characterized on the bases of\nmorphological, molecular and pathogenic features. Despite their uniform\nmorphological characteristics, the isolates demonstrated genetic\nvariability within ITS rDNA, grouping into three different phylogenetic\nsub-clusters which comprise AG-A isolates originating from Italy,\nIsrael, Japan and the USA. The binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A from Serbia\nexhibited uniform virulence on strawberry after inoculation of daughter\nplants and detached leaf petioles, as well as on seedlings of bean,\ncarrot and sunflower, while they were non-pathogenic to wheat, maize,\ntomato, pepper, tobacco, cucumber, lettuce, peas, cabbage, rapeseed and\nsugar beet.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizoctonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125082.phy"}]}
