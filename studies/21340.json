Erysiphe azerbaijanica is distinguished from other\nErysiphe species reported on Castanea spp. based on the cylindrical\nconidia with length/width ratio 2Â–3.6 and its longer foot cells.\nMolecular analysis indicated that this species forms a clade of its own,\nsupporting the morphological observations. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses showed that E. blasti is divided into two different groups by\nits host species. Based on the observations of the holotype and the\ndifferences in numbers and length of appendages, the fungus on L.\npraecox was described as a new species, E. linderae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_23","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105900.phy"}]}
