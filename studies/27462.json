A new genus Alloscorias is\nestablished to accommodate this novel taxon, named A. syngonii. The\ncoelomycetous character of the asexual morph is observed on culture\nmedia. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined dataset of LSU, ITS, TEF-1Î±\nand RPB2 sequence data together with morphological indicate that\nAlloscorias is a distinct genus within Readerielliopsidaceae.
