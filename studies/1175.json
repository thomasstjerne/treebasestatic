It is the third sequestrate\nrepresentative of the Russulaceae described from tropical Africa.\nMorphological characters and DNA sequence data support its placement in\nthe genus Lactarius, subgenus Plinthogali. Molecular kinship analyses\nconfirm a multiple origin of sequestrate Russulaceae spp. As none of the\npreviously sequenced sequestrate Russulaceae spp. has been assigned to\nthe Plinthogali clade, the placement of L. angiocarpus indicates an\nadditional point of origin of derivative sporocarp types within the\nRussulaceae. Within the same subgenus, another tropical African\nsequestrate species, Lactarius dolichocaulis (Pegler) Verbeken &\nEberhardt comb. nov., is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Overview Russulaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Placement L. angiocarpus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1817.phy"}]}
