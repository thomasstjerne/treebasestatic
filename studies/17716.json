Two novel species of Cladophialophora were isolated from\nsurface-sterilized sclerotia of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum\ngeophilum that were extracted from soils of mixed pine-oak forests in\nFlorida, USA. Cladophialophora floridana and C. tortuosa form melanized\nconidia produced in coherent and infrequently branched chains that often\narise from semi-macronematous conidiophores. Both species form\nsubglobose to oblong conidia but the conidia of C. tortuosa are more\nfrequently and distinctly phaseoliform or sigmoid in shape. These two\nnovel species are clearly distinct from all known species of\nCladophialophora and closely-related other genera based on a combination\nof microscopic morphology and rRNA gene sequences, including the ITS and\npartial LSU regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Cladophialophora ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88225.phy"}]}
