The sequence of the amplified products\nwere compared with the several Phomopsis ITS sequences obtained from\ndatabases. The analysis revealed a diverse origin of the\nsunflower-isolated strains, which appear to belong to phylogenetically\nunrelated groups. Noticeably, the strains originally collected in France\nand in Yugoslavia, where the sunflower stem canker incidence has been\nreported to be severe, were very similar to each other and clearly\ndifferentiated from other Phomopsis clusters. Conversely, the strains\nisolated in Italy, where the incidence of the disease is low despite to\nthe favorable environmental conditions, showed sequence similarity with\nother previously established phylogenetic groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Identification","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis pathogenic to sunflower","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4524.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis pathogenic to sunflower","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4525.phy"}]}
