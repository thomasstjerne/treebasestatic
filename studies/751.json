These are three regions from the\nmitochondria (ca. 560 bp of 16S plus adjacent tRNA, 1047 bp of\ncytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1), and 414 bp of NADH1 (ND1) and one region\nfrom the nuclear genome (ca. 750 bp of 28S). Parsimony and likelihood\nanalyses of these gene regions separately and together support the\nmonophyly of the dendryphantines as delimited previously by\nmorphological characters. A group of elongate bodied genera are placed\nas basal among the dendryphantines, and previously proposed\nrelationships of Poultonella, Paraphidippus, and Sassacus vitis are\nconfirmed. Comparison of overall rates of molecular evolution indicates\nstriking differences across the gene regions, with highest divergence in\nND1, CO1, 16S, and 28S in decreasing order. All four regions are\ncharacterized by both within- and among-site rate variation.\nPhylogenetic results from CO1 conflict conspicuously with phylogenetic\nresults from the other genes and morphological data. Attempts to account\nfor potential sources of this conflict (e.g., accommodating biased base\ncomposition, high homoplasy, within- and among-site rate variation,\netc.) are largely unsuccessful. Key Words: molecular phylogeny;\nSalticidae; cytochrome oxidase; incongruence; homoplasy; sequence\nalignment; secondary structure; ribosomal DNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7b","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5578.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7a","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5577.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7c","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7d","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendryphantinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5582.phy"}]}
