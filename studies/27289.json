The origin of D. yakusilvicola is not a hybrid between D.\nsparsavar. sparsa and D. sabaei, but the parents appear to have been\nundetected species closely related to D. melanocarpa var . elegansand D.\nsabaei. Analysis of additional species of the D. sparsa complex around\nSoutheast Asia and additional nuclear markers areneeded to clarify the\nrelationships of this complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dryopteris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dryopteris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130638.phy"}]}
