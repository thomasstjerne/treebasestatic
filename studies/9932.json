Therefore, L. doliiformis is transferred to Micarea [M.\ndoliiformis (Coppins & P. James) Coppins & Sérus.], and a new\nname is introduced for the transfer of C. alba into Biatora (B.\nveteranorum Coppins & Sérus. nom. nov.). Biatora ligni-mollis,\nrecently described from primary forests in British Columbia (Canada), is\nshown to be a rare but widespread species in Western Europe (Belgium,\nFrance, Germany, Poland and Scotland) where it is not confined to\nundisturbed forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecidea doliiformis, MP Bootstrap 1000 replicates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6418.phy"}]}
