Phytophthora stricta represents a\npreviously unknown clade in the rRNA internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS)-based phylogeny. Phytophthora macilentosa, along with nine other\nspecies, consistently forms a high temperature-tolerant cluster within\nITS clade 9. These observations are supported by the sequence analysis\nof the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene. Both species are\nheterothallic and all examined isolates are A1 mating type. Phytophthora\nstricta produces nonpapillate and slightly caducous sporangia. This\nspecies is named after its characteristic constrictions on\nsporangiophores. Phytophthora macilentosa produces nonpapillate and\nnoncaducous sporangia, which are mostly elongated obpyriform with a high\nlength to breadth ratio. Both species were recovered from irrigation\nwater of an ornamental plant nursery in Mississippi, USA and P. stricta\nwas also recovered from stream water in Virginia, USA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64894.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64893.phy"}]}
