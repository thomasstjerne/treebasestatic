We\ntest this hypothesis by estimating rates of speciation, extinction, and\ntransition between sexuality and functional asexuality in the evening\nprimroses. Specifically, we estimate these rates using the recently\ndeveloped BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) phylogenetic\ncomparative method, which employs maximum likelihood and Bayesian\ntechniques. We infer that net diversification rates (speciation minus\nextinction) in functionally asexual evening primrose lineages are\nroughly eight times faster than diversification rates in sexual\nlineages, largely due to higher speciation rates in asexual lineages. We\nfurther reject the hypothesis that a loss of recombination and\nsegregation is irreversible because the transition rate from functional\nasexuality to sexuality is significantly greater than zero.and in fact\nexceeded the reverse rate. These results provide the first empirical\nevidence in support of the alternative theoretical prediction that\nasexual populations should instead diversify more rapidly than sexual\npopulations because they are free from the homogenizing effects of\nsexual recombination and segregation. Although asexual reproduction may\noften constrain adaptive evolution, our results show that the loss of\nrecombination and segregation need not be an evolutionary dead-end in\nterms of diversification of lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 99","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evening Primroses","tree_kind":"Species
