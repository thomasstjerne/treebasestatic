Eight species from\nthis genus are currently recognised, of which five have been reported\npreviously in South Africa, namely C. camelliae, C. elegans, C.\nlageniformis, C. parva, and C. peruviana. In a recent survey of\nsoilborne diseases of nursery grapevines in the Western Cape province of\nSouth Africa, various isolates of Cylindrocladiella were obtained from a\nnewly established 99-Richter mother block exhibiting decline symptoms.\nThe DNA phylogeny of these and additional isolates, also obtained from\ndeclining grapevines, was determined by sequencing the ITS (ITS1, ITS2\nand 5.8S) as well as ÃŸ-tubulin and histone H3 gene regions. Results from\nthis study revealed that four species of Cylindrocladiella occur on\ngrapevines in South Africa, namely C. lageniformis, C. parva, C.\nperuviana, as well as a new species described here as C. viticola, which\nforms part of the C. infestans species complex. Pathogenicity trials,\nusing stem inoculations on green and one-year-old 99-Richter cuttings\nwere conducted to determine the pathogenicity of selected isolates of\nthese species, but these results were inconclusive.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"One of 16 MPTs from the combined ITS, b-tubulin and\nhistone sequence alignment.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4469.phy"}]}
