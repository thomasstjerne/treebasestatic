This study aimed to identify the species associated\nwith black-foot disease in young grapevines in vineyards of China.\nFungal isolates were identified as Campylocarpon fasciculare, based on\nboth morphological and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of ITS, tef1α\nand ß-tubulin sequence data. For the first time from China, we report\nCampylocarpon fasciculare from symptomatic young grapevines. Kochs\npostulates were performed on Vitis vinifera cv. Summer Black (SB) in a\ngreenhouse and confirmed the pathogenicity on grapevines. This work\nimproves the knowledge of black-foot disease in Chinese vineyards and\nwill be helpful to growers in their decisions regarding vinicultural\npractices, planting and disease management","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132009","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132009.phy"}]}
