We considered our best tree to be the one\nconstructed using all of our data, assembled under the parsimony\ncriterion, with stems of the few strongly incongruent nodes collapsed.\nData on the presence or absence of floral nectaries, pollinator orders,\nsuperfamilies and families, pollination systems and functional numbers\nof flowers per plant were mapped onto our best tree using maximum\nparsimony and where possible, maximum likelihood criteria. The results\nof our character mapping analyses suggest that the most recent common\nancestor of the Diurideae was pollinated by bees that were deceptively\ninduced to visit its nectarless flowers by their resemblance to flowers\nthat provided nectar and/or pollen rewards. Species and their\ndescendants that attracted pollinators by offering nectar or the false\npromise of sex, or that dispensed with cross-pollination altogether,\nevolved multiple times from such ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66391.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66389.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66388","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66388.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66387.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66392.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66390.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66386.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66385.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66384.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66393.phy"}]}
