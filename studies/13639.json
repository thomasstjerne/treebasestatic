The genera evaluated\nincluded Bankera herein reduced to synonym with Phellodon, Hydnellum,\nSarcodon, and Phellodon. Basidiomata of many stipitate hydnum species\nfrom this region were abundant but nitrogen depositions during the last\n20 years have impacted their occurrences. Therefore it became critical\nto do a definitive study of these fungi using current taxonomic tools.\nMany species within Hydnellum and Phellodon have a indeterminate type\ngrowth often dependant on environmental conditions making discrimination\nbetween closely related species difficult without supportive molecular\nsequence data. Once sequence data (ITS) was obtained a phylogenetic\nanalyzes was conducted and the sequences were compared to those in\nGenBank with particular attention to European data. A total of 41\ndistinct taxa were determined and many of those were confirmed based on\nmorphological data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS majority rule tree with posterior\nprobabilities","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62228.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS majority rule tree","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62229.phy"}]}
