They have been the focus of\nintense behavioral ecological research since the 1980s and the New World\nfauna was taxonomically revised in the 1980s. Here, with new molecular,\necological, reproductive incompatability, and morphological data, we\nreport the discovery that N. vespilloides in most of North America,\nexcept Alaska+Yukon+Northwest Territories, is not conspecific with Old\nWorld N. vespilloides. DNA barcode data split this species into two\nBINs, each shows different habitat preferences, most larvae from hybrid\ncrosses fail to reach four days of age, and diagnostic characters were\nfound on the epipleuron and metepisternum that help to separate the\nspecies. The oldest available name for this other North American\npopulation is Nicrophorus hebes Kirby, 1837, which we now treat as valid\n(new status). This study brings the New World total to 22 species for\nthe genus, and given the rarity of N. hebes, and its tight association\nwith wetlands, justifies further investigation into its conservation\nstatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nicrophorus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98894.phy"}]}
