They along with G. fusipes (sect. Gymnopus) form a\ndistinct clade with high support, although their macromorphological\ncharacters seem to be closer to members of Gymnopus sect. Levipedes or\nsect. Vestipedes (Marasmiellus s. str.). When examined in detail, their\nmicromorphological charactersespecially the type of pileipellissupport\nthem as new members of G. sect. Gymnopus. Therefore, two new species, G.\nomphalinoides and G. schizophyllus, and the emendated circumscription of\nsect. Gymnopus are proposed in this paper. Detailed morphological\ndescriptions, colour photos, illustrations of the two new species,\nmorphological comparisons with similar taxa and their\nmolecular-phylogenetic analyses of the combined nrITS and nrLSU data are\npresented. A key to the known species of G. sect. Gymnopus is also\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133555.phy"}]}
