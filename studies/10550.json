As lectotype the\nVittadini’s Fig. XII E/Tab. IV (from Monographia Tuberacearum) was\nselected. The epitype chosen for A. rubescens is a recent large\ncollection from Liguria (Italy). Furthermore to investigate the\nphylogenetic position of A. rubescens among Alpova spp. comparative\n28S-rDNA gene sequence analyses were conducted. The new combination\nRhizopogon alexsmithii (Trappe) Vizzini & Zotti is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Agaricomycetes 28S con 50 majru","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9377 (Fig. 3 mb)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9377.phy"},{"tree_label":"Alpova 28S nj","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9378 (Fig. 4 nj)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9378.phy"}]}
