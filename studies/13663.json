Here we report and\ngenetically characterize the nascent invasion of Puerto Rico by an\nexotic constricting snake of the family Boidae (Boa constrictor) using\nmtDNA and microsatellite data. Over 150 individual B. constrictor have\nbeen removed from Mayag√ºez municipality since May 2011, and our results\nfrom the genetic analysis of 32 individuals suggest that this population\nwas recently founded by individuals of one subspecies from a genetic\nlineage common to zoo and breeding collections, but that the potential\npropagule pool consists of two subspecies. We also suggest that\nanthropogenic long-distance dispersal within the island of Puerto Rico\nmay be occurring from the established population, with implications for\nfurther establishment across the island. This study represents the first\nreport of the naturalization of an invasive species of boid snake in\nPuerto Rico and will be important in determining mitigation strategies\nfor this invasion as well as providing a basis for comparison to other\non-going studies of invasive snakes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boa constrictors","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59078.phy"}]}
