Based on\nits transversely septate, brown conidia, the presence of paraphyses, and\npercurrent proliferation of the conidiogenous cells, the genus resembles\nStilbospora (Melanoconidaceae, Diaporthales). It is distinct in having\npycnidial condiomata, conidia lacking mucoid sheaths, and becoming\nmuriform when mature. Its morphology and phylogenetic placement based on\nanalyses of sequence data for the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA\ngene (LSU, 28S) as well as the ITS and 5.8S rRNA gene of the nrDNA\noperon, show that Homortomyces represents a novel genus in\nDothideomycetes, although its familial relationships remain\nunresolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homortomyces gen. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59566.phy"}]}
