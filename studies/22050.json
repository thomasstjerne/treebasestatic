The\nmonophyly of the tribe is well established, but the recent finding that\na species previously described in Iochroma (also Solanaceae) belongs in\nDatureae calls for a reassessment of the tribeÂ’s circumscription. Here we\nestimated the phylogeny of Datureae, including all of its 18 species,\nusing three nuclear regions, and incorporated fossil information to\nestimate divergence times. Based on this phylogeny, we reconstructed the\nevolution of key aspects of reproductive morphology and life history to\nidentify diagnostic features. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses\nsuggest that the diversification of Datureae began roughly ca. 35 Ma,\naround the beginning of the Andean uplift. Within the tribe, Datura and\nBrugmansia are monophyletic sister taxa and the misplaced species of\nIochroma is sister to the remaining species. Based on our morphological\nanalysis, we describe the latter as a new monotypic genus Trompettia.\nAncestral state reconstructions identify diagnostic features for each of\nthe three genera and show a large suite of changes along the Datura\nbranch, including the evolution of erect flowers, capsular fruit, and\nannual life history. Using these features, we formally re-circumscribe\nDatureae to include all genera and their species and provide a taxonomic\nkey for the tribe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Datureae MCC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109204.phy"}]}
