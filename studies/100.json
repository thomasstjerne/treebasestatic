In the main analysis (all Myrtales\nas outgroup), seven equally parsimonious cladograms were produced, each\nwith 29 steps and a consistency index of 0.82. A successive weighting\nprocedure was applied, resulting in six cladograms with a consistency\nindex of 0.93. All cladograms share the following nine monophyletic\ngroups: 1) all taxa except Ludwigia; 2) Circaea (Fuchsia-Lopezia); 3)\nFuchsia-Lopezia; 4) Gayophytum (Epilobium-Boisduvalia)\n(Gongylocarpus-Xylonagra-Camissonia(Clarkia(Hauya-Calylophus-Gaura))\n(Oenothera-Stenosiphon)); 5) Epilobium-Boisduvalia; 6)\nGongylocarpus-Xylonagra-Camissonia(Clarkia(Hauya-Calylophus-\nGaura))(Oenothera-Stenosiphon); 7) Clarkia(Hauya-Calylophus-Gaura); 8)\nHauya-Calylophus-Gaura; and 9) Oenothera-Stenosiphon. One additional\nmonophyletic group appears after applying the successive weighting\nprocedure: Gayophytum (Epilobium-Boisduvalia). Results of the cladistic\nanalysis support a sister group relationship of Ludwigia to the rest of\nthe genera. The clade of Circaea, Fuchsia, and Lopezia is the sister\ngroup of the remaining genera (except Ludwigia), but there is relatively\nless resolution of the relationships among those genera (the tribes\nOnagreae, Epilobieae, and Hauyeae). The other main conclusions are that\nthe positions of Hauya and Gayophytum are problematic and not well\nresolved, and that the tribe Onagreae may be paraphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1336.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1337.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1339.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1338.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1E","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1340.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1F","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1341.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1G","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1342.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1H","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1343.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1333.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1334.phy"}]}
