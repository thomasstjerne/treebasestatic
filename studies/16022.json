In molecular phylogenetic studies all four\ndescribed species of Wallaceina were shown to be extremely close to each\nother and to some other undescribed isolates or even species attributed\nto the different genus (Blastocrithidia) clustered within Leishmaniinae\nclade. Recent inclusion of unrelated species from “Leptomonas collosoma\nclade” led to further confusion. To clarify this situation we performed\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis of the available isolates of supposed\nWallaceina species. Our results demonstrated that all\nLeishmaniinae-bound wallaceinas are just different isolates of the same\nspecies that we are proposing to rename back to its original name of\nCrithidia brevicula Frolov, Malysheva, 1989. Here we also propose to\ndiscontinue using the generic name Wallaceina and rename the recently\nemended genus Wallaceina Podlipaev, Frolov et Kolesnikov, 1999, emend.\nVotýpka, Yurchenko et Luke, 2014 into Wallacemonas Kostygov et\nYurchenko, 2014.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 (extra)","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of isolates studied in this work\ninferred by maximum likelihood method using 18S rRNA + gGAPDH\nconcatenated set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75891.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor-joining dendrogram of gGAPDH gene\nsequences","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor-joining dendrogram of SL RNA gene sequences of\nLeishmaniinae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75889.phy"},{"tree_label":"not shown in the article","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor-joining dendrogram of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 gene\nsequences","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of isolates studied in this work\ninferred by maximum likelihood method using 18S rRNA + gGAPDH\nconcatenated set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75892.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 (extra)","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of isolates studied in this work\ninferred by maximum likelihood method using 18S rRNA + gGAPDH\nconcatenated set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75890.phy"}]}
