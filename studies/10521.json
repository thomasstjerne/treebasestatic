Parasitoids are important regulators of\narthropod populations, including major agricultural pests and disease\nvectors, and Nasonia is an emerging genetic model, particularly for\nevolutionary and developmental genetics. Key findings include the\nidentification of a functional DNA methylation tool kit;\nhymenopteran-specific genes including diverse venoms; lateral gene\ntransfers among Pox viruses, Wolbachia, and Nasonia; and the rapid\nevolution of genes involved in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions that\nare implicated in speciation. Newly developed genome resources advance\nNasonia for genetic research, accelerate mapping and cloning of\nquantitative trait loci, and will ultimately provide tools and knowledge\nfor further increasing the utility of parasitoids as pest insect-control\nagents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PRANC domain proteins in Nasonia, Pox viruses, and\nWolbachia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9286.phy"}]}
