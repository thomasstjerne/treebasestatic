The protocol involves the release of DNA from spores, PCR\namplification to enrich Tilletia-specific templates from released DNA\nand a 5-plex real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect, identify\nand distinguish T. indica in wheat grains as well as some other Tilletia\nspecies (T. walkeri, T. ehrhartae, T. horrida and a group comprising T.\ncaries, T. laevis, T. contraversa, T. bromi and T. fusca). This\nfluorescent molecular tool has a detection sensitivity of 1 spore and\nthus bypasses the germination step, which in the current protocol is\nrequired for confirmation when only a few spores have been found in\ngrain samples. The assay contains five dual-labelled species-specific\nprobes and associated species-specific primer pairs in a PCR mix in one\ntube. The different amplification products are quantitated and\nidentified simultaneously by 5 different fluorescence spectra. This\nspecific and sensitive assay with reduced labour and reagent\nrequirements makes it an effective and economically sustainable tool to\nbe used in a Karnal bunt surveillance program. This protocol will also\nbe valuable for assessment of the level of some contaminant Tilletia in\nwheat grains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tilletia indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5449.phy"}]}
