Since then the number of families has\nincreased as a result of the transfer of one family (Planistromellaceae)\ninto the order, re-instatement of another (Phyllostictaceae), while\nothers resulted from raising genera to family status\n(Endomelanconiopsisaceae, Melanonopsaceae, Pseudofusicoccumaceae,\nSaccharataceae and Septorioideaceae). All these decisions were based\nsolely on phylogenetic analyses of several different loci. There has\nbeen no consensus on which loci are suitable markers at this taxonomic\nlevel and in some cases the datasets used to construct the phylogenies\nwere incomplete. In this paper, the families of Botryosphaeriales were\nre-assessed in terms of morphology of the sexual morphs, phylogenetic\nrelationships based on ITS and LSU sequence data, and evolutionary\ndivergence times of lineages in relation to major events in the\nevolution of their hosts on a geological timescale. Six main lineages\nwere resolved in the phylogenetic analyses and these correspond to six\ngroups as defined on morphology of the sexual morphs. These lineages\nevolved during the Late epoch of the Cretaceous period and survived the\ncatastrophic event that led to the mass extinction of non-avian\ndinosaurs and a great loss of plant diversity at the end of the\nCretaceous period. They then diversified during the Paleocene and Eocene\nepochs of the Paleogene period. These six lineages are considered to\nrepresent families in Botryosphaeriales. Therefore, six families\n(Aplosporellaceae, Botryosphaeriaceae, Melanopsaceae, Phyllostictaceae,\nPlanistromellaceae and Saccharataceae) are accepted in\nBotryosphaeriales, while three (Endomelanconiopsisaceae,\nPseudofusicoccumaceae and Septorioideaceae) are regarded as superfluous\nand reduced to synonymy under existing families.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_24","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113939","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113939.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_25","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113940","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113940.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_26","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113941","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113941.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_27","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113942","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113942.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_28","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113943","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113943.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_29","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113944","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113944.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1000","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113945","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113945.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE2","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evolutionary
