Proceratosaurus\nis an unusual theropod with markedly enlarged external nares and a\ncranial crest starting at the premaxillaryÂ–nasal junction. The skull is\nhighly pneumatic, with pneumatized nasals, jugals, and maxillae, as well\nas a highly pneumatic braincase, featuring basisphenoid, anterior\ntympanic, basipterygoid, and carotid recesses. The dentition is unusual,\nwith small premaxillary teeth and much larger lateral teeth, with a\npronounced size difference of the serrations between the mesial and\ndistal carina. The first dentary tooth is somewhat procumbent and flexed\nanteriorly. Phylogenetic analysis places Proceratosaurus in the\nTyrannosauroidea, in a monophyletic clade Proceratosauridae, together\nwith the Oxfordian Chinese taxon Guanlong. The Bathonian age of\nProceratosaurus extends the origin of all clades of basal coelurosaurs\nback into the Middle Jurassic, and provides evidence for an early,\nLaurasia-wide, dispersal of the Tyrannosauroidea during the late Middle\nto Late Jurassic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 23","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55857.phy"}]}
