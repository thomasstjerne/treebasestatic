Using\nmorphological and molecular data (ITS nrDNA and rpb2 markers), we\nconfirm that some specimens under A. laevigatum from Japan belong to A.\norientale, a species described from China. Amylostereum orientale\ndiffers from A. laevigatum mainly in their smaller spores. This is the\nfirst citation of A. orientale in Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99617","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99617.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99618","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99618.phy"}]}
