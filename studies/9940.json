Lactarius dewevrei is strikingly characterised by the entire\nblackish to dark date brown basidiomata and winged basidiospores with\nbroad branched ridges of Plinthogali type, and Russula caeruleoanulata\nis distinguished by the uniformly pastel yellow color, a blue line at\nthe stem apex as well as the bluing of injured surfaces of the stem.\nDNA-based phylogenetic placement of the new species was assessed using\nnucleotide sequences of the partial nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA\n(nucLSU rDNA). Molecular analyses supported the placement of R.\ncaeruleoanulata in R. delica-R. brevipes group of Russula subg. Compacta\nsect. Compactae, but did not afford a clear-cut placement of L.\ndewevrei, rather closely related to Lactarius subg. Plinthogali and also\nsubg. Lactariopsis, while BLAST analyses showed similarity with subgs.\nLactariopsis, Piperites and Russularia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mpt","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russula-Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6113.phy"}]}
