All the specimens preserve the\nskulls as well as, in some cases, mandibles, postcrania, and osteoderm.\nThey are not taphonomically deformed by expanding matrix distortion,\nunlike many Gobi specimens, including the holotype of P. grangeri. Bayan\nMandahu is also the type locality for Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. The\nproximity in space and time of these two closely related species\nwarrants a generic and specific revision for Pinacosaurus. The\ndistinction of the two species is based on characters of the squamosal\ndermal elaborations, cranial roof posterior to the orbits, premaxillary\nnotch, and distal margin of the ilium. Although a relatively\nwell-represented ankylosaur taxon, the phylogenetic position of\nPinacosaurus has not been unequivocally resolved. A new analysis\nrecovers Pinacosaurus as the most basal member of the\nAnkylosaurinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Ankylosauria results","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ankylosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55290.phy"}]}
