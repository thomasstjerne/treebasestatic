Three soil-inhabiting,\nnamed as T. kunmingense, T. speciosum and T. zeloharzianum were\ndiscovered, described and illustrated. We summarized some analyses of\nmorphology and sequence data, including culture characteristic, features\nof asexual states, and phylogenetic inferences. Phylogenetic information\nwere obtained based on rDNA sequences of partial nucleotide translation\nelongation factor 1-α encoding gene (tef1) and the gene encoding the\nsecond largest nuc RNA polymerase subunit (rpb2). The result indicates\nthree new species respectively appeared as a separate terminal branch\nwith high statistical support. T. speciosum and T. kunmingense belong to\nViride clade, T. speciosum is related to three species  T. hispanicum,\nT. samuelsii and T. junci, and is characterized by tree-like\nconidiophores, paired branches, spindly and ampulliform phialides and\nsubglobose to globose conidia. T. kunmingense resemble T. asperellum and\nT.yunnanense, and is clearly distinctive by ampulliform and crowded\nphialides, mostly ellipsoidal conidia and pyramidal fashion\nconidiophores. T. zeloharzianum is a new member of green spored clade,\nand is associated with but differ from T. harzianum by crowded branches\nand conspicuous zonated formations of SNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113412.phy"}]}
