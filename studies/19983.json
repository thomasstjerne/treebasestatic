Forty-seven isolates were\nidentified as 9 species, which include a species new to Japan. M.\npingshaense was the most frequently isolated species among the isolates;\n23 isolates of them from insects of six orders (12 families) were\nidentified as this species. New host-pathogen combinations have been\nfound for two species with relatively narrow host ranges: Hymenoptera-M.\npemphigi and Orthoptera- and Phasmatodea-M. majus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Mani","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mfla","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101087.phy"}]}
