Previous cpDNA analyses of the\nAristolochia kaempferi group showed a distinct phylogeographic structure\nresulting from distributional changes brought about by paleo-climatic\noscillations. However, the cpDNA phylogeny was incongruent with\nmorphologically defined six taxa. To explore the evolutionary processes\nresponsible for the inconsistency between cpDNA and morphology,\nartificial crossings and phylogenetic analyses using multiple nuclear\nmarkers were performed. All crosses among different taxa or cpDNA clades\nset fruit, if crossing direction is not considered. The five nuclear\nphylogenies mostly did not support either the taxa or the cpDNA clades.\nA combined analysis of cpDNA and the PI exon revealed the two major\nlineages in the group, lacking a prezygotic isolating barrier between\nthem. However, an asymmetric prezygotic isolating barrier occurs between\npopulations of the Japanese main islands and of other areas, which\nbelong to different cpDNA subclades. It seems reasonable to conclude\nthat the development of a prezygotic isolating mechanism is not\nnecessarily proportional to the degree of genetic divergence. These\nresults suggested that species boundaries within the group are blurred\ndue to speciational processes associated with multiple hybridization and\nintrogression resulting from repeated contacts among differentiated\npopulations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PIexon","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1051.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PhyA","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1048.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PhyA","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1049.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PIexon","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1050.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 AP3 exon","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1045.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PI intron","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1053.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 AP3 exon","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1044.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 AP3 intron","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1046.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 AP3 intron","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 PI intron","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1052.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 cpDNA","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5191.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 cpDNA","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridizations in the Aristolochia kaempferi group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5192.phy"}]}
