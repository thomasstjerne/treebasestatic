{"Authors":" Jo M Wolfe, Thomas A Hegna","Year":" 2013","Title":" Testing the phylogenetic position of Cambrian pancrustacean\nlarval fossils by coding ontogenetic stages","Journal":" Cladistics","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Cambrian, Crustacea, Fossils, Larvae, Ontogeny, Orsten,\nPancrustacea, Semaphoront","DOI":"","Abstract":" The study of ontogeny as an integral part of understanding\nthe pattern of evolution dates back over 200 years, but only recently\nhave ontogenetic data been explicitly incorporated into phylogenetic\nanalyses. Pancrustaceans undergo radical ontogenetic changes. The\nspectacular upper Cambrian “Orsten” fauna preserves phosphatized fossil\nlarvae, including putative crown-group pancrustaceans with amazingly\ncomplete developmental sequences. The putative presence and nature of\nadult stages remains a source of debate, causing spurious placements in\na traditional morphological analysis. We introduce a new coding method\nwhere each semaphoront (discrete larval or adult stage) is considered an\noperational taxonomic unit. This avoids a priori assumptions of\nheterochrony. Characters and their states are defined to identify\nchanges in morphology throughout ontogeny. Phylogenetic analyses of\nsemaphoronts produced possible relationships of each Orsten fossil to\nthe crown-group clade expected from morphology shared with extant\nlarvae. Bredocaris is a member of the stem lineage of Thecostraca or\n(Thecostraca + Copepoda), and Yicaris and Rehbachiella are probably\nmembers of the stem lineage of Cephalocarida. These placements rely\ndirectly on comparisons between extant and fossil larval character\nstates. The position of Phosphatocopina remains unresolved. This method\nmay have broader applications to other phylogenetic problems which may\nrely on ontogenetically variable homology statements.","trees":[{"tree_label":"implied3
