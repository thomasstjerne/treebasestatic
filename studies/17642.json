The Pentatomoidea superfamily is\neconomically important and the largest superfamily within\nPentatomomorpha with over 7,000 species. To better understand the\ndiversity and evolution of pentatomoid species, we sequenced and\nannotated the mitogenomes of Eurydema gebleri and Rubiconia intermedia,\nand present the first comparative analysis of the 11 pentatomoid\nmitogenomes that have been sequenced to date. Results We obtained the\ncomplete mitogenome of Eurydema gebleri (16,005 bp) and a nearly\ncomplete mitogenome of Rubiconia intermedia (14,967 bp). Our results\nshow that gene content, gene arrangement, base composition, codon usage,\nand mitochondrial transcription termination factor sequences are highly\nconserved in pentatomoid species, especially for species in the same\nfamily. Evolutionary rate analyses of protein-coding genes reveal that\nthe highest and lowest rates are found in atp8 and cox1 and distinctive\nevolutionary patterns are significantly correlated with the G+C content\nof genes. We inferred the secondary structures for two rRNA genes for\neleven pentatomoid species, and identify some conserved motifs of RNA\nstructures in Pentatomidea. All tRNA genes in pentatomoid mitogenomes\nhave a canonical cloverleaf secondary structure, except for two tRNAs\n(trnS1 and trnV) which appear to lack the dihydrouridine arm. Regions\nthat are A+T-rich have several distinct characteristics (e.g.Â size\nvariation and abundant tandem repeats), and have potential as species or\npopulation level molecular markers. Phylogenetic analyses based on\nmitogenomic data strongly support the monophyly of Pentatomoidea, and\nthe estimated phylogenetic relationships are: (Urostylididae +\n(Plataspidae + (Pentatomidae + (Cydnidae + (Dinidoridae +\nTessaratomidae))))). Conclusions This comparative mitogenomic analysis\nsheds light on the architecture and evolution of mitogenomes in the\nsuperfamily Pentatomoidea. Mitogenomes can be effectively used to\nresolve phylogenetic relationships of pentatomomorphan insects at\nvarious taxonomic levels. Sequencing more mitogenomes at various\ntaxonomic levels, particularly from closely related species, will\nimprove the annotation accuracy of mitochondrial genes, as well as\ngreatly enhance our understanding of mitogenomic evolution and\nphylogenetic relationships in pentatomoids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PCG123_BI tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG123_BI tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87807.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG12_rrnL_tRNA_ML tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pentatomoidea PCG12 rrnL tRNA MLT","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87806.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG12_ML tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG12_ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87804.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG12_BI tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pentatomoidea PCG12_BI tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87803.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG12_rrnL_tRNA_BI tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG12_rrnL_tRNA_BI tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87805.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG123_RNA_BI tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG123_RNA_BI tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87809.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG123_ML tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG123_ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87808.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG123_RNA_ML tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PCG123_RNA_ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87810.phy"}]}
