We used a robust\npolyphasic approach to describe a new biological species, Fusarium\ntemperatum sp. nov., within the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex. By\nusing AFLP fingerprint profile, differences in the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha and beta-tubulin DNA sequence, and\ninterspecies mating compatibility analyses, F. temperatum can be\ndistinguished from F. subglutinans and from the other Fusarium species\nwithin the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex. Intraspecies mating\ncompatibility suggests that sexual reproduction may be common for field\nisolates of F. temperatum and reliable female fertile mating population\ntester strains were proposed for this heterothallic species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20811.phy"}]}
