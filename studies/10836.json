In the present study, fungal\nisolates from cankered apple and pear bark were examined and compared\nusing morphology and rDNA-ITS sequences. Valsa mali was confirmed to be\nan independent species and a causal pathogen of Valsa canker on apple\nand pear in China. It was the predominant species (96.7% of isolates) on\napple and was complemented by V. malicola (3.3% of isolates).\nSignificant intraspecific genetic differentiation was detected in V.\nmali with two varieties recognized: V. mali var. mali occurring\nexclusively on apple and V. mali var. pyri occuring on both apple and\npear. Results from genetic analysis and cross-inoculation tests provided\nsupport for the hypothesis that host preference probably catalyzed such\ngenetic changes within the pathogen populations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21402.phy"}]}
