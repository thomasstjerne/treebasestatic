The morphological studies included eleven species L.\ncyrtella, L. cyrtellina, L. dubitans, L. erysibe, L. hutchinsiae, L.\nleprosa, L. madida, L. prasinoides, L. sambucina, L. sordida, and L.\nsylvestris, and a key to the species plus species descriptions are\nprovided. Lecania madida, a new species from the Pacific Northwest of\nAmerica, L. leprosa, a new species from Eastern Europe, and L. sordida,\na new species from Europe, are described here, and the known range\nextension of L. prasinoides is greatly expanded to include the Baltic\ncountries, the Nordic countries, and Western Canada. Lectotypes are\ndesignated for L. cyrtella and L. sambucina. The molecular relationships\nwithin the group were examined utilizing haplotype network estimations\nand phylogenetic reconstructions. Part of the IGS region as well as the\ncomplete ITS region were sequenced and analyzed. Both the haplotype\nnetwork and the phylogenetic analyses indicate that the included\nspecies, as conceived in the morphological examinations, all are\nmonophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"All Taxa","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecania cyrtella group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2932.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecania cyrtella group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2933.phy"}]}
