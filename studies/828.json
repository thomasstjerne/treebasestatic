The two data sets, though not significantly incongruent,\nexhibit conflict among the placement of two taxa that exhibit long\nbranches in the nLSU data set. In contrast, RPB1 terminal branch lengths\nare rather uniform. Bootstrap support is increased for clades in RPB1.\nCombined data sets increase the degree of confidence for several\nrelationships. Overall, nLSU data do not yield a robust phylogeny when\nindependently assessed by RPB1 sequences. This multigene study indicates\nthat Inocybe is a monophyletic group composed of at least four distinct\nlineages—subgenus Mallocybe, section Cervicolores, section Rimosae, and\nsubgenus Inocybe sensu Kühner, Kuyper, non Singer. Within subgenus\nInocybe, two additional lineages, one composed of species with smooth\nbasidiospores (clade I) and a second characterized by nodulose-spored\nspecies (clade II), are recovered by RPB1 and combined data. The nLSU\ndata recover only clade I. The genera Astrosporina and Inocybella cannot\nbe recognized phylogenetically. “Supersections” Cortinatae and\nMarginatae are not monophyletic groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4(b)","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3966.phy"}]}
