This fungus infects many host plants in Southeast Asia and\ncauses severe leaf blight disease of eucalypts. Calonectria\nquinqueseptata Figueiredo & Namek., which was described from leaf\nspots on Annona squamosa L. from Brazil, has been regarded as the\nteleomorph of Cy. quinqueseptatum. Based on morphology and on the\nphylogeny derived from the DNA sequence of a ß-tubulin gene portion\nspanning several phylogenetically informative introns, the two\nrespective ex-type cultures are shown to be distinct species.\nFurthermore, Calonectria reteaudii (Bugn.) C. Booth (anamorph Cy.\nreteaudii (Bugn.) Boesew.), which was described on Smithia bequaertii De\nWild. from Vietnam, is shown to be morphologically identical to a\ncomprehensive selection of isolates of Cy. quinqueseptatum from\nSoutheast Asia, Australia, and Madagascar. As Cy. reteaudii represents\nan older name for Cy. quinqueseptatum, we suggest that the fungus\ncausing widespread damage on eucalypts and other hosts in the above\nregions be referred to as Cy. reteaudii. Calonectria quinqueseptata\nshould be retained for the fungus that thus far has been found only in\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocladium quinqueseptatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3850.phy"}]}
