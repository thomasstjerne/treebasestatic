New study of NMSG SAO 251093 (a\nspecimen referred to Thalassodromeus sethi) suggests it is a previously\nunknown species of dsungaripterid, Banguela oberlii, tax. nov.,\ndiffering from Thalassodromeus and other pterosaurs from the Early\nCretaceous of Brazil by a unique combination of characters, including an\nupturned jaw tip, a short dorsal mandibular symphyseal shelf (dmss), and\nan autapomorphic thin crest placed halfway along the fused mandibular\nsymphysis without a keel along the ventral margin of the jaw. B.\noberlii, tax. nov., is referred to Dsungaripteridae based on a dmss no\nlonger than the ventral shelf, U-shaped caudal margin of the ventral\nshelf and lateral margins of the mandibular symphysis concave in dorsal\nview. B. oberlii, tax. nov., is the youngest known dsungaripterid, and\nexpands known morphological diversity in the clade as well as the Early\nCretaceous pterosaur fauna of South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74827","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74827.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
