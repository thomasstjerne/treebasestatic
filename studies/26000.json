Euonymus\nalatus dieback came out by members of Cytospora and it has become one of\nthe most severe diseases affecting the cultivation of E. alatus in\nChina. In this study, we examined the causal agent of bough dieback of\ncampuses of University Road, Beijing, China. Amongst the strains, three\nof them were morphologically consistent with Cytospora showing hyaline\nand allantoid conidia. Based on phylogenetic analyses of the\nconcatenated ACT, ITS, RPB2, TEF1-α and TUB2 gene sequences along with\nmorphological characteristics, we are proposing C. haidianensis as a\nnovel species. It was confirmed as causal agent of dieback on E. alatus\nby pathogenicity tests. Mycelial growth of C. haidianensis occurred at\npH values ranging from 3.0 to 11.0, with an optimum growth at 8.3, and\nat temperatures from 5 to 35 °C, with an optimum growth at 19.8 °C. We\nalso tested the growth of C. haidianensis in the presence of six carbon\nsources. Sucrose, maltose and glucose were highly efficient and xylose\nwas the last one. The ability of C. haidianensis to grow at 19.8 °C may\nhelp to explain its occurrence causing dieback on E. alatus in Beijing\nduring the autumn season.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"192","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora haidianensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124325.phy"}]}
