BAMM analyses\nfound five significant rate shifts in Beslerieae, core Nematanthus, core\nColumneinae, core Streptocarpus, and Pacific Cyrtandra. These rate\nshifts correspond with shifts in diversification rates, as inferred by\nBiSSE and GeoSSE, associated with hummingbird pollination, epiphytism,\nunifoliate growth, and geographic area. Our results suggest that\ndiversification processes are extremely variable across Gesneriaceae\nclades with different combinations of characters influencing\ndiversification rates in different clades. Diversification patterns\nbetween New and Old World lineages show dramatic differences, suggesting\nthat the processes of diversification in Gesneriaceae are very different\nin these two geographic regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ATPBRBCLbs","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91362","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91362.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPBRBCL","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91361","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91361.phy"},{"tree_label":"5S","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91347","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91347.phy"},{"tree_label":"5Sbs","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91348","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91348.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPBbs","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91360","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91360.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPB","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91359","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91359.phy"},{"tree_label":"26Sbs","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91354","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91354.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSAbs","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91365","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91365.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSAbs","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91369.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSA","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91371.phy"},{"tree_label":"26S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91353.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSAbs","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91372","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91372.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSD","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91373","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91373.phy"},{"tree_label":"CHSDbs","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91374","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91374.phy"}]}
