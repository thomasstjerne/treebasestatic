In the\nhope of improving our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, we expanded\nsampling of taxa and genes beyond previous analyses. Methods: We\nconducted two primary analyses based on 640 species representing 330\nfamilies. The first included 25,260 aligned base pairs (bp) from 17\ngenes (representing all three plant genomes, i.e., nucleus, plastid, and\nmitochondrion). The second included 19,846 aligned bp from 13 genes\n(representing only the nucleus and plastid). Key Results: Many important\nquestions of deep-level relationships in the non-monocot angiosperms\nhave now been resolved with strong support. Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales,\nand Austrobaileyales are successive sisters to the remaining angiosperms\n(Mesangiospermae), which are resolved into Chloranthales + Magnoliidae\nas sister to Monocotyledoneae + [Ceratophyllaceae + Eudicotyledoneae].\nEudicotyledoneae contains a basal grade subtending Gunneridae. Within\nGunneridae, Gunnerales are sister to the remainder (Pentapetalae), which\ncomprises: 1) Superrosidae, consisting of Rosidae (including Vitaceae)\nand Saxifragales; and 2) Superasteridae, comprising Berberidopsidales,\nSantalales, Caryophyllales, Asteridae, and, based on this study,\nDilleniaceae (although other recent analyses disagree with this\nplacement). Within the major subclades of Pentapetalae most deep-level\nrelationships are resolved with strong support. Conclusions: Our\nanalyses confirm that with large amounts of sequence data, most\ndeep-level relationships within the angiosperms can be resolved. We\nanticipate that this well-resolved angiosperm tree will be of broad\nutility for many areas of biology, including physiology, ecology,\npaleobiology, and genomics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP
