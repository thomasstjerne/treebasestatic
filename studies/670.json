The age of onset of\npopulation subdivision appears to be about 200 thousand years ago. This\npredates the earliest modern human fossils, suggesting the\ntransformation to modern humans occurred in a subdivided population. The\nbase of the PDHA1 gene tree is relatively ancient, with an estimated age\nof 1.86 million years, a late Pliocene time associated with early\nspecies of Homo. PDHA1 revealed very low variation among non-Africans,\nbut in other respects the data are consistent with reports from other\nX-linked and autosomal haplotype data sets. Like these other genes, but\nin conflict with microsatellite and mitochondrial data, PDHA1 does not\nshow evidence of human population expansion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homo sapiens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3666.phy"}]}
