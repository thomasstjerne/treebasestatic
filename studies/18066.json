Results:\nThe results show high homology of NS nucleotide sequences of\nA/equine/Nador/1/1997 with European strains\n(i.e. A/equine/newmarket/2/93 and A/equine/Grobois/1/1998) and clustered\ninto the European lineage. However, NS gene of\nA/equine/Essaouira/2/2004(H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8)\nstrains indicated high homology with equine influenza strains that had\ncirculated before 1990 (A/equine/Fontainbleu/1/1979(H3N8), which\nbelonged to a pre-divergent phase Amino acid sequence comparison of the\nNS1 protein with reference strain A/equine/Miami/1963(H3N8) shows that\nthe A/equine/Nador/1/1997(H3N8) strain has 12 substitutions at the\nresidues D/24/N, R/44/K, S/48/I, R/67/Q, A/86/V, E/139/K, A/112/T,\nE/186/K, L/185/F, A/223/E, S/213/T and S/228/P. In both\nA/equine/Essaouira/2/2004(H3N8) and A/equine/Essaouira/3/2004(H3N8)\nstrains, the NS1 sequences present one common mutation at the residue:\nS/228/P. Conclusion: It seems that all of these substitutions are not\nproduced at the key residues of the RNA-binding domain (RBD) and the\neffector domain (ED). Consequently, we can suppose that they will not\naffect the potency of inhibition of cellular defences, and the virulence\nof the Moroccan equine strains will be maintained.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"54 nucleotide sequences of the NS gene of influenza A\nviruses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89416.phy"}]}
