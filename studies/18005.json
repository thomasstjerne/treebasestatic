The molecular data are from the partial\nlarge subunit and the complete internal transcribed regions of the\nribosomal DNA. These three species are characterized by the presence of\novoid to globose zoosporangia with papillae, internal proliferation as\nin Phytophthora and mode of zoospore discharge as in Pythium. All\nisolates showed high morphological and phylogenetic similarity with\nmembers of the Clades II and III of Phytopythium. In this paper,\nPhytopythium palingenes is included for the first time in a phylogenetic\nanalyses and our ITS and LSU phylogenies indicated that Aquaperonospora\ntaiwanensis is a synonym of Phytopythium helicoides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Tree","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytopythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89300.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytopythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89301.phy"}]}
