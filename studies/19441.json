Phylogenetic relationships within\nthe species remain unclear due to previous inconsistent results. In this\nstudy, we carried out phylogenetic analyses of Picea species using\nsequence variations from both plastome and nuclear genome from 26\nspecies/varieties, including 16 from China, two from Europe, and eight\nfrom North America. Our genome phylogenies indicate that the deepest\nsplits among surviving spruce lineages occurred in North America. Four\nmajor clades, comprising two to nine species/varieties each, were\nconsistently recovered across all phylogenies. Plastome and nuclear\ngenome phylogenies contradict each other with respect to inter-clade\nrelationships, mainly in the placements of the North American P.\nsitchensis and a clade comprising P. pungens, P. rubens and P. mariana.\nThese contradictions could mainly be the result of introgression of the\nnuclear or chloroplast genomes from locally and adjacently distributed\nspecies. However, incomplete lineage sorting and frequent interspecific\ngene flow may, together, have contributed to further inconsistent\nphylogenetic relationships between the closely related species within\ntwo Eurasian clades. All these findings suggest evolutionary complexity\nduring diversification of the genus Picea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96664.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96667","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96667.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96668.phy"}]}
