This species\nwas recovered during intensive studies on the distribution and ecology\nof fungi and myxomycetes in tropical forests of Vietnam in the context\nof a long-term project Ecolan 1.2. The morphology of representative\nspecimens was examined by light and scanning electron microscopy, and\nmicrographs of relevant details are provided. D. dalatense has unique\ncombination of morphological characters of the sporocarps among species\nof Diderma including very small (0.2Â–0.4 mm in diam.) dark-yellow,\nglobose to subglobose sessile sporocarps, large conical or subglobose\nyellow columella, smooth peridium with three layers resembling that of\nLeocarpus and irregularly warted spores. In addition to the\nmorphological description, partial sequences of three genetic markers of\nthis new species (SSU, EF1A, COI) were obtained and submitted to\nGenBank. The stability of the taxonomic characters of the species was\nconfirmed by several collections obtained in different localities of the\nnational park.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diderma 18S rDNA + EF1A + COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118957.phy"}]}
