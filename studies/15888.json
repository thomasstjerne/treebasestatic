The present study developed a phylogenetic hypothesis\nbased on macro- and micromorphology, and tested the monophyly of the\ngenus and subgenera, as well as the position of P. feliciana. The\nterminal taxa were 67 species of Pitcairnia and 12 outgroup taxa. These\ntaxa were selected to represent the morphological diversity and areas of\nendemism of Bromeliaceae. The results supported the monophyly of\nPitcairnia, supported by two non-homoplastic and five homoplastic\nsynapomorphies. Moreover, Pitcairnia subgenus Pepinia and Pitcairnia\nsubgenus Pitcairnia do not form a monophyletic group. Pitcairnia\nfeliciana emerged as related to the Atlantic Forest taxa. The\nphylogenetic relationships among the species recorded in the three\nBrazilian domains (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Amazon) were clarified,\nand the relationships showed that the members of Pitcairnia occupied the\nthree Brazilian domains though several routes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75620","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75620.phy"}]}
