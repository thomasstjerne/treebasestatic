Xerulina was often treated as a separate genus by some\nmycologists. In this study, collections of Cyptotrama from East Asia,\nSoutheast Asia, and South Asia were studied. For comparison, materials\nfrom North America and New Zealand were analysed. Our multi-gene\nphylogenetic analyses indicated that Cyptotrama is monophyletic and\nXerulina should be treated as a section within the ge- nus Cyptotrama.\nDifferent scenarios of morphological character evolution in Cyptotrama\nare discovered. A total of seven species of Cyptotrama can be recognized\nfrom Asia, three of which, Cyptotrama angustispora, C. glabra, and C.\nshennongjia, are new to science. Mean- while, three taxa previously\nplaced in Xerulina or Marasmius were proved to be members of Cyptotrama,\nand the new combinations, namely Cyptotrama trogioides, C. megaspora,\nand C. myochroa, are accordingly proposed. A key for the diagnosis of\nworldwide Cyptotrama species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyptotrama tub723 ITS 1675 LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95269.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyptotrama LSU ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95268.phy"}]}
