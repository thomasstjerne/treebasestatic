Here we evaluate the phylogenetic\npotential of five different markers for resolving evolutionary\nrelationships within the ectoparasitic genus Dermanyssus at the species\nlevel, and their ability to address questions about the evolution of\nspecialization. COI provided 918% divergence between species (up to 9%\nwithin species), 16S rRNA 1016% (up to 4% within species), ITS1 and 2\n29% (up to 1% within species) and Tropomyosin intron n 820% (up to 6%\nwithin species). EF-1 revealed different non-orthologous copies within\nindividuals of Dermanyssus and Ornithonyssus. Tropomyosin intron n was\nshown containing consistent phylogenetic signal at the specific level\nwithin Dermanyssus and represents a promising marker for future\nprospects in phylogenetics of Acari. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that\nthe generalist condition is apomorphic and D. gallinae represents a\ncomplex of hybridized lineages. The split into hirsutus-group and\ngallinae-group in Dermanyssus does not seem to be appropriate based upon\nthese results and D. longipes appears to be composed of two different\nentities.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TROHap","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parasitic Mesostigmatid Mites, TPM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined Genes","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parasitic Mesostigmatid Mites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7817.phy"},{"tree_label":"COIHap","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parasitic Mesostigmatid Mites, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7812.phy"}]}
