In\nthis regard, we conducted a survey of mushroom flora between 2016 and\n2018, and collected 95 specimens in Tian Shan of Kyrgyzstan. A total of\n55 species, 47 genera, 24 families, 8 orders, and 2 phyla including\nsaprobic and symbiotic fungi were confirmed through this research. To\nassure the identity of mushrooms collected from Tian Shan in Kyrgyzstan,\nmorphological characteristics and molecular data were applied for the\nfirst time. The results revealed 55 species that are previously\nundescribed and unreported from the region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"278","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115471.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"278","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115472.phy"}]}
