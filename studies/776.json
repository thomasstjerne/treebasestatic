This character state may be unreliable for resolving\nevolutionary relationships, however, due to its likely adaptive nature.\nTaxonomic emphasis on unfurling ascospore appendages has led to the\ninclusion of species within Halosarpheia that are morphologically\nsimilar enough to confound identification, as well as those distinct\nenough to question their placement in the genus. Phylogenetic analyses\nof 18S rDNA sequences demonstrate polyphyly of the genus, with H.\nfibrosa, the type of the genus, resolved separately from all other\nspecies of Halosarpheia analyzed. Morphologically similar species H.\nretorquens, H. viscosa, H. heteroguttulata, and H. lotica are distinct\nspecies separable by RFLP analysis of the ITS1 region as well as 18S\nrDNA sequence analyses. Some morphological characters used to delineate\nspecies within Halosarpheia, such as ascospore guttulation pattern and\nnumber of ascospore appendages, may actually reflect generic differences\nthat have been overshadowed by convergent evolution in appendage\ntype.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halosarpheia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5613.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halosarpheia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5614.phy"}]}
