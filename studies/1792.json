Phylogenetic analyses of\nnLSU rDNA sequence data support the recognition of Chaetothiersia as a\ndistinct genus, and suggest a close relationship to the genus\nParatrichophaea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyronemataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2742.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyronemataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2741.phy"}]}
