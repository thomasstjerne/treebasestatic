Pycnidium-like conidiomata are produced on twigs and in\nculture but unlike pycnidia, conidiomata of E. populi have a closed\nperidium and a locule filled with conidiogenous cells that form conidia\nendogenously. These endoconidia are hyaline, unicellular, and released\nby the dissolution of the peridial cell wall. In addition to\nendoconidia, mostly two-celled conidia that form blastically from\nundifferentiated hyphae occur often in culture but are observed only\noccasionally on Populus twigs. No coelomycetous taxa have been reported\nto produce endoconidia and both the morphological features and DNA\nsequence data demonstrate that Endoconidioma is distinct from the\npreviously established endoconidial genera. Parsimony analyses of\nportions of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU and ITS) suggest that\nEndoconidioma is phylogenetically closely related to members of the\nDothideales and allied anamorphs in Hormonema and Kabatina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 20A","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1852.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 20B","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideaceae and Dothioraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1853.phy"}]}
