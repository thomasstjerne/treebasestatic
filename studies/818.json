The results from ITS analysis were\nlargely consistent with these earlier studies. The New Zealand species\nare included in at least six clades, most of these corresponding to\nrecognized tribes. Our results have also clarified the tribal affinities\nof a few anomalous genera. Haastia, previously aligned with the\nGnaphalieae or the Astereae, is nested in the Senecioneae. Centipeda,\npreviously included in the Astereae or Anthemideae, emerges near the\nHeliantheae. The relationships of Abrotanella remain unresolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1202.phy"}]}
