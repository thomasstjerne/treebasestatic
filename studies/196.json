Although these species differ in\nmany morphological characters and have different (though overlapping)\ngeographical ranges and ecological tolerances they are interfertile and\noften grow in mixed stands and hybrids are occasionally found in nature.\nAll individuals studied were morphologically typical members of their\nrespective species\u001ai.e.Â showed no evidence of recent hybrid ancestry.\nRestriction site markers in the chloroplast DNA reveal several clear\ncases of localized gene exchange between species showing that there is\nappreciable gene flow between sympatric species in this group. One\nlength variant of the nuclear ribosomal DNA however is species specific.\nThe sharp morphological and ecological differences between the species\ntogether with the one ribosomal DNA variant suggest that nuclear genes\nmay be exchanged less freely between species than are chloroplast\ngenotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Quercus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4278.phy"}]}
