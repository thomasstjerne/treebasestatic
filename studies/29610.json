The dataset that\nincluded concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and nrLSU sequences of 67 taxa of\nIrpicaceae from around the world were subjected to the Maximum\nlikelihood analyses and Bayesian inference. In the phylogenetic tree,\nspecies from 14 genera were distributed in 10 clades, among which five\ngenera  Irpex, Phanerochaetella, Byssomerulius, Cytidiella, Meruliopsis\nreceived high support values. The genus Efibula was shown to be\npolyphyletic and four subclades could be recognized, while Phanerochaete\nallantospora, Leptoporus mollis and several species from Ceriporia and\nCandelabrochaete formed a large clade with relatively strong support.\nBased on the molecular and morphological evidence, nine new corticioid\nspecies  Candelabrochaete guangdongensis, Efibula grandinosa, E.\nhainanensis, E. shenghuai, E. taiwaniana, Irpex alboflavescens, I.\nodontioides, Phanerochaetella acystidiata and P. sinensis were revealed\nfrom the materials mostly from East Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136209","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136209.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136210","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136210.phy"}]}
