Resolution\nof these relationships is necessary for studying the steps that underlie\nlife history, genomic, and morphological evolution of this important\nsystem. Using data from five different nuclear genes from 10\nCaenorhabditis species currently in culture, we find a well-resolved\nphylogeny that reveals three striking patterns in the evolution of this\nanimal group: (1) hermaphroditism has evolved independently in C.\nelegans and its close relative C. briggsae; (2) there is a large degree\nof intron turnover within Caenorhabditis and intron losses are much more\nfrequent than intron gains; and (3) despite the lack of marked\nmorphological diversity, more genetic disparity is present within this\none genus than has occurred within all vertebrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenorhabditis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Alternative Tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenorhabditis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_556.phy"}]}
