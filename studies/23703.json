Among the 36 species of Balansia\ndescribed worldwide, ten are reported in Brazil. While most of species\nof balansoid fungi were described on graminaceous hosts only four were\nreported on cyperaceous host. In the present paper we provide a detailed\naccount of the balansoid fungus found on S. bracteata and describe it as\na new Balansia species based on its morphology and phylogenetic\nstudy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"tree inferred from Bayesian Analysis of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2\nsequences representative of Balansia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115206.phy"}]}
