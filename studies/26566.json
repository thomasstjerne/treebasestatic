The results obtained showed\nstrong evidence for the polyphyly of Flourensia identifying two\nwell-supported groups: Flourensia, a clade from North America including\nthe type F. laurifolia, and other clade, here designed as the new genus\nAustroflourensia, containing the South American species.\nAustroflourensia is related to the other four genera composing the\nsubtribe Enceliinae, whereas Flourensia s.s. is sister to all of them.\nAustroflourensia can be mainly distinguished by having a shrubby or\nsubshrubby habit, capitula always radiate usually arranged in weakly\ncymose-corymbose capitulescences, phyllaries 23-seriate, and disc\ncorollas shortly dentate. This paper proposes twelve new combinations to\naccommodate species previously described in the genus Flourensia and\nemended descriptions of Flourensia and the new genus Austroflourensia.\nThe illustration of the type of the new genus, a distribution map, and a\nkey to the genera of Enceliinae are also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"psbA 5","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flourensia psbA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128340.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 577","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flourensia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128338.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS psbA 833","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flourensia ITS psbA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128339.phy"}]}
