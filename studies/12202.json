Vermisporium is chiefly distinguished from Seimatosporium\n(Amphisphaeriaceae) on the basis of a short exogenous basal appendage,\nand the absence of a recognisable apical appendage. Due to the\nincreasing importance of these species in native forests, and confusion\npertaining to their taxonomy, a revision of the genus was undertaken\nbased on fresh collections and dried herbarium specimens. Results from\nDNA sequence data analyses of the nrDNA-ITS and 28S nrRNA genes for\nspecies of Vermisporium indicated the genus to be a synonym of\nSeimatosporium. New combinations are introduced in Seimatosporium for\nseveral species: S. acutum, S. biseptatum, S. brevicentrum, S. obtusum,\nS. orbiculare, S. verrucisporum and S. walkeri. An updated key to all\nspecies occurring on eucalypts is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium (Amphisphaeriaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50196.phy"}]}
