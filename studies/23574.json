However,\ninterspecific delimitation and relationships remain obscure among the\nfour Chinese species, which may result from limited informative sites of\nseveral chloroplast markers. In this study, we aimed to use the whole\nchloroplast genomes to address these two issues. Results: We assembled\nand annotated 33 complete chloroplast genomes (plastomes) of the four\nChinese species, representing 17 populations across most of their\ngeographical distributions. Each species contained samples of several\nindividuals that cover most of geographic distributions of the species.\nAll plastomes are highly conserved in genome structure and gene order,\nwith a total length of 158-159 kb and 122 genes. Phylogenetic analyses\nof whole plastomes, non-coding regions and the protein-coding genesamino\nacid sequences produced almost the same topological relationships. In\ncontrast to the well-delimitated species boundary inferred from the\nnuclear ITS sequence variations, three of the four species are\nnon-monophyletic in the plastome trees, which is consistent with\nprevious studies based on a few chloroplast markers. Conclusions: The\nhigh incongruence between the ITS and plastome trees may suggest the\nwidespread occurrences of hybrid introgression and incomplete lineage\nsorting during the divergence of these species. In addition, the\nplastomes with more informative sites compared with a few chloroplast\nmarkers still failed to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the\nfour species, and further studies involving population genomic data may\nbe needed to better understand their evolutionary histories.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115224.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115225.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115228.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115230.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115223.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115226.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115227.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115229.phy"}]}
