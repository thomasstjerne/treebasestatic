The\nspecimen consists of a partial skeleton from the Upper Jurassic of\nPortugal, herein considered as Stegosaurus cf. ungulatus. The presence\nof this plated dinosaur in the upper Kimmeridgianlower Tithonian\nPortuguese record and synchronic levels of the Morrison Formation of\nNorth America reinforces previous hypothesis of a close relationship\nbetween these two areas during the Late Jurassic. This relationship is\nalso supported by geotectonic evidences indicating high proba- bility of\nan episodic corridor between the Newfoundland and Iberian landmasses.\nTogether, Portuguese Stegosaurus discovery and geotectonic inferences\ncould provide a scenario with episodical faunal contact among North\nAtlantic land-masses during the uppermost Kimmeridgianlowermost\nTithonian (ca. 148153 Ma ago).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stegosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56322.phy"}]}
