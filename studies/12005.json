The new genus is shown to represent a\nmonophyletic lineage sister to a clade comprising the type and some\nother species of Perenniporia in the core polyporoid clade based on\nsequences of the rDNA ITS and LSU regions. Yuchengia shares some common\ncharacters with Perenniporia, both having thick-walled and cyanophilous\nbasidiospores, but Yuchengia differs from Perenniporia by having amyloid\nand acyanophilous skeletal hyphae and non-dextrinoid basidiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70216","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70216.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70217.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70218","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70218.phy"}]}
