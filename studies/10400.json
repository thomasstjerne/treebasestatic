Plant species were identified by\ntracking roots back to above ground structures while fungal species were\nidentified using molecular methods. The fungi were identified to 34\nmolecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs)/species but species\naccumulation curves indicated that the communities were only partially\nsampled. The estimated total species richness was 49 (±9 SD)\nMOTUs/species. No significant ectomycorrhizal community specificity was\nfound between the two plant species and only weak specificity between\ndifferent plant communities. Furthermore, no difference in proportion of\ncolonized root tips could be demonstrated between plant communities.\nHowever, some fungal taxa showed tendencies to associate with specific\nenvironmental conditions. Sebacinaceae, Inocybe egenula, Russula\ncf. emetica, and a Tomentella sp. were found in meadow communities but\nnot in the heath communities. Sistotrema cf. alboluteum and Tomentella\ncf. terrestris were only found in the dry and mesic heath communities.\nClassifications into exploration types showed that the contact type is\nmore abundant in the dry heath community than the other communities.\nCenococcum geophilum was the most common species but Cortinarius spp.,\nRussula spp., Tomentella spp., and Lactarius spp. were also common. This\nstudy confirms that alpine communities are rich in ectomycorrhizal fungi\nincluding species from a wide variety of fungal lineages and also show\nthat many dominant species have wide ecological amplitude.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25317.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25307.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sebacina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25311.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cenococcum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25310.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25313.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25308.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25309.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25316.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laccaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25312.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25314.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistotrema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25315.phy"}]}
