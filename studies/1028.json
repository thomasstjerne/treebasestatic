Species are usually placed in four sections:\nPseudodendron, Epiphytum, Entemophyllon, and Dahlia, based largely on\nmorphological characters, supplemented with cytological, geographical,\nand biochemical data. Combined molecular sequence data from both the\ninternal and external transcribed spacer regions (ITS and ETS), located\nwithin the nuclear ribosomal gene repeat unit, are used to infer a\nphylogeny of the genus. Section Entemophyllon forms a very well-defined\nclade based on these data. Dahlia merckii and D. tubulata are positioned\nbetween sect. Entemophyllon the remaining taxa. Sections Pseudodendron\nand Epiphytum are closely allied with each other and a few species from\nsect. Dahlia to form the variable root clade (VRC), which incorporates\nall species with unusual underground structures, along with some species\nexhibiting the more typical tuberous type. The remaining species of\nsect. Dahlia form a well-defined clade, the core Dahlia clade\n(CDC).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dahlia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1236.phy"}]}
