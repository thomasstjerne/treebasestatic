It was segregated from Alternaria based\non conidial morphology. Recently an unknown alternaria-like dematiaceous\nfungus was found associated with leaf spots on Bidens sulphurea (yellow\ncosmos) in Brazil. Based on a multi-gene phylogeny of parts of the ITS\nand LSU genes, this fungus was placed within the Leptosphaeriaceae with\nAlternariaster helianthi as its closest neighbour. Additional genes\nsequenced, RPB2 and GAPDH, confirmed this close relationship. The fungus\non B. sulphurea has smaller conidia, 50â“97.5 Ã 12.5â“20 Âµm, compared\nto Al. helianthi, 80â“160 Ã 18â“30 Âµm, and lacks oblique or transverse\nsepta which can be present in Al. helianthi. Pathogenicity studies on 18\nplant species belonging to the Compositae showed that the B. sulphurea\nfungus only infected B. sulphurea, whereas Al. helianthi infected H.\nannuus and Galinsoga quadriradiata, a yet unreported host of Al.\nhelianthi. The fungus causing disease on B. sulphurea is hence closely\nrelated but phylogenetically, morphologically and pathologically\ndistinct from Al. helianthi, and therefore newly described as\nAlternariaster bidentis. The collection of a second species in the genus\nAlternariaster and the multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of these two\nspecies, confirmed Alternariaster to be a well delimited genus in the\nLeptosphaeriaceae rather than the Pleosporaceae, to which Alternaria\nbelongs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternariaster ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63300.phy"}]}
