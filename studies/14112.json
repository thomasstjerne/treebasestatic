Speleobregma lanzeroteum Berthelsen, 1986,\npreviously known only from a single specimen from the water column of an\nanchialine cave in Lanzarote, is redescribed. Emended diagnosis, details\non the ciliary patterns and behavioral observations are provided based\nonf newly collected material and in situ observations. Axiokebuita\ncavernicola sp. n. is described from among Pleistocene gravel deposits\nin a shallow water marine cave in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The new\nspecies is characterized by the presence of dorsal ciliary bands and\nshort knob-like neuropodial cirri from segment two. Calculations on\ngranulometry, porosity and permeability show the interstitial\nenvironment of A. cavernicola sp. n. to be comparable in Reynolds\nnumbers to those of the water column or larger crevices of Speleobregma\nand other Axiokebuita spp. Phylogenetic analyses of five gene fragments\nand 46 terminals using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods support a\nderived position of A. cavernicola sp. n. within Axiokebuita, and\nconfirm a sister-group relationship of Axiokebuita with Speleobregma\nwith high nodal support. The Axiokebuita-Speleobregma clade is\nmorphologically characterized by a globular pygidium with adhesive\nglands and ventral ungrooved ciliated palps. Our results support two\nindependent cave colonization events.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Axiokebuita and Speleobregma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62510.phy"}]}
