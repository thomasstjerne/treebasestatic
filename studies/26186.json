Volvox is an interesting group of green\nalgae; it comprises mostly monoicous species, but evidence suggests an\nevolution towards dioicy. Based on cultured strains originating from\nThailand, we describe Volvox longispiniferus, a novel species in Volvox\nsect. Volvox. This species is distinguished from others in the section\nby the large number of sperm packets in its monoicous sexual spheroids\nand by the long spines on its zygote wall. Phylogenetic analyses\nindicate that V. longispiniferus is distinct from the other species of\ntwo monophyletic groups within Volvox sect. Volvox. In addition, the\nnovel species produces more zygotes when different cultures are combined\ncompared with a single culture, suggesting a preference for\noutcrossing.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox rbcL-psbC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123368.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123367.phy"}]}
