Especially, no tree-parasitic powdery mildew species\nhaving wide host ranges have been known so far. However, previous\nreports revealed that powdery mildews occurring on eight genera of\ntropical fruits trees and other woody plants covering five families\nbelong to a single species, Erysiphe quercicola. The authors found in\nIndonesia three additional tropical trees infected by E. quercicola,\nviz.Â Bauhinia purpurea, Durio zibethinus, and Nephelium lappaceum, which\nare cultivated widely in tropical regions as fruit trees, flower trees,\nor industrial crops. This result suggests that these tree species play\nimportant roles as alternative hosts for powdery mildew epidemics caused\nby E. quercicola in tropical regions. Investigations and surveys of the\nexact host range of E. quercicola are important for the management of\nthis powdery mildew.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe quercicola ITS+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101549.phy"}]}
