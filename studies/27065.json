(Roussoellaceae) was found\non bamboo culms collected in the northeast of Thailand. Roussoella\nguttulata differs from other species in having immersed, gregarious,\nblack pseudoascostromata, single and central ostiole with periphyses,\nthin-walled peridium composed of cells of textura angularis to textura\nprismatica, and yellowish-brown ascospores. The multigene phylogenetic\nanalysis shows that the new species forms a distinct lineage basal to R.\nhysterioides, R. japanensis, R. scabrispora, and R. verrucispora. The\nnew species is compared with closely related Roussoella species. A full\ndescription, color photo plates, and a phylogenetic tree to show the\nplacement of the new species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Roussoella guttulata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129502.phy"}]}
