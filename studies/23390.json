The series provides\nmorphological descriptions, information about the pathology,\ndistribution, hosts and disease symptoms for the treated genera, as well\nas primary and secondary DNA barcodes for the currently accepted species\nincluded in these. This third paper in the GOPHY series treats 21 genera\nof phytopathogenic fungi and their relatives including: Allophoma,\nAlternaria, Brunneosphaerella, Elsinoe, Exserohilum, Neosetophoma,\nNeostagonospora, Nothophoma, Parastagonospora, Phaeosphaeriopsis,\nPleiocarpon, Pyrenophora, Ramichloridium, Seifertia, Seiridium,\nSeptoriella, Setophoma, Stagonosporopsis, Stemphylium, Tubakia and\nZasmidium. This study includes three new genera, 42 new species, 23 new\ncombinations, four new names, and three typifications of older\nnames.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 63","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seiridium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119011.phy"}]}
