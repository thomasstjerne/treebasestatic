The species\nwas collected in Yunnan Province, where it grew on undersides of fallen\nangiosperm branch. I. jinshaensis is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, resupinate basidiocarp with white to cream pores when fresh which\nbecoming salmon to cinnamon upon drying, a monomitic hyphal system,\ngenerative hyphae thick-walled with simple septa, and occasionally\ncovered with small crystal granules, the presence of encrusted cystidia\nand subglobose to globose basidiospores. The phylogenetic analysis based\non ITS + nLSU rDNA sequences shows that the new species belongs to\nIrpex, clustering together with I. hydnoides and I. lacteus with strong\nsupport (94% BS, 95% BP, 1.00 BPP, Fig. 1). In addition, a new\ncombination, I. subulatus, is also proposed based on morphological and\nphylogenetic analyses. Both morphological and molecular characters\nconfirm the placement of the new species and combination in Irpex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133976","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133976.phy"}]}
