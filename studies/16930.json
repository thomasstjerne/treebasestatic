In New Zealand and other countries it has become an\naggressive invader of natural ecosystems, causing serious environmental\ndisturbances and threatening biodiversity. Surveys of pathogen and\ninsect natural enemies of T. fluminensis were conducted over several\nyears in Brazil to identify potential candidates for use as classical\nbiological control agents in New Zealand. The surveys found seven\npathogenic fungi associated with T. fluminensis and related Tradescantia\nspecies: Cercospora apii (leaf spot), Rhizoctonia solani (leaf blight),\nSclerotium rolfsii (crown rot) and Uromyces commelinae (rust), and three\nnovel species described in this paper: Ceratobasidium tradescantiae sp.\nnov. (web blight), Colletotrichum riograndense sp. nov. (anthracnose)\nand Kordyana brasiliensis sp. nov. (white smut-like disease).\nObservations of damage in the field and expected host-range suggest that\nK. brasiliensis and U. commelinae have the highest potential for use as\nclassical biological control agents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobiota of weed Tradescantia fluminensis","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_90995.phy"}]}
