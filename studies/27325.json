Isolates are identified using comparisons of DNA sequences of\nthe internal transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA locus (ITS), partial\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), actin (act), DNA-directed\nRNA polymerase II largest (rpb1) and second largest subunit (rpb2)\ngenes, and the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU), combined with\ntheir morphological characteristics. Oculimacula is restricted to two\nspecies, O. acuformis and O. yallundae, with O. aestiva placed in\nCyphellophora, and O. anguioides accommodated in a new genus,\nHelgardiomyces. Rhynchosporium s. str. is restricted to species with\n1-septate conidia and hooked apical beaks, while Rhynchobrunnera is\nintroduced for species with 1Â–3-septate, straight conidia, lacking any\napical beak. Rhynchosporium graminicola is proposed to replace the name\nR. commune applied to the barley scald pathogen based on nomenclatural\npriority. Spermospora is shown to be paraphyletic, representing\nSpermospora (type: S. subulata), with three new species, S.\narrhenatheri, S. loliiphila and S. zeae, and Neospermospora gen. nov.\n(type: N. avenae). Ypsilina (type: Y. graminea), is shown to be\nmonophyletic, but appears to be of minor importance on cereals. Finally,\nVanderaaea gen. nov. (type: V. ammophilae), is introduced as a new\ncoelomycetous fungus occurring on dead leaves of Ammophila\narenaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oculimacula, Rhynchosporium and Spermospora Fig. 1.\nBayesian LSU overview phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127790.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oculimacula, Rhynchosporium and Spermospora Fig. 2.\nReduced Bayesian combined ITS, LSU, act, tef1, rpb2 and rpb1\nphylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127791.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oculimacula, Rhynchosporium and Spermospora Fig. S1.\nBayesian ITS phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127792.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3.
