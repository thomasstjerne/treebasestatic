By the Carnian the main clades Saurischia\nand Ornithischia were already established, and the presence of the most\nprimitive known sauropodomorph Saturnalia suggests also that Saurischia\nhad already diverged into Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha. Knowledge of\nCarnian sauropodomorphs has been restricted to this single species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 10","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55925.phy"}]}
