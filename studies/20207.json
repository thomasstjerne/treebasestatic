It has become a species of interest in recent\nyears because of its role as a wildlife maintenance host for a variety\nof infectious and zoonotic diseases such as corridor disease,\nfoot-and-mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis. To date, no complete\ngenome sequence for S. caffer had been available for study and the\ngenomes of other species such as the domestic cow (Bos taurus) had been\nused as a proxy for any genetics analysis conducted on this species.\nHere, the high coverage genome sequence of the African buffalo (S.\ncaffer) is presented.\nResults: A total of 19,765 genes were predicted and 19,296 genes could\nbe successfully annotated to S. caffer while 469 genes remained\nunannotated. Moreover, in order to extend a detailed annotation of S.\ncaffer, gene clusters were constructed using twelve additional mammalian\ngenomes. The S. caffer genome contains 10,988 gene clusters, of which 62\nare shared exclusively between B. taurus and S. caffer. Conclusions:\nThis study provides a unique genomic perspective for the S. caffer,\nallowing for the identification of novel variants that may play a role\nin the natural history and physiological adaptations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Phylogenetic_tree","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99859.phy"}]}
