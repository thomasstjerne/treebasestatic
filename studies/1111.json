Geodendron araucarioides is\nstrictly related to Tuber borchii, Geodendron hydrophobum is linked to\nTuber oligospermum. The affinity of the two new Geodendron anamorphs to\nthe genus Tuber is confirmed by the comparative analysis of five\nGeodendron collections from four sampling sites. Ectomycorrhizae with\ncharacteristic features of Tuber borchii ectomycorrhizae were found in\nthe soil volume collected with one sample of Geodendron araucarioides. A\nnrDNA sequence amplified from these ectomycorrhizae is identical with\nthe corresponding anamorph sequence, suggesting an ectomycorrhizal\nstatus of Geodendron araucarioides. The possible role of the newly\ndiscovered anamorphs in the Tuber life cycle and the potential\nsignificance of anamorphs for the propagation of ectomycorrhizal fungi\nare discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geodendron nrITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1709.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geodendron LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1708.phy"}]}
