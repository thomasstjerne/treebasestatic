A smaller data set of the family focusing on\nthe Agaricus clade of nrITS sequences, and a combined data set are used\nto determine the position of several white-spored taxa from northern\nThailand. Two new genera are described from Thailand: Coniolepiota\naccommodates Lepiota spongodes, a gray-lilac-purple floccose\nwhite-spored species with a wide distribution in tropical Asia;\nEriocybe, the second new genus, has a white wooly-felted covering of\npileus and stipe, also has white spores, and is described with one new\nspecies E. chionea, so far only known from northern Thailand. These new\ngenera are closely related to three genera with colored spores,\nviz.Â Agaricus, Heinemannomyces and Clarkeinda, and not to other\nwhite-spored taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rpb2","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricaceae rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25565.phy"},{"tree_label":"tef1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricaceae tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25566.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricaceae LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25567.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25568.phy"}]}
