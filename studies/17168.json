The diatom CDKA2 was originally\nassigned to the classical A-type CDKs, but its cell cycle phase-specific\ntranscription at the G2-to-M phase transition is typical for\nplant-specific B-type CDKs. Here, we report the functional\ncharacterization of CDKA2 from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum.\nThrough a yeast two-hybrid library screen, CDKA2 was found to interact\nwith the G2/M-specific CDK scaffolding factor CKS1. Localization of\nCDKA2 was found to be nuclear in interphase cells, while in cells\nundergoing cytokinesis the signal extended to the cell division plane.\nIn addition, overexpression of CDKA2 induced an overall reduction in the\ncell growth rate. Expression analysis of cell cycle marker genes in the\noverexpression lines indicate that this growth reduction is primarily\ndue to a prolongation of the mitotic phase. Our study indicates a role\nfor CDKA2 during cell division in diatoms. The functional\ncharacterization of a CDK with clear CDKB properties in a non-green\norganism questions whether the current definition of B-type CDKs being\nplant-specific might need revision.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom cyclin-dependent kinase A2 CDK alignment\nMUSCLE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86035.phy"}]}
