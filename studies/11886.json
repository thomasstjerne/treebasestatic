The\nattractiveness of developing this system for future studies on the\ngenetics of sex determination prompted us to investigate historical and\ndevelopmental factors surrounding the evolution of its unisexual\nflowers. Our goal was to determine the evolutionary pattern of\npolyploidization of L. sisymbrioides and the timing and process of\nflower reproductive organ abortion. To that end, we used a combination\nof phylogenetics to place this species within the complex history of\npolyploidization events in Lepidium and histology to compare its floral\nontogeny to that of its closest hermaphroditic relatives and to A.\nthaliana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70759.phy"}]}
