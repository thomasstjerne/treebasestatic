The fruitbodies show white\nto cream ascomata with chambered gleba (solid ptychothecium), ornamented\nascospores and cylindrical paraphyses. Based on these morphological\nfeatures, the fungus seems closely related to Reddellomyces\nparvulosporus, R. westraliensis and R. donkii excepting the dimension of\nits ascospores. Molecular analysis based on the nuclear large ribosomal\nsubunit (28S rDNA) and nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) and\nsequences confirm its affiliation to the genus Reddellomyces.\nCombination of molecular data and morphological characteristics of these\norganisms warrants designation of a novel species within the genus\nReddellomyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reddellomyces ITS sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109783.phy"}]}
