In this study, to rapidly detect the causal fungi of anthracnose\ndiseases from the cultivating period to the market after the harvesting,\nwe designated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP)\nprimer set based on the calmodulin gene coded region sequences from\ntaxonomically authorized isolates of this species complex. Moreover, the\nspecificity and detectable range of the set were examined with isolates\nselected from various species complex of the genus Colletotrichum to\nevaluate its specificity and its detectable range. The LAMP primer set\nspecifically detected the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species\ncomplex, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. aotearoa, C.\nfructicola, C. horii, C. kahawae, C. musae, C. siamense, C.\ntheobromicola, and C. tropicale.","trees":[{"tree_label":"5loci CGSC MLT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum CGSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131059.phy"}]}
