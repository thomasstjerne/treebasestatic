Generic boundaries are discussed in the present work,\nand compared with allied genera of the tribe Paniceae. As a result, two\nnew genera are proposed on the basis of morphological, anatomical and\nmolecular characters: Streptostachys macrantha and S. ramosa are\nsegregated into Oncorachis, while the genus Sclerochlamys is based on\nStreptostachys rigidifolia. The phylogenetic position of the new genera\nand Streptostachys are evaluated within the Paniceae; differences and\nsimilarities with the sister taxa are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae, ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5882.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpoC2","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae, rpoC2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5883.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5884.phy"}]}
