Aanen and coÂ­workers, and using refined\nmorphological and molecular methods we were able to recognize further\nindividual taxa within the section. Fifteen species occurring in Europe\nare assigned to H. subsect. Denudata. Of these, we describe eight\nspecies as new, namely H. aanenii, H. aurantioumbrinum, H. geminatum, H.\nlouiseae, H. luteicystidiatum, H. pallidolabiatum, H. perexiguum and H.\nsalicicola. Naucoria bellotiana, a species very similar to H. alpinum is\nrecombined into Hebeloma. A key to Hebeloma subsect. Denudata is\nprovided. We demonstrate that within this subsection there is good\noverall consistency between morphological, phylogenetic and biological\nspecies concepts. In contrast to current opinion, in this group there is\nlittle species overlap, particularly when also considering species\nfrequencies, between arctic and alpine floras on one hand and temperate\non the other.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1 b","ntax":"190","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML v6","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74673.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 c","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"subsect.
