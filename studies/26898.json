The Oomycetes were isolated by using;\nsurface soil dilution plate, sclerotia bait and precolonised plate\nmethods. Isolates were identified as P. acanthophoron, P. amasculinum,\nP. lycopersicum, P. oligandrum, P. periplocum and P. paroecandrum,\naccording to their morphological and molecular characteristics. The most\ncommonly isolated mycoparasitic species were P. amasculinum and P.\nlycopersicum. The majority of the mycoparasites isolated came from soil\nsamples taken in the sugarbeet growing areas. It was determined that all\nisolates of Pythium species showed high mycoparasitic activity against\nBotrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani, however Sclerotinia rolfsii was\nresistant. In conclusion of this study, we can say that the\nmycoparasites belonging to the genus Pythium specially those included in\nthis work, can be used as biocontrol agents against B. cinerea and R.\nsolani.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125681","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125681.phy"}]}
