The phylogenetic\ntrees show that the genus Pythium is greatly divergent group and divided\ninto five well-supported monophyletic clades. Each clade is supported by\nsporangial morphology such as globose, ovoid, elongated or filamentous\nshapes. Based on the phylogeny and morphology, the genus Pythium (s.\nstr.) is emended, and four new genus, Ovatisporangium, Globisporangium,\nElongisporangium, Pilasporangium, are described segregating from\nPythium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium, D1 D2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6463.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium, COX II","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6483.phy"}]}
