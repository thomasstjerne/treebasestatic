Establishment of a\nstable classification system for the subfamily has been challenging due\nto complex evolutionary patterns in adult morphological structures and\ndifficult species identifications. Currently, Carl Heinrichs dual system\npublished in 1956 serves as the main reference point for tribal\nclassification, but its inherent ambiguity and geographic constraints\nhave meant that no system is widely accepted for the subfamily. Here we\npresent the first molecular phylogeny of the Phycitinae based on two\nindependent gene regions (cytochrome oxidase I and elongation factor 1\nalpha). We use this molecular phylogeny to examine evolutionary trends\nin four key morphological traits (hind wing venation, male antennae,\nmale maxillary palpi and male abdomen 8 modifications for pheromone\ndispersion) and determine the phylogenetic utility of these traits. Our\nresults indicate that two major groups of genera exist in the Phycitinae\nand that morphological structures appear to correspond to these\nrelationships, although some homoplasy exists.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Phycitiane_MLTree","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phycitinae COI+EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_81366.phy"}]}
