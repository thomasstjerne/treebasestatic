The\nmorphological study of the teleomorphs and anamorphs was combined with a\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis based sequences of the ribosomal rDNA\ngene cluster and chemotaxonomic studies based on liquid chromatography\ncoupled to electrospray mass spectrometry. Sixteen natural compounds\nwere identified. On the basis of combined analyses, eleven chemotypes\nare inferred","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sporormiella ITS 28S Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_104933.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sporormiella ITS 28S ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_104934.phy"}]}
