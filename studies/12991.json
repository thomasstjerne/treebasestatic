(Volvocales, Chlorophyceae)\nwas described based on a new culture strain originating from Japan.\nBased on light microscopy, vegetative cells of this new species were\nvery similar to those of C. reticulata and C. serbinowii. However, C.\nkasaiae differed from these two species in the ultrastructure of\neyespots (number of globule layers). Our phylogenetic analyses, based on\na combined data set from nuclear-encoded 18S ribosomal (r) RNA, the ATP\nsynthase beta subunit and P700 chlorophyll a apoprotein A2 genes,\nrobustly resolved that C. kasaiae was separate from C. reticulata.\nAlthough these analyses did not resolve the phylogenetic relationship\nbetween C. kasaiae and C. serbinowii, separation of the two was\nsupported based on a comparison of the secondary structure of nuclear\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer 2.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas kasaiae - Bayesian phylogenetic tree based\non combined 18S rRNA, atpB and psaB gene sequences.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55085.phy"}]}
