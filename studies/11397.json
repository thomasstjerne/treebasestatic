Previous studies indicated that the\niridescence-producing nanostructures varied in form and array throughout\nthe order. Thus, in this study, our aim was to reconstruct the\nevolutionary history of these iridescence-producing nanostructures\nwithin this group in a phylogenetic context. Our results show that there\nare some clear tendencies in the evolution of these nanostructures\nthroughout the order.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43199","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43199.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43200","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43200.phy"}]}
