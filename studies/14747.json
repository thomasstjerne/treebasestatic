We sequenced\nthe chloroplast trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic space and the\ntrnH-psbA spacer from 26 North American populations of S. perennis, two\nAltai populations, and ten outgroup taxa, and analyzed these data with\npreviously published sequences. Combined data from trnL, trnL-trnF, and\ntrnH-psbA yielded 11 distinct haplotypes from North America and two from\nthe Altai. Parsimony analyses resolve rooted phylogenies of chloroplast\nlineages within North American S. perennis. In our sample, some lineages\nhave well-characterized, non-overlapping geographic ranges. Further\nsampling will likely reveal additional haplotypes and polymorphism\nwithin populations or geographic areas, but this study lays a foundation\nfor investigations of phylogenetic biogeography in S. perennis and\nco-distributed species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Swertia trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71698.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Swertia trnLF trnH","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71699.phy"}]}
