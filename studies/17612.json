{"Authors":" NA","Year":" 2015","Title":" Phylogenetic position of Madagascan Acacia s.l. species and\nnew combinations in Senegalia and Vachellia (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae,\nAcacieae)","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" molecular phylogeny  nomenclature  taxonomy","DOI":"","Abstract":" Recently a worldwide effort has taken place to transfer\nall no-Australian taxa of Acacia s.l. mostly to the genera Senegalia and\nVachellia. The Madagascan species have previously not been included in\nphylogenetic studies of Acacia s.l. and thus their position is unclear\nin light of some anomalous morphological characters e.g. red flowers.\nPlastid sequence data was generated for seven Madagascan species,\nincluded in existing matrices for African Senegalia and Vachellia and\nanalysed. The results indicate that the Madagascan species are placed\neither in Senegalia or Vachellia and conform to the morphological\ncharacters of those genera, despite some taxa having unusual red\nflowers. New combinations for all the Madagascan species in Senegalia\nand Vachellia are formalized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
