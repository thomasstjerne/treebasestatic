The phylogeny of the anomurans has been fraught with controversy.\nRecent debate has focused primarily on the phenomenon of carcinization,\nthe evolution of crab-like form from a non-crab-like ancestor, focused\nchiefly on derivation of king crabs from asymmetrical hermit crabs  the\n‘hermit to king’ hypothesis. We show by phylogenetic analysis of five\nnuclear protein-coding gene sequences that hermit crabs have a single\norigin, but surprisingly, that almost all other major clades and body\nforms within the Anomura, are derived from within the hermit crabs. The\ncrab-like form and squat lobster form have each evolved at least twice\nfrom separate symmetrical hermit crab ancestors. In each case, a\ncarcinization trend can be posited via a transition series from the\ninitial symmetrical, long-tailed hermit crab form, through the\nintermediate squat lobster or asymmetrical hermit crab form, to the\nfinal crab-like form. Adaptation to dextral shell habitation evolved at\nleast twice, once in an exclusively deep-water clade and once in the\ncommon ancestor of all other asymmetrical hermit crabs (from which king\ncrabs are derived). These remarkable cases of parallelism suggest\nconsiderable phenotypic flexibility within the hermit crab ground plan,\nwith a general tendency towards carcinization. Rather than having a\nseparate origin from other major clades, hermit crabs have given rise to\nmost other major anomuran body types.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43259.phy"}]}
