However, little is known about the variability of the OR\nrepertoire at a shallower evolutionary timeframe. The vast monophyletic\nbat radiation exhibits an extraordinary variety of trophic and sensory\nspecialisations. Unlike other mammals, bats possess a unique and\ndiversified OR gene repertoire. Focusing on recently diverged lineages,\nwe investigated whether the evolution of the OR gene repertoire has been\ninfluenced by ecological niche specialisations, such as\nsensory-modalities, diet and other life history traits. The OR gene\nrepertoires of 27 bat species spanning the whole chiropteran radiation\nwere amplified and sequenced. For each species, intact and\nnon-functional genes were assessed, and the OR gene abundances in each\ngene family were compared. We identified a unique OR pattern tied to the\nfrugivorous diet of New World fruit-eating bats and a similar convergent\npattern in the Old World fruit-eating bats. Our results show a strong\nassociation between niche specialisation and OR repertoire diversity\neven at a shallow evolutionary timeframe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68679","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68679.phy"}]}
