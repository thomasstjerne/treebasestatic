(the generic type), N. crocitincta and N.\nkanehirae combs. nov. based on the combination of distinct morphological\ncharacters and phylogenetic analyses inferred from nuc rDNA partial 28S\n(28S) and ITS datasets. The new genus is characterized by annual,\npileate, brown to fuscous fruiting body, duplex context, a dimitic\nhyphal structure, ventricose and hooked hymenial setae, golden yellow,\nthick-walled, smooth basidiospores that are negative in both Melzers\nreagent and Cotton Blue, and a growth in tropical forests. Neomensularia\nduplicata mostly resembles Mensularia radiata by hooked hymenial setae,\nbut M. radiata has homogenous context, bigger pores (57 per mm), a\nmonomitic hyphal structure, hyphoid setae and larger cyanophilous\nbasidiospores, and occurs in temperate forests. Central American\nspecimens labeled as Inonotus crocitinctus and Asian specimens\nidentified as Fulvifomes kanehirae were reexamined. Their duplex\ncontext, hooked hymenial setae and colored basidiospores point toward\nNeomensularia. Phylogenetic inferences based on 28S DNA and ITS sequence\ndata confirm their affinities with N. duplicata, and hence the new\ncombinations, Neomensularia crocitincta and N. kanehirae, are\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112361","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112361.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112362","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112362.phy"}]}
