ODAM is primarily expressed in dental tissues including the\nenamel organ and the junctional epithelium, and may also have\npleiotropic functions that are unrelated to teeth. Here, we leverage the\npower of natural selection to test competing hypotheses that ODAM is\ntooth-specific versus pleiotropic. Specifically, we compiled and\nscreened complete protein-coding sequences, plus sequences for flanking\nintronic regions, for ODAM in 165 placental mammals to determine if this\ngene contains inactivating mutations in lineages that either lack teeth\n(baleen whales, pangolins, anteaters) or lack enamel on their teeth\n(aardvarks, sloths, armadillos), as would be expected if the only\nessential functions of ODAM are related to tooth development and the\nadhesion of the gingival junctional epithelium to the enamel tooth\nsurface.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"165","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ODAM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115485.phy"}]}
