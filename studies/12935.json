A number of\nderived characters corroborated the hypothesis that the Cynodontinae and\nits three included genera Cynodon, Rhaphiodon, and Hydrolycus are\nmonophyletic. Hydrolycus armatus is the sister group of H. tatauaia; H.\nscomberoides is the sister group of the clade formed by the latter two\nspecies; and H. wallacei is the sister group of the clade formed by H.\narmatus, H. tatauaia, and H. scomberoides. Rhaphiodon vulpinus is the\nsister group to Cynodon, and together they are the sister group to the\nclade formed by Hydrolycus species. Three Cynodon Agassiz, 1829, species\nare diagnosed. Cynodon gibbus Agassiz, 1829, occurs in the Rio Amazonas\nand Río Orinoco basins, and the Rupununi River, Guyana. Cynodon\nmeionactis Géry et al., 1999 occurs in the upper Maroni River, French\nGuiana, and C. septenarius, new species, occurs in the Rio Amazonas and\nits tributaries between the mouths of the Rios Iça and Tapajós, in the\nEssequibo and Demerara rivers in Guyana, and in the upper portions of\nthe Río Orinoco basin. Thaphiodon Agassiz, 1829, is monotypic with R.\nvulpinus being the most widely distributed cynodontine, its distribution\nextending to the Río Paraná-Paraguay, and Río Uraguay systems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynodontinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53937.phy"}]}
