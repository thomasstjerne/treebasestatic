To\ndate, sections Globulares, Leveilleani, Marasmius, Neosessiles, and\nSicci (traditional view) are confrmed in Marasmius s.s. This study\nfocused on the taxa of Marasmius sect. Marasmius, with 18 species from\nthe Atlantic Rainforest of Southeastern Brazil herein included in\nmorphological and phylogenetic analyses based on nrITS data, along with\nspecies of the section from various tropical and temperate areas of the\nWorld. Seven new species are described: Marasmius alienigenus sp. nov.,\nM. avellaneus sp. nov., M. gracilis sp. nov., M. longibasidiatus sp.\nnov., M. subputtemansii sp. nov., M. subvigintifolius sp. nov., and M.\nypyrangensis sp. nov. Additionally, Marasmius sect. Marasmius subsect.\nHorriduli is herein emended based on evidences from phylogenetic and\nmorphological analyses. Subsection Horriduli circumscribes foliicolous\nspecies producing basidiomata containing Chrysochaetes-type elements in\nthe pileipellis and lamellar edge. This prompts the perspective of a\npluralistic view in how characterizing structures of the pileipellis and\ncheilocystidia to replace the paradigmatic dichotomy Rotalis-Siccus in\nclassifcation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius sect Marasmius ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124324.phy"}]}
