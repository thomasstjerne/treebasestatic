Leavitt\nand O. protocetraricus S. Leavitt & Essl. are described from montane\nregions of Central America, further increasing the diversity of this\ngenus in the New World. O. evernicus is separated from O. americanus by\nthe presence of medullary tissue directly beneath the pseudocyphellae,\nwhile O. protocetraricus is separated from O. caespitosus by the\npresence of protocetraric acid. The segregation of both species is\nconfirmed with molecular sequence data (nuclear ITS, nuLSU, and\nÎ²-tubulin). Both species appear to have split from their most recent\ncommon ancestor during the Miocene, supporting Miocene-dominated\ndiversification of Neotropical Oropogon species found in Central\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oropogon ITS, LSU, and beta-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61144.phy"}]}
