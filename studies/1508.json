Based\non rDNA sequence data, the nLSU region is less variable among Armillaria\nspecies than the ITS+5.8S and IGS-1 regions (nLSU<ITS+5.8S<IGS-1).\nPhylogenetic analyses of the rDNA sequences suggested A. mellea, A.\ntabescens, and A. nabsnona are well-separated from the remaining\nArmillaria species (A. ostoyae, A. gemina, A. calvescens, A. sinapina,\nA. gallica, NABS X, and A. cepestipes). Several Armillaria species (A.\ncalvescens, A. sinapina, A. gallica, NABS X, and A. cepestipes)\nclustered together based on rDNA sequencing data; however, AFLP data\nprovided delineation among these species. AFLP analysis supported\ntaxonomic classification established by conventional methods (morphology\nand interfertility tests). Several AFLP genetic markers offer potential\nfor distinguishing currently available North American Biological Species\nof Armillaria in future biological and taxonomical studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria AFLP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MP","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria LSU Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_656.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MB","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria LSU Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 MB","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria ITS Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2397.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 MP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria ITS Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria IGS Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2399.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MP","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria IGS Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2398.phy"}]}
