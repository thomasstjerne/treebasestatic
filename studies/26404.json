In a recent phylogenetic treatment of\n499 isolates in the CBS culture collection, we evaluated the families\nand genera that occur in the order. This study represents the second\npart of this project, and presents multigene phylogenetic analyses for a\nfurther 895 isolates, using ITS, tef1, tub2, LSU, and rpb2 loci, in\ncombination with morphological data. Based on these data a total of 24\nspecies are newly described, namely Botryosphaeria diospyri (Diospyros,\nSouth Africa), B. grevilleae (Grevillea, Australia), Diplodia afrocarpi\n(Afrocarpus, South Africa), D. hexachlamydis (Hexachlamis, Uruguay), D.\npinicola (Pinus, South Africa), Dothiorella diospyri (Diospyros, South\nAfrica), Do. vitigena (Vitis, USA), Do. vitina (Vitis, Spain), Do.\nvitiphila (Vitis, South Africa), Lasiodiplodia acaciae (Acacia,\nIndonesia), L. terminaliae (Terminalia, Tanzania), L. syzygii (Syzygium,\nSouth Africa), Neofusicoccum aloes (Aloe, South Africa), N.\neucalyptigena (Eucalyptus, Venezuela), N. perseae (Persea, USA), N.\npodocarpi (Podocarpus, South Africa), N. rapaneae (Rapanea, South\nAfrica), N. theobromae (Theobroma, Panama), Neoscytalidium sanguinicola\n(human, Netherlands), Ne. gabonense (human, Gabon), Pseudofusicoccum\nperseae (Persea, USA), Saccharata grevilleae (Grevillea, Australia) and\nS. hakearum (Hakea, Australia) and One new combination is introduced as\nPhaeobotryon hypodermia. This study produced an expanded phylogenetic\nbackbone for Botryosphaeriales, and clarified the identity of numerous\nisolates that lacked Latin binomials, or were deposited under incorrect\nnames in the past, adding valuable information to our knowledge of\nspecies in the order.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123946.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum parvum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123947.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neoscytalidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123948.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123943.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123944.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123945.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeobotryon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123949.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123950.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saccharata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123951.phy"}]}
