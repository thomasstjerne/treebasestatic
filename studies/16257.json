Although V. botryosa has been known to\nbe distributed widely as a litter fungus and also known as a human\npathogen, this is the first report of lethal infection confirmed in\ncold-blooded animals including anurans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77047","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95045.phy"}]}
