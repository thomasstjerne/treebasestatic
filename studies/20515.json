The\nfungus produces white hairy colonies over po¬tato dextrose agar medium\nwith sterile ropy mycelial filaments and hyphal coils. Scanning electron\nmicrographs exhibited that they form dense hyphal web which club to form\nrope like mycelium and coils. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) based\nphylogenetic, genetic distance and haplotype analysis confirms its\nidentity as a new species in the genus Muscodor. The fungus also\nproduces a unique mixture of 18 volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\npredominantly producing tetracontane, 4-octadecylmorpholine,\nN,N-dimethyl-1-pentadecanamine and cis-9-hexadecenal. These volatiles\nexhibited synergistic inhibitory effect over a tested battery of\npathogenic microorgan¬isms. Out of 15 tested pathogenic microorganisms,\nthe VOCs inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens by 1370 %, while\nconsiderable inhibition was observed against Candida, Staphylococcus and\nPseudomonas species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscodor ITS1-5.8S-ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106845.phy"}]}
