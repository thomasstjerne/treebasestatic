Isolates from black rotted storage roots of sweet\npotato in China, Japan, Australasia and the USA had identical ITS rDNA\nsequences and only minor variation in microsatellite alleles. Sequences\nof their mating type genes were most similar to those of isolates from\nvarious hosts in Ecuador, a center of diversity for sweet potato.\nIsolates from Colocasia esculenta (taro) and pomegranate from Yunnan and\nSichuan had only one ITS rDNA sequence (haplotype ITS5). This haplotype,\nsequences of mating type genes, and microsatellite alleles linked these\nisolates to isolates from Eucalyptus stumps in South China and diseased\nEucalyptus trees in Brazil, supporting the hypothesis that the\npomegranate population originated from Brazil via cuttings of\nEucalyptus. Isolates from sweet potato and pomegranate in China were\ninter-fertile with tester strains of C. fimbriata, confirming that the\ncauses of the two epidemics in China belong to a single biological\nspecies. However, other isolates from Eucalyptus stumps were\ninter-sterile with the tester strains and had ITS rDNA sequences typical\nof the Asian species, C. cercfabiensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95892.phy"}]}
