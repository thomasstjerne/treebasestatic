Ginger sticks excised from the\nrhizomes were colonised by Py. ramosum which caused soft rot and\nbrowning lesions. Ginger plants inoculated with Py. ramosum showed\ninitial symptoms of wilting and leave yellowing, which were\nindistinguishable from those of Pythium soft rot of ginger, at 10 DAI.\nIn addition, morphological and phylogenetic studies indicated that\nisolates of Py. ramosum were quite variable and our isolates obtained\nfrom soft rot ginger were divided into two groups based on these\nvariations. This is also for the first time Py. ramosum reported as a\npathogen on ginger at high temperatures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythiogeton ramosum COI result 8-1-15","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80856.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythiogeton ramosum ML ITS result 8-1-15","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80857.phy"}]}
