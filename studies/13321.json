Deng, D. G. Zhang & Z. L. Nie,\nan unusual new species of Oxalidaceae from Hunan and Hubei provinces of\ncentral China, is described and illustrated. Placement of this species\nwithin Oxalis was assessed based on DNA sequence-based analyses of the\nnuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and morphological comparisons\nwith related species. This new species can be easily distinguished from\nall its congeners by having long obtriangular, two lateral leaflets\narranged at a 180Â° angle and densely pubescent with brown villous hairs\non both surfaces, pink flowers with lilac veins, and apex of petals\nobtuse or 3-5 irregularly denticulate. The chromosome number of the\nspecies is 2n = 22. With the addition of O. wulingensis, which is the\nonly species endemic to China, a total of seven native species of Oxalis\noccur in the country. We herein provide a taxonomic key to all Chinese\nspecies of Oxalis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxalidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56366.phy"}]}
