The phylogenetic analyses were carried\nout by the ITS+28S dataset and the ITS+28S+tef1-a+rpb2 dataset, and 20\nITS, 20 28S, 22 tef1-a and 20 rpb2 sequences were newly generated.\nAccording to morphological and molecular anslyses, the so-called E.\nglandulosa are actually three species in China, including the real E.\nglandulosa and two new species, E. effusa and E. subglandulosa. Detailed\ndescriptions with macro- and micromorphological photos are provided for\nthese two new species, and their morphological distinguishes and\nphylogenetic relationships with similar species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121806.phy"}]}
