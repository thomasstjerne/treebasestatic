Sequences of four\nundescribed Paramacrobiotus “richtersi groups” (formely Paramacrobiotus\n“richtersi group” 1, Paramacrobiotus “richtersi group” 2,\nParamacrobiotus “richtersi group” 3, and Paramacrobiotus “richtersi\ngroup” 4) and Paramacrobiotus richtersi from different continents were\ndetermined, annotated and their secondary structures predicted. A tree\nbased on a combined sequence-structure alignment was reconstructed by\nNeighbor-Joining. The topology obtained is consistent with a tree based\non a distance matrix of compensatory base changes (CBCs) between all\nITS2 sequence-structure pairs in the global multiple alignment. The CBC\nanalysis, together with 18S rDNA sequences, physiological, biochemical\nand biophysical data identified three new species, morphologically\nindistinguishable from P. richtersi. The species Paramacrobiotus palaui\nsp. nov., Paramacrobiotus kenianus sp. nov., and Paramacrobiotus\nfairbanki sp. nov. are new to science.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ProfDistS tree","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paramacrobiotus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7890.phy"},{"tree_label":"CBC tree","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paramacrobiotus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7889.phy"}]}
