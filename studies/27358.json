During an investigation of\nxylarialean fungi, we collected Paraeutypella guizhouensis gen. et sp.\nnov. based on morphology and ITS and β-tubulin combined phylogenies.\nParaeutypella is characterized by 425 perithecia arranged in a stroma,\nwith 36 sulcate, long ostiolar necks. Paraeutypella citricola comb. nov.\n(Basionym: Eutypella citricola) is introduced from Acer sp. from China.\nDiatrypella longiasca sp. nov. has long ascospores, 25 ascomata per\nstromata compare to other Diatrypella species and distinct\nphylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127756","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127756.phy"}]}
