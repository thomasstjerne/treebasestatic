The internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region from rRNA gene was recently designated\nas the most suitable barcode for fungal identification. In the current\nstudy, we accessed all ITS sequences belonging to aquatic hyphomycete\nspecies present in GenBank at the NCBI. We also generated new barcodes\nbased on ITS region for an additional 9 species, without published ITS\nsequences. These new barcodes and all published ITS sequences were used\nto construct a neighbor-joining tree to establish genetic relationships.\nResults were congruent with those published in a recent study where\nauthors used a combination of ITS and LSU regions. To date, ca. 26% of\nall described aquatic hyphomycete species have been connected with an\nITS barcode.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Aquatic Hyphomycetes ITS and LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68875.phy"}]}
