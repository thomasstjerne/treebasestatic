It is worth to mention that both of\nthem grow on Dracaena cambodiana which is a kind of angiosperm tree\ndistributed in tropical regions. F. dracaenicola is characterised by\nperennial, pileate, triquetrous basidioma with yellowish brown fresh\npores which becoming honey yellow with silk sheening upon drying, a\ndimitic hyphal system in trama and monomitic in context, and subglobose\nbasidiospores measuring 4.85 × 44.1 μm. H. dracaenicola is characterised\nby annual, resupinate basidioma with a clay buff hymenophore, a dimitic\nhyphal system, absence of tomentum and cortex, presence of subulate\nsetae, absence of cystidia, presence of cystidioles and simple hyphidia,\nand oblong ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 5.25.8 × 2.52.8 µm. The\nphylogenetic analyses based on ITS + nLSU rDNA sequences confirm the\nplacement of two new species respectively in Fulvifomes and\nHymenochaete. Phylogenetically closely related species to the two new\nspecies are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132035.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132034.phy"}]}
