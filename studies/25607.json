In this study, isolates from melanose samples were obtained\nand analyzed. Firstly, the ITS sequences were used to measure\nDiaporthe-like boundary species. Then a subset of thirty-eight\nrepresentatives were selected to perform the phylogenetic analysis with\ncombined sequences of ITS, TUB, TEF, CAL, and HIS. As a result, these\nrepresentative isolates were identified belonging to D. citri, D.\ncitriasiana, D. discoidispora, D. eres, D. sojae, and D. unshiuensis.\nAmong these species, the D. citri was the predominant species that could\nbe isolated at highest rate from different melanose diseased tissues.\nThe morphological characteristics of representative isolates of D. citri\nwere investigated on different media. Finally, a molecular tool based on\nthe novel species-specific primer pair TUBDcitri-F1/TUBD-R1, which was\ndesigned from highly conserved region of TUB gene, was developed to\ndetect D. citri efficiently. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon\nof 217 bp could be specifically amplified with the developed molecular\ntool. The sensitivity of the novel species-specific detection was upon\nto 10 pg of D. citri genomic DNA in a reaction. Therefore, the D. citri\ncould be unequivocally identified from closely related Diaporthe species\nby using this simple PCR approach.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123101.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123099.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123098.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123096.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123097.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123100.phy"}]}
