Morphologically, it is characterized\nby hemispherical ascomata with slit-like ostiole, trabeculate\npseudoparaphyses, obclavate to cylindrical asci, and fusiform, hyaline,\n1-septate ascospores, surrounded by a distinctive thin sheath, which is\nfit well with the family Aigialaceae. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses based on a combined LSU, ITS, SSU, and TEF1-Î± sequence data\nshowed that the new collection is affiliated with the genus Fissuroma\nand can be recognized as a new species Fissuroma bambusicola. The\ncomprehensive descriptions of F. bambusicola and notes on its\nphylogenetic placement are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134300","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134300.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134301.phy"}]}
