By contrast, hetero-trans-beta-glucanase (HTG) is the only\nknown enzyme that is preferentially a hetero-transglucanase. Its two\nmain hetero-transglucanase activities are MLG : xyloglucan\nendotransglucosylase (MXE) and cellulose : xyloglucan\nendotransglucosylase (CXE). HTG is highly acidic and found only in the\nevolutionarily isolated genus of fern-allies, Equisetum. We now report\ngenes for three new highly acidic HTG-related XTHs in E. fluviatile\n(EfXTH-A, EfXTH-H and EfXTH-I). We expressed them heterologously in\nPichia and tested the encoded proteinsÂ’ enzymic activities to determine\nwhether their acidity and/or their Equisetum-specific sequences might\nconfer high hetero-transglucanase activity. Untransformed Pichia was\nfound to secrete MLG-degrading enzyme(s), which had to be removed for\nreliable MXE assays. All three acidic EfXTHs exhibited very\npredominantly XET (homo-transglucanase) activity, although low but\nmeasurable hetero-transglucanase activities (MXE and CXE) were also\ndetected in EfXTH-H and EfXTH-I. We conclude that the extremely high\nhetero-transglucanase activities of Equisetum HTG are not emulated by\nsimilarly acidic Equisetum XTHs that share up to 55.5% sequence identity\nwith HTG","trees":[{"tree_label":"BestML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123161.phy"}]}
