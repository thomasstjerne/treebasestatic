So far, the genus\ncontains a single species E. cinnabarinus from China. Typical characters\nof Erythrophylloporus are reddish orange to yellowish red basidiomata\nand lamellae with bright yellow basal mycelium and broadly ellipsoid,\nellipsoid to nearly ovoid basidiospores with smooth surface. During our\nsurvey on diversity of Boletaceae in Thailand, several yellowish orange\nto reddish to brownish orange lamellate boletes were collected. Based on\nboth morphological evidence and molecular analysis of a four-genes data\nset (atp6, tef1, rpb2 and cox3), they were recognized as belonging in\nErythrophylloporus, and different from the already known species. Two\nnew species, E. paucicarpus and E. suthepensis are therefore introduced\nfrom the North of Thailand with full descriptions and illustrations.\nMoreover, two previously described Phylloporus species P. aurantiacus\nand P. fagicola were also revised and are recombined in\nErythrophylloporus. A key to all known Erythrophylloporus species is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"315","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erythrophylloporus species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116244.phy"}]}
