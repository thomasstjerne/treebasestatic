All four species belong to\nthe L. sambuci complex and grow on dead wood. Basidiomata photographs\nand line drawings of microstructures are provided for each species. The\nspecific status of the new taxa was confirmed by ITS and 28S\nphylogenetical analyses. The concept of L. sambuci s. str. is discussed.\nMolecular data reveal one additional cryptic species from Europe,\nmorphologically identical with L. sambuci s. str.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyomyces sambuci Minimum Evolution Phylogram based on\nrLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103356.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyomyces sambuci Minimum Evolution Phylogram based on\nITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103355.phy"}]}
