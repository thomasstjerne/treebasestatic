Three of these species belong to the genus Hebeloma and\nwith their vinaceous colored lamellae and spore print, when fresh, they\nbelong to H. sect. Porphyrospora. Of these three species, only one, P.\nflavidifolia, was validly published and thus we herewith recombine it as\nH. flavidifolium. The other two species, P. splendens and P.\nverrucispora, are synonyms of H. parvisporum and H. lactariolens,\nrespectively. We also describe a new Malayan species, H. radicans, which\nalso belongs to H. sect. Porphyrospora. These findings confirm the\nwestern Pacific Rim as a diversity hotspot for H. sect. Porphyrospora.\nThe records described within this paper, represent the first recognition\nthat the genus Hebeloma, and indeed that members of the ectomycorrhizal\nHymenogastraceae, are present on the Malay Peninsula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128319.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML IQ","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128320","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128320.phy"},{"tree_label":"Raxmll its","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128321","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128321.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml mcm7","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128322","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128322.phy"}]}
