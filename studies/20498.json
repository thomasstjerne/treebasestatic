Thus, this study aims to isolate endophytic fungi from\nNymphaea lotus and Nymphaea stellata. Fungal endophyte was isolated from\nfour surface sterilized segments, leaves, petals, stalks and stamens.\nThe total of 210 fungal isolates were obtained from 640 segments. The\nhighest colonization rates were found in petals segments (0.44), while\nstamens yielded the lowest colonization rate (0.13). Furthermore,\nseasonal influence affects the fungal colonization in their host plants.\nPercentage of colonization rate in rainy season (100%) were more\nabundance than summer season (38%). Sixty-five isolates were\nrepresentative fungal isolates for investigattion their antimicrobial\nactivity. They were cultured on PDB for 3 weeks. Then, Culture broth and\nmycelia were extracted with ethyl acetate and mycelia were extracted\nwith ethyl acetate and hexane. One hundred and ninety-five fungal\nextracts were evaluated their efficiency against ten pathogenic\nmicroorganisms by colorimetric broth microdilution tests. Almost 50% of\nextracts inhibited wide spectrum of microbial tests, except\ngram-negative bacteria. The most active extracts derived from 8 fungal\nisolates. Eight fungal isolates were further identified based on ITS\nsequences by using molecular techniques. They were identified as\nFusarium spp. (FNS009, FNS020 and FNL030), Colletotrichum sp. (FNL053),\nApodus oryzae (FNL023), Eupenicillium levitum (FNL036), Penicillium\nsimplicissimum (FNS024) and Exerohilum sp. (FNS026). CH extract from\nEupenicillium levitum (FNL036) gave the strongest antifungal activity\nwith C. neoformans and P. maneffei (MIC 0.5 Âµg/ml) and affect cell\nmorphology of test microorganisms. This finding confirmed that Nymphaea\nspp. were novel source of active metabolites.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101765.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101761","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101761.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101760","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101760.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101763","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101763.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101768","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101768.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101767","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101767.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101764.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101766","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101766.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101762","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101762.phy"}]}
