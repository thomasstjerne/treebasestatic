The new species is\nintroduced in this paper, with evidence from morphology and phylogenetic\nanalyses. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses of combined\nLSU and ITS sequence data clarified the phylogenetic affinity in\nNeolinocarpon, with the species well separated from Linocarpon in\nLinocarpaceae. This is the first record of Neolinocarpon on\nEuphorbiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110808.phy"}]}
