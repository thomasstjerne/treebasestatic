Phylogenetic\ninferences using DNA sequence data from partial nuc 28S (region\nincluding the D1/D2/D3 domains) resolved this species as a distinct\nclade within the Phylloporia lineage, affine to Phylloporia flacourtiae,\na taxon known from subtropical, eastern Asia in China. Conclusion 혰\nPhylloporia littoralis is the sixth species of the genus described and\nso far only known from the lower Guinean phytogeographic sub-region in\nGabon since 2015. Previously, none Phylloporia species was reported from\nGabon. An identification key to the species occurring in Gabon and\nreported from the Guineo-Congolian phytochorion is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylloporia littoralis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107329.phy"}]}
