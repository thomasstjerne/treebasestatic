Phylogenetic investigations of 70 taxa (68 spp. + 2 vars.) of\ntropical and temperate North American Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae) using\nsequence data from the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) with\nparsimony and Bayesian analyses reveal multiple origins of autogamy.\nBased on breeding and morphological studies, we estimate that North\nAmerican species with xenogamous breeding systems outnumber species with\ninbreeding systems by a factor of five. Parsimony and likelihood\nreconstructions indicate that Ipomoea was ancestrally xenogamous. We\nestimate 16 independent origins of autogamy and 4 subsequent reversions\nto xenogamy. Comparative analyses indicate that breeding system\ntransitions correlate strongly with changes in floral traits.\nTransitions to autogamy are associated with reduced flower size,\ndecreased anther-stigma distance and reduced pollen-ovule ratios.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ipomoea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6802.phy"}]}
