This lineage of flowering plants\nconstitutes an important component of the flora of the Caribbean islands\nwith many endemics. Furthermore, because it is also diverse in adjacent\nMexico, Mesoamerica, and South America it allows a representative\nanalysis of possible migration routes into the Caribbean.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93771.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93770","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93770.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93769","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93769.phy"}]}
