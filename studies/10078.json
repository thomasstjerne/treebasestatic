A\nphylogenetic test using serpentine flax","Journal":" American Journal of Botany","Volume":" 96","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 2010-2021","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" 10.3732/ajb.0900047","Abstract":" Because abiotically extreme environments are often\nassociated with physiological stressful conditions, small, low-density\npopulations, and depauperate flora and fauna relative to more benign\nsettings, organisms that occupy these stressful habitats may experience\nfitness benefits associated with reductions in the frequency and/or\nintensity of antagonistic species interactions. I investigated a\nparticular form of this effect, the pathogen refuge hypothesis, through\na study of 13 species of wild flax that grow on stressful serpentine\nsoils and are often infected by a pathogenic fungal rust. The host\nspecies vary in the degree of their serpentine association: some\nspecialize on extreme serpentine soils while others are generalists that\noccur on soils with a wide range of serpentine influence.\nPhylogenetically explicit analyses of soil chemistry and field-measured\ninfection rates indicated that rust infection was significantly less\nfrequent and severe in flax populations growing in more stressful, low\ncalcium serpentine soils. These findings may help to explain the\npersistence of extremophile species in habitats where stressful physical\nconditions often impose strong autecological fitness costs on associated\norganisms. Ancestral state reconstruction of serpentine soil tolerance\n(approximated using soil calcium concentrations) suggested that the\nability to tolerate extreme serpentine soils may have evolved multiple\ntimes within the focal genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hesperolinon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6570.phy"}]}
