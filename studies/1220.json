These fungi cause a wide variety of symptoms on trees of all\nages, but are mostly associated with canker and die-back of branches and\nmain stems. As disease agents, Botryosphaeria spp. are often encountered\nin their anamorph state, namely species of Fusicoccum, Diplodia or\nLasiodiplodia. During a recent survey of botryosphaeriaceous fungi from\nnative Syzygium cordatum in South Africa, an unfamiliar Lasiodiplodia\nsp. was isolated. The aim of this study was to compare this apparently\nundescribed species with other species of Botryosphaeria using\nmorphological characteristics and DNA sequence data of the rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2. Based on sequence data, the isolates\nfrom S. cordatum were more closely related to B. rhodina (anamorph\nLasiodiplodia theobromae) than other Botryosphaeria spp., but also\nphylogenetically distinct from this species. Conidia of the species from\nS. cordatum were also different to those of L. theobromae. We conclude\nthat the isolates from S. cordatum represent an undescribed\nLasiodiplodia sp. and provide the name Lasiodiplodia gonubiensis for\nit.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia gonubiensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1873.phy"}]}
