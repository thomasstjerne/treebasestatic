Because some\nplant lineages contain more medicinal plants than expected at random,\nphylogeny is expected to guide the discovery of new medicines. Here we\nreconstructed the phylogeny of 148 commonly used medicinal plant species\nin South Africa using DNA barcode regions. We tested for phylogenetic\nsignal in plant uses and evaluated the extent to which species\nevolutionary differences could predict plant popularity (defined here as\nnumber of uses recorded for each plant). We found evidence for signal in\nonly 9.09% of uses, but failed to detect any signal in number of uses\nper plant (i.e. plant popularity). Further, we also tested for\ncorrelations between species phylogenetic uniqueness and species\npopularity. Again our results indicate that species evolutionary history\ndoes not predispose them to any particular level of popularity in\ntraditional medicine. We suggest that the theory of ‘doctrine of\nsignatures’ is more likely to account for the mixed evidence of\nphylogenetic basis we found here for common plant uses in South African\nethnomedicine.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62330.phy"}]}
