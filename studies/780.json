Higher level studies, using DNA\nsequence data from the chloroplast encoded ndhF and trnL intron,\nsuggested that some species of these genera represent a monophyletic\ngroup: the halimolobine clade. The research presented here focuses on\nthe halimolobine clade with denser intra and inter-specific sampling.\nThe primary aims of the project were: (1) to further test the monophyly\nof the halimolobine clade; (2) to test the monophyly Halimolobos,\nMancoa, Pennellia, and Sphaerocardamum; and (3) to study the evolution\nof morphological characters in the clade. Data were generated from the\nchloroplast trnL region, nrDNA ITS, pistillata intron one, and 17\nnon-molecular characters. The difficulties associated with incorporating\nthese data into simultaneous analyses are discussed and a strategy is\npresented. Separate and simultaneous analysis confirmed a monophyletic\ncore group of halimolobine species. The strict consensus tree contained\nfive well-supported halimolobine subclades: Sphaerocardamum, Pennellia\nplus Arabis tricornuta, Mancoa bracteata plus M. foliosa, a narrowly\ndefined Halimolobos group, and a clade consisting of a subset of both\nHalimolobos and Mancoa species. Individual morphological characters vary\nin their utility for classification of the group. However, the majority\nof the characters provide some grouping information within the\nhalimolobine clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"halimolobine Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5620.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"halimolobine Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5623.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"halimolobine Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5624.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"halimolobine Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5621.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"halimolobine Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5622.phy"}]}
