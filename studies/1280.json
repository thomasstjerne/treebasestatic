Muller) collected in the western\nUnited States. The fungus is characterized by the production of\nsynnemata with white or creamish stipes, biverticillate conidiophores\nwith lanceolate phialides typical of subgenus Biverticillium, and small,\nellipsoidal, slightly roughened dark green conidia. In culture, the\nfungus produces velutinous, dark green colonies, with synnemata produced\nnear the margins of the colonies, particularly in fresh isolates exposed\nto light after 10 days. The fungus produces the extrolite apiculide A\nand a series of unidentified metabolites also produced by P. panamense.\nThe oak gall species is described here as Penicillium cecidicola and\ncompared with similar described species. An ITS phylogeny suggests that\nP. cecidicola is a sister species to P. dendriticum, an Australian\nspecies with yellow synnemata that also sometimes occurs on insect\ngalls. Notes are included on several other species of Penicillium that\nwe have isolated from insect galls.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium cecidicola ITS phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_476.phy"}]}
