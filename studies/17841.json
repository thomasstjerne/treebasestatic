The aim of this work was to isolate, identify\nand complete the phylogenetic study of L. gongylophorus species of\nAcromyrmex pubescens (Emery) from Misiones, Argentina. Macroscopic and\nmicroscopic characters were used to identify the fungal symbiont of the\nants. The ITS1-5,8S-ITS2 region was used as molecular marker for\nmolecular identification and to evaluate the phylogeny within the\nLeucoagaricus genus. One fungal symbiont associated to Acromyrmex\npubescens (Emery) was identified as Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. The\nphylogeny of Leucoagaricus obtained using the ITS molecular marker\nrevealed three well established monophyletic groups. It was possible to\nrecognize one clade of Leucoagaricus associated to phylogenetically\nderived leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex and Atta). A second clade of free\nliving forms of Leucoagaricus (non-cultivated), and a third clade of\nLeucoagaricus associated to phylogenetically basal genera of ants were\nalso recognized. The clades corresponded to traditional taxonomic\ngroups, and were differentiated by ecological habitats of different\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus phylogeny Figure 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89143.phy"}]}
