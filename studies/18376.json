Phylogenetic analyses of\nmtSSU DNA sequences have shown that its closest relative is M.\nsubviridescens. ITS rDNA sequence, a marker being the universal barcode\nof fungi, from the holotype was generated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91082.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91083","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91083.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91084.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91085.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91086.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91087.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91088.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91089.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91090.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91091.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91092.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91093","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91093.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91094","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91094.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91095.phy"}]}
