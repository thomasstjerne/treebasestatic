Phylogenetic\nanalyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms, genes, and\nmicrosatellites show that C. posadasii represents a divergent,\ngenetically recombining monophyletic clade. Coccidioides posadasii can\nbe distinguished from C. immitis by numerous DNA polymorphisms, and we\nshow how either of two microsatellite loci may be used as diagnostic\nmarkers for this species. Growth experiments show that C. posadasii has\nsignificantly slower growth rates on high-salt media when compared with\nC. immitis, suggesting that other phenotypic characters may exist.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccidioides microsatellites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5643.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccidioides deltamu^2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5644.phy"}]}
