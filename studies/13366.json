Because of the mycological characteristics of the\nfungus, it was identified to Helotiales, rather Rhytismatales. Based on\nthe morphological comparison with the type specimen of Naemacyclus\nculmigenus, currently known from Poaceae (Andropogon and Panicum), the\npresent fungus was identified as N. culmigenus. In the molecular\nphylogenetic analysis with previously obtained data, generic taxonomy\nwas partially supported, but further inquirers of Naemacyclus and its\nallies were suggested to be required.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57197","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60576","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60576.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60577","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60577.phy"}]}
