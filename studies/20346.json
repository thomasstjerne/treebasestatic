In this system, the ants receive\nshelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the\nplant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence\nof two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently\noccupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid\nancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the\ntwo clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern\nMesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of\nCentral America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in\nsouthern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the\npre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia\ninteraction involved a shift in the ants from closed to open habitats,\ninto an environment with more intense plant herbivory. Comparative\nstudies of the two lineages of mutualists should provide insight into\nthe essential features binding this mutualism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"astral best500","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomyrmex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114189.phy"},{"tree_label":"exabayes nopart","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomyrmex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114190.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml hcluster","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomyrmex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114191.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml kmeans","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomyrmex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114192.phy"}]}
