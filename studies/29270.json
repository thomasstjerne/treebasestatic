Trechispora murina is characterized by the\nresupinate basidiomata with grandinioid hymenial surface and ellipsoid,\nornamented basidiospores. Sequences of ITS rRNA marker of the studied\nsamples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference methods.\nBased on the ITS dataset, the result revealed that the new species T.\nmurina clustered into genus Trechispora, in which T. murina was sister\nto T. bambusicola with higher supports.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
