The new species resembles A. flavus,\nbut produces B and G aflatoxins. It is distinguished from A. flavus and\nA. nomius by differences in growth rates at 37 and 42 C, from A. nomius\nby roughness of the stipe, and from both of these species by differences\nin the nucleotide sequences in the beta-tubulin, calmodulin,\nnorsolorinic acid reductase, ITS, and lsu-rDNA genes. Aspergillus\nbombycis is known from nine isolates, eight collected in\nsilkworm-rearing houses in Japan and one collected in a silk-worm\nrearing house in Indonesia. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequences\nshows that A. bombycis is a phylogenetically distinct species which is\nmost closely related to A. nomius and which belongs in Aspergillus\nsection Flavi. Analysis by partition homogeneity did not reveal evidence\nof genetic recombination in A. bombycis, but in A. nomius the patterns\nof polymorphisms in different genes strongly suggest cryptic genetic\nrecombination.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1cal","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus calmodulin tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5551.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2cal","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus calmodulin tree 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5552.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1id","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus ITS-LSU tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5553.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1nar","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus Norsolorinic acid reductase tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5554.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1bt","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus beta tubulin tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5555.phy"}]}
