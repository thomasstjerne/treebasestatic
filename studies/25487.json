Two\nspecimens collected from subalpine conifer forests in Hokkaido in 2004\nand 2011 are the only records of the genus in Japan. Since they were\nidentified as L. carthusianum without detailed examination, in-depth\nmorphological observation and phylogenetic analysis were necessary to\nconfirm their taxonomic placement. In this study, we critically re-\nexamined the Japanese specimens. Morphologically, the length of\nascospores of the Japanese L. carthusianum was found to be much shorter\nthan that indicated by the original descriptions of the type species and\nits variety. Phylogenetic analyses based on two nuclear ribosomal DNA\nregions showed significant genetic divergence between the Japanese\nspecimens and other specimens of L. carthusianum, including the variety\nfrom China. Accordingly, we described the second species of the genus\nLeucangium, L. microspermum, more than a century after the establishment\nof the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucangium LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124896.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucangium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124897.phy"}]}
