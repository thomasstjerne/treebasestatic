These two new species are R.\nheilongjiangensis (from subsect. Maculatinae) and R. khinganensis (from\nsubsect. Puellarinae). The morphological and molecular analyses support\ntheir taxonomic classification. A comparison of these new species and\nother similar species is also addressed in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112486","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112486.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112485","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112485.phy"}]}
