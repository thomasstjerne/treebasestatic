Nevertheless, this is a conjecture since\nits true phylogenetic affinities remain unknown. This fungus is known to\ncause leaf spots on several members of Cyperus spp. It has been\nintensively investigated in the 1990s as a potential candidate for use\nas an inundative biocontrol agent against purple nutsedge  a major\ntropical weed. Its morphology was recognized, by the few authors who\nhave examined it, as somewhat close to those of Curvularia and\nBipolaris. Nevertheless, it was kept in a separate genus based on two\ndistinctive morphological features: producing two kinds of spores (as\nindicated by its generic name) and having straight versicolored\nmacroconidia. No molecular studies have ever been made to elucidate the\nplacement of Duosporium. In a relatively recent publication Curvularia\namericana and C. chlamydospora were found to produce macro and\nmicroconidia, as in Duosporium. Here, a multilocus phylogenetic analysis\nincluding ITS (nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) and EF1\n(translation elongation factor 1-α) gene regions, placed D. yamadanum\nwithin Curvularia, close to Curvularia tuberculata, Curvularia oryzae\nand Curvularia reesi. This led to the proposal of the new combination\nCurvularia yamadana and the synonymization of Duosporium with\nCurvularia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Duosporium Curvularia ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124323.phy"}]}
