Much attention has been given to\nexamples where parasitic individuals exploit the reproductive investment\nof bourgeois individuals, but some ARTs are instead maintained by\nenvironmental heterogeneity, with alternative tactics exhibiting\ndifferential fitness in discontinuous reproductive niches. We use\ngenomic, behavioral, karyological, and field observational data to\ndemonstrate one such example in plethodontid salamanders. These ARTs\n(searching and guarding males) are associated with different\nreproductive niches and, unlike most other examples in amphibians,\ndemonstrate substantial morphological differ- ences and inflexibility\nwithin a reproductive season. Evidence suggests the existence of these\nARTs within three putative species in the two-lined salamander (Eurycea\nbislineata) species complex, with other members of this clade fixed for\none of the two tactics. We highlight directions for future research in\nthis system, including the relationship between these ARTs and parental\ncare.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eurycea wilderae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114738.phy"}]}
