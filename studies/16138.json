Both\nspecies were collected in mountains at the altitudes of 1850â3000 m,\nfrom Yunnan Province (southwestern China). Hyphoderma moniliforme is\nalso a new record for Eurasia, and previously known only from South\nAfrica. The collections of H. nemorale in this study represent the most\neastern and the most southern localities for this species known for\nEurasia. Both species bear moniliform cystidia. Bayesian inference of\nphylogeny based on ITS and partial 28S nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences\nindicated that H. moniliforme is united in one clade with H. litschaueri\nfrom North America. 28S-based phylogram demonstrated that Chinese H.\nnemorale specimens belong to the same clade with the holotype of this\nspecies collected from Europe. Morphology descriptions and illustrations\nfor these two species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS con50majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphoderma ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89259.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S con50majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphoderma 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89260.phy"}]}
