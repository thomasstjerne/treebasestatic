The newly sequenced genomes of Bjerkandera adusta,\nGanoderma sp., and Phlebia brevispora are introduced and an overview of\n10 currently available Polyporales genomes is provided. The new genomes\nare 39 500 000-49 900 00 bp and encode for 12910-16170 genes. We\nsearched available genomes for single-copy genes and performed\nphylogenetic informativeness analyses to evaluate their potential for\nphylogenetic systematics of the Polyporales. Phylogenomic datasets (25,\n71, 356 genes) were assembled for the 10 Polyporales species with genome\ndata and compared with the most comprehensive dataset of Polyporales to\ndate (six-gene dataset for 373 taxa, including taxa with missing data).\nMaximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of genomic\ndatasets yielded identical topologies, and the corresponding clades also\nwere recovered in the 373-taxa dataset although with different support\nvalues in some datasets. Three previously recognized lineages of\nPolyporales, antrodia, core polyporoid and phlebioid clades, are\nsupported in most datasets, while the status of the residual polyporoid\nclade remains uncertain and certain taxa (e.g.Â Gelatoporia, Grifola,\nTyromyces) apparently do not belong to any of the major lineages of\nPolyporales. The most promising candidate single-copy genes are\npresented, and nodes in the Polyporales phylogeny critical for the\nsuprageneric taxonomy of the order are identified and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"extended supermatrix tree","ntax":"375","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67502.phy"},{"tree_label":"356 genes tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67501.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ribosomal only tree","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67499","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67499.phy"},{"tree_label":"71 genes tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67497","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67497.phy"},{"tree_label":"core supermatrix tree","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67498","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67498.phy"},{"tree_label":"tef1 tree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67494.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 tree","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67495.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB1 tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67496.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67500.phy"}]}
