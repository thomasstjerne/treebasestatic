Diagnostic features include brown, non-flattened branches with\nwhite tips, small, white, ellipsoid, coarsely echinate basidiospores,\nnon-inflated hyphae, and brittle basidiomes that dry grayish white.\nPhylogenetic analyses of nLSU sequence data confirm placement of this\nnew taxon within the Trechisporales. A comprehensive description,\nphotograph of basidiome, SEM of basidiospores, DNA sequences, and\ncomparisons with phenetically similar taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89003","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89003.phy"}]}
