Here we employ isotopic and molecular phylogenetic analyses to\ndetermine its nutritional mode and placement on the fungal tree of life.\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that S. pulvinata is closely related to\nthe genus Coniophora (Coniophoraceae, Boletales). Stable isotope\ncomparisons with known ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi together\nwith phylogenetic evidence also suggest that S. pulvinata is\nsaprotrophic. We conclude that Sedecula likely represents a unique\nmorphological transition from a resupinate basidiocarp morphology (in\nConiophora and relatives) to a hypogeous, sequestrate basidiocarp\nmorphology (in Sedecula). Spore dimensions are amended from the original\ndescription.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sedecula ITS FINAL","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedecula ITS FINAL analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80993.phy"},{"tree_label":"best","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedecula mtLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_81026.phy"},{"tree_label":"best","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedecula LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80994.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF ML","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedecula TEF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_81027.phy"}]}
