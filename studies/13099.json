Among extant organisms having\ncharacters intermediate between fungi and hypothetical protistan\nancestors, from which both fungi and metazoans are believed to have\nevolved, aphelids are unfairly neglected. Phylogenetic position of these\nmicroalgal endoparasites remained uncertain, since no nucleotide\nsequence data have been reported to date. Aphelids resemble some\nprimitive zoosporic fungi in life cycle, but, unlike fungi, they live by\nphagotrophy. Here we present a phylogeny, in which a cultured aphelid\nspecies, Amoeboaphelidium protococcarum, forms a monophyletic group with\nRozella and microsporidia as a sister group to Fungi. We also report a\nnon-canonical nuclear genetic code in A. protococcarum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Early Evolution of Fungi and Metazoans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55986.phy"}]}
