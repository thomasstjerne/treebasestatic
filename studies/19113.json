Names used in ingredient lists of food\nproducts are trivial and in their nature rarely precise. The most recent\nscientiﬁc interpretation of the term bamboo (Bambusoideae, Poaceae)\ncomprises over 1600 distinct species. In the European Union only few of\nthese exotic species are well known sources for food ingredients\n(i.e. bamboo sprouts), thus are not considered novel foods, which would\nrequire safety assessments before marketing of corresponding products.\nIn contrast, the use of bamboo leaves and their taxonomic origin is\nmostly unclear. However, products containing bamboo leaves are currently\nmarketed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rbcLa UPGMA","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bamboo Tea rbcLa UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96459.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLa ML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bamboo Tea rbcLa ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96474.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab MP","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96471.phy"},{"tree_label":"matKK UPGMA","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matKK UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96488.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab+matKK ML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab+matKK ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96493.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab+matKK MP","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab+matKK MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96494.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLb ML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLb ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96469.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLb UPGMA","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLb UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96473.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab ML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96466.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLb MP","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLb MP","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96468.phy"},{"tree_label":"matKK ML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matKK ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96462.phy"},{"tree_label":"matKK MP","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matKK MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96489.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab+matKK UPGMA","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab+matKK UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96492.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLab UPGMA","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLab UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96461.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcLa MP","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcLa MP","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96470.phy"}]}
