Alcorn as taxonomically interestingwere\nre-examined. The morphology of conidia and conidiophores, as well as\nphylogenetic inference from the analyses of three loci (ITS, GAPDH and\nTEF1α) supported the classification of eight novel Bipolaris species,\nwhich were originally isolated from leaf spots on grasses\n(Poaceae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bipolaris spnov ITS GAPDH TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96894.phy"}]}
