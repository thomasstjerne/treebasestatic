It is\nphy-logenetically close to B. clematidis but represents a distinct\nlineage. Morphologically, it differs from the latter in having immersed\nascomata with eccentric, periphysate ostiole and smaller ascospores. Two\nisolates of Neooccultibambusa kaiyangensis sp. nov. clustered with the\ngeneric type N. chiangraiensis, but can be distinguished by the\nmorphology (ascospores dimension) and phylogeny evidences. Whereas,\nNeooccultibambusa trachycarpi sp. nov. can be recognized as a\nphylogenetically distinct species. A detailed, illustrated description\nis provided for these three novel species, and the phylogenetic\nrelationship of Neooccultibambusa is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133996","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133996.phy"}]}
