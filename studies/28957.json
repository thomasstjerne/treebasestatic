Four\ncollections associated with Potentilla fruticosa were obtained from\nGansu and Qinghai provinces in China. Morphologically, they line well\nwith Lentitheciaceae in having subglobose to globose ascomata with brown\nsetae on the papilla but can be distin-guished from other genera by its\nsuperficial, globose, black, thick-walled ascomata, and fusiform,\nhyaline (rarely pale brown), 1-septate ascospores, surrounded by an\nentire mucilaginous sheath. The phylogenetic analyses based on a\ncombined SSU, ITS, LSU and TEF1-Î± sequence data showed that four\nisolates formed a monophyletic clade among the genera of\nLentitheciaceae, and present as a distinct lineage (sister to\nDarksidea). Therefore, we introduce a new genus Crassoascoma, with C.\npotentillae as the type to accommodate these taxa. Detailed description\nand illustration are pro-vided, and the establishment of new taxa is\njustified with morphology and phylogenetic evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134345","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134345.phy"}]}
