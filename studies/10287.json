A positive influence on their\ndivergence is ascribed to their unique explosive pollination mechanism\nwhich has been proposed to be a key-innovation. To test this hypothesis\nphylogenies of the two major African clades (Sarcophrynium and\nMarantochloa clade) were established based on data from nuclear (ITS,\n5S) and chloroplast (trnL/trnL-F) DNA for an almost complete taxon\nsample. The phylogeny was used to parsimoniously reconstruct\nmorphological and ecological traits and geographic distribution\npatterns. The resulting molecular relationships of the genera are\ncongruent with the existing family phylogeny. As in previous studies the\nspecies Ataenidia conferta is nested within Marantochloa so that a new\ncircumscription of Marantochloa is proposed leading to the new name\nMarantochloa conferta. Hybridization events, adaptation to different\npollinators and Pleistocene climatic fluctuations are hypothesized\nevolutionary factors leading to the differences within the family. The\nexplosive pollination mechanism might have played an important role in\noptimizing the mating system but did certainly not force speciation\ndirectly through mechanisms of reproductive isolation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 ITS","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marantaceae, ITS Marantochloa Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6702.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marantaceae, 5S DNA Hypselodelphys Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6760.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 trnL trnLF","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marantaceae, trnL trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6888.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS trnLF","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marantaceae, ITS trnLF Maranthochloa Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marantaceae, ITS trnLF DNA Sarcophrynium Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6887.phy"}]}
