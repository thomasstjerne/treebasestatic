The new species can be easily distinguished from A.\nshabuddin by the following features: body with elongate robust setae on\nlow bumps adjacent to prominent pereional mid-dorsal setal rows;\npereionites wider than long in lateral view; maxillipeds with only one\ncoupling hook each; and distal tip of appendix masculina extending\nbeyond midpoint of the exopod. Discovery of this new species adds to the\nknown diversity and distribution of the Indian hypsimetopid fauna. A key\nto the taxa of the Indian Hypsimetopidae is given. A phylogenetic\nanalysis of 68 species of Phreatoicidea and out-groups have yielded\neight trees with strongly supported clades of Hypsimetopidae,\nAndhracoides + Nichollsia and Andhracoides. The trees are consistent\nwith Gondwana tectonic separation of Indian-Australian continents and\nimply that the family as a whole might have an age of origin earlier\nthan the initial separation of India and Australia. Because\nHypsimetopidae do not show the derived features of the remainder of the\nphreatoicideans that appear in the fossil record, their origin could\npredate the oldest known phreatoicidean fossils in the late\nPaleozoic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tnt 1+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80247.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 2+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80248.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 8+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80254.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 3+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80249.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 4+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80250.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 5+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80251.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 6+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80252.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 7+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80253.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 9+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phreatoicidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80255.phy"}]}
