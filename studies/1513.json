Such\ndifferences in fruit morphology have traditionally been emphasized in\nsectional classifications of Begonia and some of the currently\nrecognized sections can only be distinguished using ovary and fruit\ncharacteristics. We evaluated the monophyly and evolution of three Asian\nsections with atypical fruit morphologies: Platycentrum, Sphenanthera,\nand Leprosae, along with members of nine other Asian sections with fruit\nmorphologies typical of wind dispersed Begonia. A parsimony analysis of\nnrDNA ITS/ 5.8S sequence data of 46 Asian Begonia species suggests that\nthe members of section Platycentrum, which have fruit morphologies\nindicative of rain dispersal, evolved from wind dispersed Asian taxa\nfollowing the colonization of wetter habitats. From within this rain\ndispersed group, species of section Sphenanthera with fleshy, animal\ndispersed fruits subsequently evolved on multiple occasions. Member of\nsection Leprosae, which have fleshy fruit, evolved on two separate\noccasions, in one case independently of the members of the sections\nPlatycentrum and Sphenanthera. As currently recognized sections\nPlatycentrum, Sphenanthera and Leprosae are polyphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Begonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2404.phy"}]}
