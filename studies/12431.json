Inferences from three loci demonstrate that the fungus\ninvolved in each morph of either pair belongs to the same species.\nPhylogenetic analyses resolve all genera of the Lobariaceae as\npolyphyletic, and all Dendriscocaulon-like cyanomorphs within Lobaria,\nexcept for D. dendroides, which belongs to Sticta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"one","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lobariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51211.phy"},{"tree_label":"one","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lobariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51212.phy"}]}
