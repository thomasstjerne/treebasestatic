Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA ITS region showed that\nJapanese A. hemibapha specimens formed a single clade with the lectotype\nof A. caesareoides, which positioned adjacently to A. caesarea and A.\njacksonii. A Thai A. hemibapha specimen that was morphologically\ncorresponded to the isotype of A. hemibapha grouped with its Indian\nspecimens and showed a distant clade from A. caesareoides. Therefore, it\nis concluded that Japanese red-cap Caesarâs mushroom is A.\ncaesareoides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88963.phy"}]}
