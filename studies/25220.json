Arachnoideae, a recently recognized taxon, using DNA\nsequence data (ITS, trnL-F, rpl32-trnL). We conclude that the subsection\ncontains 12 species, i.e., S. aphylla, S. arachnoidea, S. berica, S.\nfacchinii, S. hohenwartii, S. muscoides, S. paradoxa, S. petraea, S.\nprenja, S. presolanensis, S. sedoides and S. tenella. Of these, S.\nmuscoides and S. prenja had not been recognized to belong to subsect.\nArachnoideae before. We conclude that it is not possible to characterize\nthe subsection and to distinguish it from subsect. Saxifraga using\nmorphological characters. A key to the species of the S. sedoides-group\n(S. hohenwartii, S. prenja, S. sedoides) is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Saxifraga trnLF MrBayes","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120099","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga trnLF rpl32 trnL MrBayes","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120102","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga trnLF rpl32 trnL RAxML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120101","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120101.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga rpl32 trnL MrBayes","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120098","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120098.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga trnLF RAxML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120100","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga rpl32 trnL RAxML","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120097","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga ITS MrBayes","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120096","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120096.phy"},{"tree_label":"Saxifraga ITS RAxML","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120095","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120095.phy"}]}
