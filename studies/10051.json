The new species has deltoid-ovate pinnae and\nsubulate microscales with dilated base on abaxial lamina surface\n(broad-type microscales), characters unknown for any other members of\nsect. Haplopolystichum. Additionally, the new species has a few other\ndistinctive morphological features. It has oblanceolate lamina and its\npinnae are repand on margin, obtuse at apex, with acroscopic base round\nand basiscopic base attached at 20 60-degree angles to rachis,\nsubcoriaceous, illustrous adaxially, densely arranged, and strongly\nreflexed and contracted towards lamina base. Palynologically, P.\nspeluncicola has cristate sculpture with numerous spinules on its\nperispore. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on the DNA\nsequences of the trnL-F intergenic spacer showed that P. speluncicola,\ntogether with P. subacutidens, P. yuanum , and species of Cyrtomium\nsubser. Balansana, formed an unresolved polytomy. Polystichum\nspeluncicola can easily be distinguished morphologically from these\nthree species by having broad-type microscales, deltoid-ovate pinnae,\nand much fewer pairs of pinnae per lamina. Our phylogenetic analysis\nresolved the genus Cyrtogonellum as paraphyletic in relation to\nPolystichum sect.
