Phylogenetic\nanalyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear\nribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) region, partial β-tubulin, and elongation\nfactor-1α genes revealed that O. sugadairense was clearly separated from\nother species of the O. piceae complex. The sexual morph of O.\nsugadairense morphologically resembled that of O. breviusculum, but the\naexual morph was clearly distinguishable based on morphological\ncharacteristics of the synnemata, such as the color and shape of the\nstipe. Mating compatibility tests indicated that there is some degree of\nreproductive isolation between O. sugadairense and O. piceae, O.\nbreviusculum, and O. subalpinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ConcatenatedITSBTEF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96814.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree based on beta-tubulin sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96812.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96815.phy"}]}
