The discovery of an incomplete specimen of a new basal\nabelisauroid, Berberosaurus liassicus, gen. et sp. nov., is reported\nfrom the late Early Jurassic of Moroccan High Atlas Mountains.\nPhylogenetic analysis recovers Ceratosauroidea and Coelophysoidea as\nsister lineages within Ceratosauria, and Berberosaurus as a basal\nabelisauroid. Berberosaurus is the oldest known abelisauroid and extends\nthe first appearance datum of this lineage by about 50 million years.\nThe taxon bridges temporal, morphological, and phylogenetic gaps that\nhave hitherto separated Triassic to Early Jurassic coelophysoids from\nLate Jurassic through Cretaceous ceratosauroids. The discovery of an\nAfrican abelisauroid in the Early Jurassic confirms at least a Gondwanan\ndistribution of this group long before the Cretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56314.phy"}]}
