Trichosporon spp. normally cause superficial\ninfections. However, in the past decade Trichosporon spp. are emerging\nas opportunistic agents of invasive fungal infections, particularly in\nseverely immunocompromised patients. Clinical isolates are usually\nsensitive to triazoles, but strains resistant to multiple triazoles have\nbeen reported. Case presentation: We report a high-level pan-azole\nresistant Trichosporon dermatis isolate causing an invasive cholangitis\nin a patient after liver re-transplantation. This infection occurred\ndespite of fluconazole and low dose amphotericin B prophylaxis, and\ntreatment with combined liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole\nfailed. Conclusion: This case and recent reports in literature show that\nnot only bacteria are evolving towards pan-resistance, but also\npathogenic yeasts. Prudent use of antifungals is important to withstand\nemerging antifungal resistance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichosporon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94047.phy"}]}
