Here, we apply a multilocus\napproach to assess the phylogenetic relationships of northern hemisphere\nlampreys, with a special emphasis on the 17 European species. The study\ncomprises two mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I gene - DNA barcodes,\nand cytochrome b) and two nuclear (internal transcribed spacers I and\nII) markers to investigate species phylogenetic affinities. The\nphylogeny obtained with mitochondrial markers revealed a clear and\nhighly supported separation of all northern hemisphere lampreys. Among\nthose, our multilocus results show several polyphyletic genera,\nstressing the need for a taxonomic revision in a near future. Lampetra\nmorii from East Asia, often included in Eudontomyzon is placed in the\ngenus Lethenteron. Lampetra richardsoni and Entosphenus hubbsi should be\nplaced in a new genus, as well as the southern populations of\nLethenteron camtchaticum and Lethenteron reissneri. Considering European\nspecies, our results argue for a taxonomic revision of Eudontomyzon,\nwith emphasis on E. vladykovi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129089.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129090.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129092.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129091.phy"}]}
