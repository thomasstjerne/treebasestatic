During almost 80 years Cyathus badius was included in that\nstatistics and no recollection was occurred until a new expedition to\nthese islands in 2015. Comparisons with the holotype showed consistent\nmorphological features with the new specimen, and phylogenetic analysis\nbased on ribosomal ITS, LSU and concatenated dataset of ITS and LSU\nplaced C. badius in a highly supported clade with C. parvocinereus, C.\nmagnomuralis, C. lignilantanae and C. stercoreus. Because no DNA data\nwas obtained from the type species, is proposed here the epitification\nof C. badius to designate this new sample as the DNA source for this\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree ITS","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus badius Phylogenetic tree obtained by Bayesian\nanalysis of ITS dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98752.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU tree","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus badius Phylogenetic tree obtained by Bayesian\nanalysis of LSU dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98753.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-LSU tree","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus badius Bayesian analysis of ITSLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98754.phy"}]}
