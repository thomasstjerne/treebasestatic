This unusual fungus forms white, sterile,\nrhizomorphs bearing abundant club-shaped branches. Its evolutionary\norigins are unknown because sexual structures were never found. Recent\ncollections and observations of R. corynecarpos were made from Belize,\nBrazil, Ecuador, Guyana and Peru. Phylogenetic analyses of three nuclear\nrDNA regions (internal transcribed spacer, large ribosomal subunit and\nsmall ribosomal subunit) were conducted to resolve the phylogenetic\nrelationship of R. corynecarpos. Results show this fungus is sister to\nBrunneocorticium bisporumÂ—a widely distributed, tropical crust fungus.\nThese two taxa along with Neocampanella blastanos, form a clade of crust\nfungi within the primarily mushroom-forming Marasmiaceae. Based on\nphylogenetic evidence and micromorphological similarities, we propose\nthe new combination, Brunneocorticium corynecarpon, to accommodate this\nspecies. Brunneocorticium corynecarpon is a pathogen, infecting the\ncrowns of trees and shrubs in the Neotropics; the long, dangling\nrhizomorphs with lateral prongs probably colonize neighboring trees.\nLonger-distance dispersal can be accomplished by birds as it is used as\nconstruction material in nests of various bird species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brunneocorticium ITS LSU SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112060.phy"}]}
