These four profiles were\nfurther supported by a principal component analysis of morphometric\ncharacters that yielded four taxonomic clusters which matched those\nproduced by the molecular data. Sequence homology was: a) greater\namongst populations that represented the same RFLP profile than between\nprofiles, and b) similar both between representative populations of the\nRFLP profiles and putative closely related Xiphinema species. This study\nsuggests that X. krugi is a potential species complex comprised of at\nleast four distinct genotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xiphinema krugi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4717.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xiphinema krugi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4718.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xiphinema krugi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4719.phy"}]}
