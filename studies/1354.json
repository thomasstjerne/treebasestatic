We tested the climatic-variability hypothesis (CVH) by\nexamining the relationship between thermal tolerance breadth and\ndistribution. Each of these analyses was performed varying the level of\nphylogenetic inclusiveness. Bergmann’s rule and the CVH were supported,\nbut Rapoport’s rule was not. More variance in the data for Bergmann’s\nrule and the CVH was explained using species belonging to the L.\nboulengeri series rather than all species, and inclusion of multiple\noutgroups tended to obscure these macroecological patterns. Evidence for\nBergmannâ\u001a\u001as rule and the predicted patterns from the CVH remained after\napplication of phylogenetic comparative methods, indicating a greater\nrole of ecological processes rather than phylogeny in shaping the\ncurrent species distributions of these lizards.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 6MP","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4484.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 4MP","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4486.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 5MP","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4485.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 3MP","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4487.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 2MP","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4488.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left 1MP shown","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4489.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 right ML 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Liolaemus Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4490.phy"}]}
