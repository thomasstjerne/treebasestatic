Over the last ten years we have seen great\nefforts focused on revising amphibian systematics. These studies have\noffered much insight regarding frog evolution, but have included a low\nsampling of Microhylidae diversity relative to the described levels of\ndiversity. Here, we provide a phylogenetic study focused on expanding\nprevious hypotheses of relationships within the anuran family\nMicrohylidae; specifically we placed an emphasis on assessing\nrelationships among New World microhylid genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microhylid Frogs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57916.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 2-4","ntax":"225","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microhylid Frogs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57874.phy"}]}
