An\ninteresting event in hair evolution has been its secondarily loss in\nsome mammalian groups, such as cetaceans, whose hairless phenotype\nappears to be an adaptive response to better meet the environmental\nconditions. To determine whether different repertoire of keratin genes\namong mammals can potentially explain the phenotypic hair features of\ndifferent lineages, we characterized the type I and II clusters of alpha\nkeratins from seven mammalian species, including the hairless dolphin\nspecies representing the order Cetacea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"221","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacea Type I Keratin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78127.phy"},{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetacea Type II Keratin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78128.phy"}]}
