There were\nsome divergences between 12S and 16S cladograms, but phylogenetic\nanalyses of the combined molecular data corroborated the monophyly of\nTupinambinae, Teiinae, and “cnemidophorines”, with high support values.\nThe total combined analysis (molecules + morphology) produced similar\nresults, with well-supported Teiinae and \u001acnemidophorines\u001a. We present an\nevolutionary scenario for the evolution of Teiidae, based on molecular\ndating of evolutionary events using Bayesian methods, ancestral areas\nanalysis, the fossil record, the geographic distribution of genera, and\nenvironmental and geologic changes during the Tertiary. According to\nthis scenario, (1) all current teiid genera, except Aspidoscelis,\noriginated in isolation in South America; (2) most teiid genera\noriginated during the Eocene, a period characterized by savanna\nexpansion in South America; and (3) Cnemidophorus originated in South\nAmerica, after which some populations dispersed to Central America\nduring the Late Miocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teiidae, Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5044.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teiidae, Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5043.phy"}]}
