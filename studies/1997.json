However, interspecific relationships were not well\nresolved or supported. In this study, we employed sequences of nrDNA ITS\nand chloroplast gene matK and intergenic spacer psbA-trnH to examine\ninterspecific relationships and infer the character evolution and\nbiogeographic history of Wisteria. Our results show that North American\nspecies of Wisteria form a sister relationship with the eastern Asian\nspecies. In the Asian clade, Wisteria brachybotrys of Japan is sister to\nthe clade containing W. floribunda of Japan and Korea, and W. sinensis,\nW. villosa, and W. brevidentata of China. Sequences vary little among\nthe three Chinese species and there is no well-supported phylogenetic\nstructure, recognizing them as a single species. Our Fitch parsimony\nanalysis suggests that Wisteria sinensis of the continental Asia may\nhave derived from ancestral populations from Japan via Korean Peninsula.\nBoth clockwise twining in W. floribunda and erose leaf margin in W.\nsinensis are more derived features within Wisteria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wisteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2981.phy"}]}
