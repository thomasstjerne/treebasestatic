{"Authors":" Tatyana Livshultz","Year":" 2010","Title":" The phylogenetic position of milkweeds (Apocynaceae\nsubfamilies Secamonoideae and Asclepiadoideae): evidence from the\nnucleus and chloroplast.","Journal":" Taxon","Volume":" 59","Issue":" 4","Pages":" 1016-1030","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" The nuclear gene phytochrome A (PHYA) from 71 species of\ncrown clade Apocynaceae (subfamilies Asclepiadoideae, Secamonoideae,\nPeriplocoideae, and four lineages of Apocynoideae) and outgroups is used\nto 1) test the chloroplast phylogeny that places the African tribe\nBaisseeae, with solitary pollen grains, as sister to the\npollinia-bearing milkweeds (Secamonoideae plus Asclepiadoideae), 2)\nresolve the position of tetrad-bearing Periplocoideae, the proposed\nmilkweed sister-group based on morphology, 3) place the enigmatic\nmonotypic Dewevrella, and 4) clarify relationships of the three other\nprimary crown clade lineages: Rhabdadenia, New World clade, and Asian\nclade. Separate analyses of PHYA and chloroplast sequences agree in\nplacing an African monad-bearing clade (Baisseeae plus Dewevrella) as\nthe sister group of the milkweeds. Combined PHYA and chloroplast\ndatasets under parsimony and maximum likelihood reject Periplocoideae as\nthe milkweed sister group with statistical significance. Rhabdadenia is\nplaced as sister to the rest of the crown clade, consistent with aspects\nof its floral morphology and wood anatomy, but without statistical\nsupport. Other relationships among the primary crown clade Apocynaceae\nlineages are also not supported statistically, but power analysis\nindicates that four to eight times as many characters (26,376-52,752\naligned positions) will be sufficient for a robust estimate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6 matrix 8","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clad Apocynaceae PHYA + cp ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6749.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 matrix 1 ML tree","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crown clade Apocynaceae PHYA clones and direct\nsequences ML trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6736.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 matrix 1 strict consensus 8 MPTs","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crown clade Apocynaceae PHYA clones and direct\nsequences strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6927.phy"},{"tree_label":"matrix 6 strict consensus 268 MPTs","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clade Apocynaceae matK and 3â€™ trnK intron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6908.phy"},{"tree_label":"matrix 2 strict consensus 16 MPTs","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clade Apocynaceae PHYA species as terminals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6780.phy"},{"tree_label":"matrix 5 strict consensus 10000 MPTs","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clade Apocynaceae rpL16 intron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6807.phy"},{"tree_label":"matrix 3 strict consensus 10000 MPTs","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clade Apocynaceae trnL intron and trnL-trnF\nspacer","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6737.phy"},{"tree_label":"matrix 4 strict consensus 10000 trees","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crown clade Apocynaceae rps16 intron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6843.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 matrix 7","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crown clade Apocynaceae combined cp ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6946.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 matrix 7","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crown clade Apocynaceae combined cp strict consensus\nparsimony tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6773.phy"}]}
