In this work, this species was subjected to morphological and\nphylogenetic analyses. Its genome was sequenced resulting in 28\nscaffolds and assembled into 27.05 Mb containing 9744 predicted genes,\namong which 396 belong to carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) encoding\ngenes. Here we describe and illustrate this previously unknown species,\nwhich was named Talaromyces borbonicus, by a polyphasic approach\ncombining phenotypic, physiological and sequence data","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109767.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109768.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109769.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces BenA ML phylogram","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109766.phy"}]}
