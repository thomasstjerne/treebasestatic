This conspicuous life-form\nasserts considerable influence on local environmental conditions above\nthe treeline, creating a microhabitat in which individual plants persist\nlonger than do other, herbaceous, plants. Dwarf shrubs are found in most\ntundra ecotones, including on the mountains of tropical Africa where, at\nhigh elevations, alpine-like climatic conditions are found (the\nâAfroalpine sky-islandsâ). One of the most species rich and abundant\ndwarf shrub clades in the Afroalpine is Alchemilla. Through phylogenetic\ninference using chloroplast and nuclear markers we show that African\nAlchemilla species originated following long distance dispersal to\nTropical East Africa, but that the evolution of dwarf shrubs in the\ngroup occurred twice, in Ethiopia and in Tropical East Africa\nindependently. Establishing a temporal timeframe for the evolution of\ndwarf shrubs is challenging given the large differences in ages\nestimated using different Rosaceae, Rosoideae and Fragariinae datasets\nand different dating methods (BEAST and RelTime). However, it seems\nlikely that dwarf shrubs originated in Alchemilla in Tropical Africa as\nrecently as the Pleistocene. The adaptation to alpine-like environments\nin the form of dwarf shrubs has apparently not led to enhanced\ndiversification rates but instead has enabled Alchemilla to become\ndominant in parts of the upper regions in this area. Additionally,\nancestral reconstructions indicate reversals in Alchemilla from plants\nwith a woody base to entirely herbaceous forms, a transition rarely\nreported for angiosperms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
