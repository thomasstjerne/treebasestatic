The atpβ\ndata did not yield any resolution of the investigated group. The other\ndata sets each supported the monophyly of the genus, as did all data\ncombined, and indicate it to be sister to the Lellingeria apiculata\ngroup as proposed in previous studies. While the morphologically\ndistinct M. leptostoma (Fée) R. C. Moran & A. R. Sm. and M. gracilis\n(Hook.) A. R. Sm. are basal lineages with long branch lengths, most of\nthe relationships within the core genus are weakly supported and have\nvery short branch lengths. This indicates a recent radiation of the\ngenus in the northern Andes, its center of diversity, apparently under\nthe influence of the fast uplift of the mountain range and of glacial\nfluctuations of the vegetations zones, with subsequent dispersals to the\nGuyana Highlands, the Brazilian shield, and Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpDNA Strict","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcL, atpB Melpomene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3106.phy"},{"tree_label":"morph tree","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melpomene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3107.phy"}]}
