In this paper,\nphylogenetic relationships within the Leucothoe s.l. were examined using\nDNA sequence from matK, ndhF, nrITS, and morphological characters. The\nresults indicate that Leucothoe s.l. species are distributed between two\nclades. Leucothoe racemosa and L. recurva are stongly supported as being\nsister taxa and are in turn sister to Chamaedaphne calyculata. These two\nLeucothoe species are deciduous and they exhibit “L.racemosa”-type\nautumn inflorescences (as does Chamaedaphne). The other six Leucothoe\ns.l. species (L. axillaris, L. davisiae, L. fontanesiana, L. grayana, L.\ngriffithiana, and L. keiskei) form a strongly supported clade. Leucothoe\ngrayana, a morphologically distinct taxon, is sister to the other five\nspecies in the clade. Based on these data, it is proposed that Leucothoe\ns.l. should be divided into three genera: Eubotryoides (E. grayana),\nEubotrys (E. racemosa and E. recurva) and Leucothoe s.s. (L. axillaris,\nL. davisiae, L. fontanesiana, L. griffithiana and L. keiskei).","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucothoe s.l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6604.phy"}]}
