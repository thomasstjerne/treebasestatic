In this paper, we present Thelephora versatilis and\nThelephora pseudoversatilis, two new species collected in the same\nlocalities of deciduous and sub-perennial tropical forests of Jalisco,\nMexico. Basidiomes of both species are brownish grey to violet brown\nwith clavarioid-mesopodal, sub-resupinate or completely resupinate\ngrowth forms. In turn, phylogenetic analyses using nrDNA ITS sequences\nshowed that these species are not closed related, nevertheless they are\npart of a well-supported clade conformed by several species of\nThelephora, Tomentella and some undescribed Thelephorales. Morphological\nsegregation of these species was attained by analyzing a wide sample of\nspore and hyphae characters. Significant statistical differences between\nthe new species were observed regarding spore size, spine size and\ncontext hyphae width. This work exemplifies the relevance of integrating\nboth morphological and molecular data, as well of the use of an\nappropriate sample size in order to discriminate among morphological\ncryptic species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelephora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75250.phy"}]}
