The phylogeny\nobtained here showed that one of the Mexican species is nested in an\nexclusive clade which in combination with its striking morphological\nfeatures, infers that it represents a new species, while the other\nspecies is placed as a member in the Laccaria trichodermophora clade.\nThis is the first report in Mexico of Laccaria with Fagus grandifolia\nvar. mexicana trees, with which the reported species may form\nectomycorrhizal association. Descriptions are accompanied with\nillustrations of macro- and micromorphological characters and a\ndiscussion of related taxa are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laccaria ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124090.phy"}]}
