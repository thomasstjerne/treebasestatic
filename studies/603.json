We also present 16 morphological characters for phylogenetic\nanalysis. Our analyses yielded poorly-supported nodes deep in the anole\ntree but many well-supported nodes for more recent phylogenetic\ndivergences. We test the hypothesis that the major clades of anoles form\na hard polytomy and present a general statistical framework for testing\nhypothesis of simultaneous branching of lineages by using molecular\nsequence data. Our results suggest that rapid diversification early in\nthe evolutionary history of anoles explains why numberous researchers\nhave had difficulty reconstruction well-supported dichotomous\nphylogenetic trees for anoles.
