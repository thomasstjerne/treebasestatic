The new species is\ndescribed, illustrated and compared morphologically with species\nreported on hosts belonging to the related family Araliaceae.\nAdditionally, two efficient methods for extracting DNA from biotrophic\nfungi are described and the phylogenetic relationship of Meliolales is\ninvestigated here by using nucleotide sequences of the 28S rDNA. Results\nare based on the sequences of 28S rDNA to confirm the relationship of\nMeliolales as a distinct order within Sordariomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule b","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meliola centellae sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53045.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule a","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meliola centellae sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53046.phy"}]}
