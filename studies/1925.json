In this study, we\nexamined their intergeneric relationships based on the ALDH1-1 gene,\nwhich encodes a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family. In the\nclavicipitaceous fungi examined in this study, the nucleotide sequence\nof the third exon of ALDH1-1 (Exon-3) is 889 bp in length and has no\ninsertion/deletion. A phylogenetic tree based on Exon-3 indicated that\nthe clavicipitaceous fungi could be divided into two large groups:\nCordyceps, Nomuraea, and Ustilaginoidea species formed a paraphyletic\ngroup, while the other grass biotrophic species formed a monophyletic\ngroup. This monophyletic group was further divided into three groups\nwith high bootstrap support: i.e., species with Neotyphodium anamorphs\n(e.g. Epichloe\u001aN), species with Ephelis anamorphs (e.g. Heteroepichloe\u001aN),\nand Aciculosporium\u001a|Claviceps species. We discuss the relationships among\nAciculosporium, Heteroepichloe\u001aN, and other clavicipitaceous fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2898.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ALDH","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2897.phy"}]}
