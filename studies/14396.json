This taxon does not\nfit into current classifications. The isopods occurred in abyssal soft\nsediments, near manganese nodules, and in the vicinity of hydrothermal\nvents. Given their wide spatial occurrence across the Atlantic and\nPacific Oceans, a cosmopolitan distribution is assumed. A cladistic\nanalysis revealed a close relationship with the Macrostylidae, a common\nrepresentative of the deep-sea macrofauna. Analyses of character\nevolution across the Janiroidea showed sufficient synapomorphies to\njustify the erection of Urstylis gen. nov. and the new family Urstylidae\nbased on the three new species. All taxa are described in this paper.\nUrstylidae is characterized, amongst other apomorphies, by an elongate\nhabitus with spade-like head; uropods are long, styliform; one pleonite\nis free; antennal merus and carpus are relatively short; the first\npereopod is carpo-propodosubchelate, and more robust and shorter than\npereopod II. Several characters, such as the pereopods posterior\nscale-like claw that basally encloses the distal sensilla may be\ninterpreted as ancestral when compared to the situation in the highly\nderived Macrostylidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66839.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66838.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66840.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66841.phy"}]}
