The type species, described from Europe, is retained\nwithin the Rutstroemiaceae. However, Torrendiella species reported from\nAustralasia, southern South America and China were found to be\nphylogenetically distinct and have been recombined in the newly proposed\ngenus Hymenotorrendiella. The Hymenotorrendiella species are\ndistinguished morphologically from Rutstroemia in having a\nHymenoscyphus-type rather than Sclerotinia-type ascus apex. Zoellneria,\nlinked taxonomically to Torrendiella in the past, is genetically\ndistinct and a synonym of Chaetomella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"fig 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74457","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74457.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74453","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74453.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74455","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74455.phy"}]}
