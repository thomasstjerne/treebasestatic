N. illicii\nmorphologically differs from Neofabraea alba, Neofabraea krawtzewii,\nNeofabraea malicorticis and Neofabraea perennans with its smaller\nascospore size, and from Neofabraea eucalypti by its 1-septate\nascospore. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions using maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian methods indicates that N. illicii is\ndistinct.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS P MPCT Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofabraea illicii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70474.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS P BPtree","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofabraea illicii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70476.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS P MPCT MajRule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofabraea illicii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70475.phy"}]}
