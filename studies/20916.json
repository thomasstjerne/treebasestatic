Currently the genus is composed of 10 species\nassembled in three groups: two groups with four species, and the\nfasciata group with only two species. Here, we analyzed genetic and\nmorphologic data of samples of Homonota fasciata from Paraguay;\naccording to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses, the\nParaguay population represents an undescribed species. Additionally,\nmorphological analysis of the holotype of H. fasciata (MNHN 6756) shows\nthat it is morphologically different from the banded, large-scaled\nHomonota commonly referred to as “H. fasciata”. Given the inconsistency\nbetween morphological characters of the name-bearing type of H. fasciata\nand the species commonly referred to as H. fasciata, we consider them as\ndifferent taxa. Thus, H. fasciata is a species inquirenda which needs\nfurther studies, and we resurrect the name H. horrida for the banded,\nlarge-scaled Homonota. The undescribed species from Paraguay is similar\nto H. horrida, but can be differentiated by the high position of the\nauditory meatus relative to the mouth commissure (vs. low position in H.\nhorrida); and less developed tubercles on the sides of the head,\nincluding a narrow area between the orbit and the auditory meatus\ncovered with small granular scales with or without few tubercles\n(vs. several big tubercles on the sides of the head even in the area\nbetween the orbit and the auditory meatus). The new species is\ndistributed in the Dry Chaco in South America. With the formal\ndescription of this species, the actual diversity of the genus Homonota\nis increased to 12 species. Furthermore, we infer phylogenetic\nrelationships for 11 of the 12 described species of the genus, based on\n11 molecular markers (2 mitochondrial and 9 nuclear genes), with\nconcatenated and species tree approaches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103732","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103732.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103731","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103731.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103750.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103751.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103728","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103728.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103734.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103735.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103736.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103737","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103737.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103743","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103743.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103740","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103740.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103741.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103756","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103756.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103744","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103744.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103746","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103746.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103749.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103748","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103748.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103757","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103757.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103759.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103758.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103755.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103754.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103753.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103747","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103747.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103738","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103738.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103733","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103733.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103752","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103752.phy"}]}
