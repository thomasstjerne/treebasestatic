We develop\nan extension of classical SMC based on partially ordered sets, and show\nhow to apply this framework—which we refer to as —to phylogenetic\nanalysis. We provide a theoretical treatment of PosetSMC and also\npresent experimental evaluation of PosetSMC on both synthetic and real\ndata. The empirical results demonstrate that PosetSMC is a very\npromising alternative to MCMC, providing up to two orders of magnitude\nfaster convergence. We discuss other factors favorable to the adoption\nof PosetSMC in phylogenetics, including its ability to estimate marginal\nlikelihoods, its ready implementability on parallel and distributed\ncomputing platforms, and the possibility of combining with MCMC in\nhybrid MCMC-SMC schemes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"SMC-tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48659.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB-tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48660.phy"}]}
