The analysis of ITS 1 fragment clearly\ndifferentiated between the two polycentric genera Orpinomyces and\nAnaeromyces and these classification is supported by morphological\nobservation. A multi-order phylogram based on ITS2 sequences proved that\nanaerobic rumen fungi are separated from aerobic chytrids, which form a\nwell-supported monophylum with highest possible bootstrap proportion\nvalues of 100 % . Sequence analysis of ITS regions is a powerful tool\nfor the classification of anaerobic fungi, however morphological\ndescription of strains is still necessary because some genera of rumen\nfungi display a high genetic heterogeneity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polycentric rumen anaerobic fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5855.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polycentric rumen anaerobic fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5856.phy"}]}
