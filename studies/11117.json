To determine its phylogenetic position among the\ncurrently recognized Hypnalean mosses, mitochondrial (nad5) and\nchloroplast (rps4) nucleic acid sequences of 237 taxa were investigated.\nMaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of DNA sequence data\nsuggest that Yunnanobryon is a monophyletic sister group to the genus\nRegmatodon (Regmatodontaceae). The findings of this study support the\nestablishment of the new genus Yunnanobryon, the retention of Regmatodon\nat the genus level, and the treatment of these two genera as the family\nRegmatodontaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TS2 rps4 MP","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43888.phy"},{"tree_label":"TS1 nad5 MP","ntax":"237","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43893.phy"},{"tree_label":"TS1 combined MP","ntax":"237","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43892.phy"},{"tree_label":"TS1 rps4 MP","ntax":"237","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43896.phy"},{"tree_label":"TS2 combined MP","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43884.phy"},{"tree_label":"TS2 nad5 MP","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Regmatodontaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43886.phy"}]}
