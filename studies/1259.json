Here we show that\nmodern human head lice, Pediculus humanus, are composed of two ancient\nlineages, whose origin predates modern Homo sapiens by an order of\nmagnitude (ca. 1.18 million years). One of the two louse lineages has a\nworldwide distribution and appears to have undergone a population\nbottleneck ca. 100,000 years ago along with its modern H. sapiens host.\nPhylogenetic and population genetic data suggest that the other lineage,\nfound only in the New World, has remained isolated from the worldwide\nlineage for the last 1.18 million years. The ancient divergence between\nthese two lice is contemporaneous with splits among early species of\nHomo, and cospeciation analyses suggest that the two louse lineages\ncodiverged with a now-extinct species of Homo and the lineage leading to\nmodern H. sapiens. If these lice indeed codiverged with their hosts ca.\n1.18 MYA, then a recent host switch from an archaic species of Homo to\nmodern H. sapiens is required to explain the occurrence of both lineages\non modern H. sapiens. Such a host switch would require direct physical\ncontact between modern and archaic forms of Homo.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1989.phy"}]}
