Phylogenetic relationships in Bombacoideae have been studied, but\nsome genera in Bombax s.l. have not been adequately sampled for\nsufficiently variable molecular markers. The relationships of Eriotheca,\nfor example, have yet to be resolved. Here, nuclear (ITS) and\nchloroplast (trnL-F and matK) sequence data from 50 exemplars of\nBombacoideae and seven additional taxa from other genera of Malvatheca\nwere used to test monophyly of Eriotheca and its relationships with\nrelated genera of Bombax s.l. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of\nindividual and combined sequence data show that Eriotheca is not\nmonophyletic as currently circumscribed but forms a paraphyletic grade\ncontaining Pachira s.l. The newly discovered Eriotheca + Pachira clade\nhas a probable synapomorphy of striate seeds. Additionally, our data\nshow that Rhodognaphalopsis and Bombacopsis are synonymous with Pachira,\nconsistent with their morphological similarities. In addition, two other\nmoderately supported clades emerged within the core Bombacoideae:\nPseudobombax + Ceiba s.l. and Bombax + Spirotheca + Pachira quinata.\nThese three clades and the African Rhodognaphalon together constitute\nthe major clade of core Bombacoideae, whereas Adansonia appears to be\nmore closely related to Catostemma, Scleronema and Cavanillesia. The\nphylogenetic results imply three independent migrations from the New to\nOld World and homoplasy in staminal morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-matk","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of matK data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26227.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-ITS","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of ITS data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26225.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-ITS","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of ITS data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26224.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-matk","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of matK data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26226.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-combined data","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, combined ITS, trnLF and matK data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26220.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-trnlf","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of trnLF data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26230.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-trnlf","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, Bayesian analysis of trnLF data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26231.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule-combined data","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriotheca, combined ITS, trnLF and matK data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26221.phy"}]}
