These two fungi were first reported in 1977 and 1996 as\nPodosphaera spp. from Japan, but have not yet been formally described\nand named. We performed detailed morphological re-examinations and\nphylogenetic analyses based on new specimens. The results clearly show\nthat these fungi are new, hitherto undescribed species. Molecular\nanalyses of E. viburni-plicati indicate that this fungus belongs to the\ngenus Erysiphe, not to Podosphaera, although it has chasmothecia with a\nsingle ascus. This result reveals that monoascus-type chasmothecia are\nnot confined to Podosphaera and Cystotheca as they are also formed by\nsome Erysiphe species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67984.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 181","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67985.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 145","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales Podosphaera 71 taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67986.phy"}]}
