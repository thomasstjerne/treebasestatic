This species is clearly distinct from other\nPestalotiopsis sp. by its long apical appendages, cylindrical and bigger\nconidia and dark brown concolourous median cells. The phylogenetic\nanalysis of DNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer gene\nregion (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) of the rDNA shows this species to form a\ndistinct clade from the Pestalotiopsis sp., and cluster with the genus\nPseudopestalotiopsis, a new genus which was recently carved out from the\ngenus Pestalotiopsis. This species also differs clearly from all\npresently known Pseudopestalotiopsis species such as Ps. theae, Ps.\nindica, and Ps. cocos, by its darker concolourous median cells, conidial\nshape and size. The new microfungal species, Pseudopestalotiopsis\nsepiahiana is hereby described based on morphological and molecular data\nas the fourth species in the genus Pseudopestalotiopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudococos sepiahiana maff GBLOCK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudococos sepiahiana GB strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89103.phy"}]}
