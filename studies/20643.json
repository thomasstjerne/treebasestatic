Phylogenetic analyses showed that\nthe new species is in the Asian-Australian Clade of the C. fimbriata\ncomplex, and it is most closely related to C. polychroma from Indonesia\nand C. cercfabiensis from China. Ceratocystis uchidae differs from these\nspecies in its shorter perithecial necks, longer ostiolar hyphae, and\nreduced growth at 32 °C compared to 30 °C. An unnamed species on\nEucalyptus sp. from Yunnan, China was similar to C. uchidae, but C.\nuchidae forms shorter perithecial necks, and the two species were not\ninterfertile in mating tests. Crossing of mating testers demonstrated\nthat C. uchidae and C. polychroma also are not interfertile. Isolates of\nC. cercfabiensis showed substantial variation in mycelial morphology,\nwith frequent sectoring. Perithecial necks of C. cercfabiensis varied\ngreatly in length, and perithecia with the longest necks failed to exude\nascospores. Also, tester strains of C. cercfabiensis were partially\ninterfertile with tester strains of C. uchidae. Ceratocystis\ncercfabiensis appears to be an aberrant species and may be a hybrid\nbetween two other Ceratocystis spp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102431","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102431.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102432","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102432.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102429.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102430","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102430.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102433","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102433.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102434","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102434.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102435","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102435.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102436","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102436.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102437","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102437.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102438","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102438.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102439.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102440.phy"}]}
