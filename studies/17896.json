The mitogenome of R. intermixta is 16,875 bp long, shows\nthe highest GC content (20.1%) of all studied bee mitogenomes, and\ncontains the typical set of 37 genes. The order of protein-coding and\nrRNA genes is highly conserved across Anthophila, but several tRNA\nrearrangements have occurred. These were mostly observed in the first\nand sixth (nad3-nad5 junction) tRNA clusters, which are considered\nrearrangement hotspots in other taxa. All protein-coding genes contained\nthe common start and stop codons, with cox2 and nad1 having two\nconsecutive stop codons. The mean genetic distance between R. intermixta\nand the other Anthophila ranged from 29% to 33%. Phylogenetic analysis\nof the whole mitogenome supported R. intermixta and Colletidae as sister\ngroup to all other apid species. The discordance among gene sequences in\nphylogenetic signal detected allows selection of mitochondrial genes\nwith greater information content for future phylogenetic analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88920.phy"},{"tree_label":"con
