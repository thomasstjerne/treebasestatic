Given different taxonomic\ninterpretations and proposals of generic and specific relationships, a\nrepresentative phylogenetic analysis is required to clarify the\nsystematics of this group. The present study provides a framework for\nunderstanding phylogenetic relationships and contributing to the\ndevelopment of an appropriate taxonomic treatment of Gilliesieae.\nMolecular analyses, based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid DNA sequences\n(trnL-F spacer and rbcL gene), resolve with high levels of support the\nmonophyly of the tribe and the differentiation of two major clades.\nClade I comprises the genera Gilliesia, Gethyum and Solaria and Clade II\nincludes Miersia and Speea. These well-supported clades are mostly\ncongruent with vegetative and karyotype characters rather than other\nsuch as floral symmetry. At generic level, all molecular analyses show\nparaphyly of the genera Gilliesia and Miersia. Gethyum was found to be\nparaphyletic, from which the validation of the genus Ancrumia is\nconfirmed. Several instances of incongruent phylogenetic signals were\nfound among data sets. The calibrated tree suggests a recent\ndiversification of the tribe (PlioceneÂ–Pleistocene), a contemporary\nprocess of speciation in which instances of hybridization and incomplete\nlineage sorting could explain patterns of paraphyly and incongruence of\nfloral morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1+++","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123521.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1+++","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123523.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123527.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+++","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123522.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123525.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123526.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+++","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123520.phy"}]}
