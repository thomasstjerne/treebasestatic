These black stains were so evident by 2007 that\nthey have become one of the caveâs major problems. In a mycological\nstudy of the black stains, Ochroconis strains were abundant among the\nisolates and constituted the major group of melanised fungi. Two new\nspecies of the genus Ochroconis, O. lascauxensis and O. anomala, were\nisolated and described. The description is based on the morphology of\nthe fungi and the phylogenetic relationships of two of its gene regions\n(ITS and RPB2). In addition, data on their physiology and cellular fatty\nacid profiles are reported. The development of these species was likely\nlinked to the presence of unusual carbon and nitrogen organic sources\nprovided by the intensive biocide treatments.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58476","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58476.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58464","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58464.phy"}]}
