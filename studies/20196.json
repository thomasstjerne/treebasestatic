In the present study, the genome of\nPhialocephala subalpina, the most frequent species of the Phialocephala\nfortinii s.l.  Acephala applanata species complex, was sequenced for\ninsight in the genome structure and gene inventory of these wide-spread\nroot endophytes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99799.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99798","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99798.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala subalpina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99796.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99802.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99815.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99814.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99801.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99803.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99804.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99808.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99805.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99797","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99797.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99806.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99809.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99810.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99811.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"218","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99817","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99817.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99816.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99818","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99818.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99812.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99819.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99800.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99820.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99860","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99860.phy"}]}
