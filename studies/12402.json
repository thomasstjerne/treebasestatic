We introduce a novel\ndistance, the Additive Dollo Distance (ADD), which is consistent for\ndata generated under a Dollo model, and show that it has some useful\ntheoretical properties including an intriguing link to the LogDet\ndistance. Simulations of Dollo data are used to compare a number of\nbinary distances including ADD, LogDet, Nei Li and some simple, but to\nour knowledge previously unstudied, variations on common binary\ndistances. The simulations suggest that ADD outperforms other distances\non Dollo data. Interestingly, we found that the LogDet distance performs\npoorly in the context of a Dollo process, this may have implications for\nits use in connection with conditioned genome reconstruction. We apply\nthe ADD to two Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) data sets, one that\nbroadly covers Eucalpytus species and one that focuses on the Eucalyptus\nseries Adnataria. We also reanalyse gene family presence/absence data on\nbacteria from the COG database and compare the results to previous\nphylogenies estimated using the conditioned genome reconstruction\napproach.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Adnataria PADD","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adnataria PADD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51050.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adnataria ADD","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adnataria ADD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51051.phy"},{"tree_label":"ADD plus 500 ones","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ADD plus 500 ones","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51052.phy"},{"tree_label":"Eucalyptus PADD","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eucalyptus PADD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51049.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bacteria ADD","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacteria ADD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51048.phy"}]}
