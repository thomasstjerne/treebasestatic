Specimens collected from\nHakkâri province of Turkey were studied morphologically and\nphylogenetically using a multi-gene sequence analysis. Pileus, lamellae,\nstipe, spores, basidia and cystidia structures were used as\nmorphological characters and detailed macroscopic and microscopic\ndescriptions of the species were given. To figure out phylogenetic\npositions of the species, DNA sequence data of the Internal Transcribed\nSpacer (ITS), the Large Subunit (LSU) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA\n(rRNA) gene complex and Translation Elongation Factor 1-α (TEF) regions\nwere analysed. At the end of the study, three new records species of\nMelanoleuca (Melanoleuca communis, M.dryophila and M.heterocystidiosa)\nwere reported from Hakkâri province. Melanoleuca communis and\nM.heterocystidiosa species were placed in subgenus Melanoleuca / section\nMelanoleuca. Melanoleuca dryophila was separated from the other two\nspecies and placed in subgenus Urticocytis when ITS and LSU regions were\nanalyzed. Considering the lack of information ofthis genus in Turkey and\nthe fact that no detailed study has been developed before, this work is\nvaluable to the systematics of Melanoleuca and to the taxonomic\nknowledge of agarics in Turkey.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 6","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102915.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 7","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102916.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 8","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102917.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 9","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102918.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 10","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102919.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 11","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102920.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 12","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102921.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 13","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102922.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102910.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102911.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102909.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102908.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 3","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102912","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102912.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 4","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102913.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 5","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102914","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102914.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 14","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102923.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 15","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102924.phy"}]}
