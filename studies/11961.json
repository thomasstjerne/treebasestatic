We\nquantify this phenomenon with a novel scoring method, the outgroup score\npOG. This score expresses if the support for a particular branch of a\ntree decreases with increasingly distant outgroups. Large-scale\nsimulations confirmed that the outgroup support follows this expectation\nand that the pOG score captures this pattern. The score often identifies\nthe correct topology even when the primary reconstruction methods fail,\nparticularly in the presence of model violations. In simulations of\nproblematic phylogenetic scenarios such as rate variation among lineages\n(which can lead to long-branch attraction artifacts) and quartet-based\nreconstruction, the pOG analysis outperformed the primary reconstruction\nmethods. Because the pOG method does not make any assumptions about the\nevolutionary model (besides the decreasing support from increasingly\ndistant outgroups), it can detect cases of violations not treated by a\nspecific model or too strong to be fully corrected. When used as an\noptimization criterion in the construction of a tree of 23 mammals, the\noutgroup signal confirmed many well-accepted mammalian orders and\nsuperorders. It supports Atlantogenata, a clade of Afrotheria and\nXenarthra, and suggests an ArtiodactylaÂ–Chiroptera clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"OG tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48891","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48891.phy"}]}
