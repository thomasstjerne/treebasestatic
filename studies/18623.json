This paper aims\nto investigate how the worlds disjunct temperate zones have been\ncolonised by the pan-temperate plant group Convolvuleae, sampling 148 of\nthe c. 225 known species. We specifically determine the number and\ntiming of amphitropical and transoceanic disjunctions, investigate the\nextent to which disjunctions in Convolvuleae are spatio-temporally\ncongruent with those in other temperate plant groups and determine the\nimpact of Long Distance Dispersal events on diversification rates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Convolvuleae_ITS_matK_rbcL_BEAST_tree","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92304","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92304.phy"}]}
