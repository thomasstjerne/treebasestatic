The placement\nof several species in genera is uncertain, as the phylogeny has yet to\nbe well-resolved with extensive taxon sampling and authentic ex-type\ncultures. In this study, a diatrype-like taxon was found on decaying\nwood in Lijiang, Yunnan Province, China. Morphological characteristics\nand phylogenetic analyses of combined ITS and Î²-tubulin sequences,\nsupported the conclusion that our taxon is a new species, which is named\nDiatrype lijiangensis. The new species differs from other species in\nDiatrype in its stroma morphology, asci and ascospores characteristics.\nThe morphological similarities and dissimilarities of our new species\nwith phylogenetically close alliances are discussed. Micro-morphological\ncharacteristics of the novel taxon are illustrated with\ndescriptions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrype lijiangensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117033.phy"}]}
