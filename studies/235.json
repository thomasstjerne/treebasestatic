{"Authors":" Bruce G. Baldwin","Year":" 1992","Title":" Phylogenetic utility of the internal transcribed spacers of\nnuclear ribosomal DNA in plants: An example from the Compositae.","Journal":" Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","Volume":" 1","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 3-16","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 18-26S\nnuclear ribosomal DNA was sequenced in 12 representatives of the\nCompositae subtribe Madiinae and two outgroup species to assess its\nutility for phylogeny reconstruction. High sequence alignability and\nminimal length variation among ITS 1, 5.8S, and ITS 2 sequences\nfacilitated determination of positional homology of nucleotide sites. In\npairwise comparisons among Madiinae DNAs, sequence divergence at\nunambiguously aligned sites ranged from 0.4 to,19.2% of nucleotides in\nITS 1 and from 0 to 12.9% of nucleotides in ITS 2. Phylogenetic\nrelationships among ITS sequences of Hawaiian silversword alliance\nspecies (Argyroxiphium, Dubautia, and Wilkesia) and California tarweed\ntaxa in Adenothamnus, Madia, Raillardella, and Raillardiopsis are highly\nconcordant with a chloroplast DNA-based phylogeny of this group.\nMaximally parsimonious trees from ITS and chloroplast DNA data all\nsuggest (a) origin of the monophyletic Hawaiian silversword alliance\nfrom a California tarweed ancestor, (b) closer relationship of the\nHawaiian species to Madia and Raillardiopsis than to Adenothamnus or\nRaillardella, (c) paraphyly of Raillardiopsis, a segregate of\nRaillardella, and (d) closer relationship of Raillardiopsis to Madia and\nthe silversword alliance than to Raillardella. These findings indicate\nthat the ITS region in plants should be further explored as a promising\nsource of nuclear phylogenetic markers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4347.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4348.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4349.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2E","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2F","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Compositae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4353.phy"}]}
