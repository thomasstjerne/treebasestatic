The ITS regions including\nthe 5.8S varied in length from 502 to 595 bp. The F63/R635 region varied\nfrom 509-519 bp among isolates sequenced. Reconstructed phylogenies\ninferred from both regions had highly similar topologies for the taxa\nexamined. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences resulted in four\nwell-supported clades corresponding to Cercospora,\nParacercospora/Pseudocercospora, Passalora and Ramulispora, with\nbootstrap values greater than 92% for each clade. Based on the results\nof the analysis, a new combination for Pseudocersporella aestiva is\nproposed in Ramulispora, and Paracercospora is reduced to synonymy with\nPseudocercospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercosporoid Anamorphs of Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1156.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercosporoid Anamorphs of Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercosporoid Anamorphs of Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercosporoid Anamorphs of Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1159.phy"}]}
