They are clearly different from any\nother taxon in the genus Tuber. Tuber shidianense belongs to the\nPuberulum group. It is characterized by whitish ascomata,\npseudoparenchymatous peridium and globose ascospores. Tuber calosporum\nbelongs to the Macrosporum group. It is recognized by yellow and brown\nascomata, prosenchymatous peridium and large elliptic ascospores with\nlow meshes. Phylogenetic relationships and morphological differences of\nthese two new species to the related species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97104.phy"}]}
