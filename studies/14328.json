The specificity of this host relationship is unusual in\nthat Rhizopogon is broadly associated with several tree genera within\nthe Pinaceae and relationships with a host genus are typically\ndistributed across Rhizopogon subgenera. Naturally occurring specimens\nof R. subg. Villosuli have been described only from North American\ncollections, and the unique host relationship with Pseudotsuga is\ndemonstrated only for Rhizopogon associated with P. menziesii\n(Douglas-fir), the dominant species of Pseudotsuga in North America.\nSpecies of Pseudotsuga are naturally distributed around the northern\nPacific Rim, and Rhizopogon associates of other Pseudotsuga spp. are not\nyet described. Here we present the results of field sampling conducted\nin P. japonica forests throughout the Japanese archipelago and describe\nRhizopogon togasawariana sp. nov., which occurs in ectomycorrhizal\nassociation with P. japonica. Placement of this new species within R.\nsubg. Villosuli is supported by morphological and molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis, and its implications to Pseudotsuga-Rhizopogon biogeography\nare discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopogon togasawariana ITS RAXML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64079.phy"}]}
