Chrysocystidiatae, taxonomy,\nStrophariaceae, new species","DOI":"","Abstract":" Two new species of Deconica with chrysocystidia are\ndescribed from Australia and Mexico. Deconica milvispora from Australia\nis characterized by the rhomboid with nodulose angles basidiospores not\nobserved in any member of the genus until now. Deconica esperanzae from\na cloud forest in the south of Mexico is characterized by subrhomboid\nbasidiospores and short cheilocystidia. Full descriptions,\nillustrations, and comparisons with similar species are provided for\nboth species. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses were performed\nemploying sequences of nc ITS rDNA, including seven new sequences from\nhistorical type collections. As expected, the results showed the\nphylogenetic position of the new species described here within sect.\nChrysocystidiatae, this clade is diverse and there are ten new taxa\nunnamed, at this time only two taxa are described. Additionally,\ndiscussion of traits in the four major clades of Deconica is\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rep.10000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124173","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124173.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.11000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124174","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124174.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.12000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124175","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124175.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.13000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124176","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124176.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.14000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124177.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.15000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124178.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.16000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124179","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124179.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.17000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124180.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.18000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124181.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124164.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124165.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124163.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.7000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124170.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.8000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124171.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.9000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124172","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124172.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.3000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124166","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124166.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.4000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124167","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124167.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.5000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124168.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.6000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124169.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.19000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124182.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.20000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124183.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.21000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124184.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.22000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124185.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.23000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124186","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124186.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.24000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124187","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124187.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.25000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124188","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124188.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.26000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124189.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.27000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124190.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.28000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124191.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.5000000","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124192.phy"}]}
