Phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is more derived than\nJianchangornis and Archaeorhynchus, but more basal than all other known\nJehol ornithurines. The new specimen preserves a unique suite of\ncharacters that differentiate it from other known taxa, including\nseveral features previously unreported in Early Cretaceous ornithurines,\nincluding a V-shaped furcula with a short hypocleidium, a rostrocaudally\nelongate unperforated sternum with deep caudal notches absent, and a\ndeltopectoral crest that extends for half to the length of the humerus.\nThe specimen preserves a nearly perfectly articulated skull that\nindicates the species was beaked and preserves details of the skull\nanatomy such as the premaxilla-frontal articulation. The most notable\nfeature of this new specimen is the preservation of a feathered tail\nmorphology previously unknown among Mesozoic birds. It is the second\ntail morphology known among early ornithurines, which have until now\nonly preserved fan-shaped tails. The new specimen preserves a forked\ntail composed of elongate rectrices medially separated by a deep notch.\nThis tail feather morphology in modern birds decreases aerodynamic\nefficiency relative to the fan-shaped tail, but increases chance of\nsexual reproduction. This discovery suggests that this tradeoff\nconvergently evolved in basal members of Ornithurae, and is consisten\nwith the wooded environment inferred for the Jehol.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithurae Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55258.phy"}]}
