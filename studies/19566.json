Here we\nshow that the symbiotic genomic idiosyncrasies of ectomycorrhizal\nbasidiomycetes are also present in C. geophilum with symbiosis-induced,\ntaxon-specific genes of unknown function and reduced numbers of plant\ncell wall-degrading enzymes. C. geophilum still holds a significant set\nof genes in categories known to be involved in pathogenesis and shows an\nincreased genome size due to transposable elements proliferation.\nTranscript profiling indicates that C. geophilum likely plays a role in\nhost tree water relations by increased expression of water channels but\nalso by activating biotic-stress related genes known to prime for an\nenhanced adaptation to drought. The omnipresence of this symbiont on\ntree roots and its impact on host plant water metabolism call for\nfurther studies on mechanisms of host and environmental adaptation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cenococcum geophilum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97660.phy"}]}
