Phylogenetic hypotheses were tested\nfrom analyses of the individual regions and a combined dataset, using\nboth parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Estimates of branch\nsupport were established using bootstrap analyses and Bayesian posterior\nprobabilities. The analyses were used to test the monophyly of the\nspecies and the relationships among taxa in Timmiaceae. Previous\nhypotheses regarding the relationships within the family were based\nsolely on morphology. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses both\ncorroborate and reject elements of the traditional Timmiaceae taxonomy.\nTimmia austriaca, T. megapolitana s.s., T. megapolitana subsp. bavarica\nand section Norvegica represent monophyletic taxa. Timmia norvegica\ns.s., T. norvegica var. excurrens, and T. sibirica were polyphyletic,\nbut together form a single clade. We, therefore, recommend recognizing\nthem as a single taxon, T. norvegica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1. atpB-rbcL spacer","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Timmiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2419.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1. 26S","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Timmiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2420.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1. trnL-trnF region rr","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Timmiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2421.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Timmiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.
