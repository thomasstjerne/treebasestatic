We identified four species from\nvarious insect hosts: 1) Entomophthora planchoniana, six specimens from\naphids; 2) Pandora neoaphidis, three specimens from aphids; 3)\nZoophthora phalloides from an aphid, and 4) Z. radicans, seven specimens\nfrom insects in the orders Diptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. Analysis\nof the ITS1 data for E. planchoniana showed clustering in accordance to\naphid host species. Entomophthora planchoniana from Macrosiphum\neuphorbiae clustered together, separate from the isolate from Myzus\npersicae. The P. neoaphidis specimens clustered with others aphid\npathogenic Pandora sp. sequences available in the Genbank database. In\nthis study, Z. phalloides from Brevicoryne brassicae and Z. radicans\nfrom an unidentified species of Chironomidae (Diptera) in Argentina were\ncharacterized for first time.The present study was initiated to\nelucidate the taxonomy of the entomophthoralean fungi in Argentina using\na combination of morphological characters and gene sequence data. The\ndata presented further emphasize the significance of molecular data in\nentomophthoralean taxonomy and the combination of such data with\ninformation on morphology, ecology and hostrange for accurate\nidentification of entomophthoralean species and allied genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entomophthorales LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130607.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entomophthorales ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130605.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entomophthorales SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130606.phy"}]}
