Symptoms on\nvarious hosts included crown and stem rot, chlorosis, wilting, leaf\nblight, cankers and gumming. This species was isolated from Australia,\nHungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain,\nTaiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States in association\nwith shrubs and herbaceous ornamentals grown mainly in greenhouses. The\nmost prevalent hosts being English Ivy (Hedera helix) and Cistus or\nSageleaf Rockrose (Cistus salvifolius). The association of the species\nwith Acorn Banksia (Banksia prionotes) plants in natural ecosystems in\nAustralia, in affected vineyards (Vitis vinifera) in South Africa, and\nalmond (Prunus dulcis) trees in Spain and Turkey in addition to\ninfection of shrubs and herbaceous ornamentals in a broad range of\nunrelated families are a sign of a wide ecological adaptation of the\nspecies and its potential threat to agricultural and natural ecosystems.\nThe morphology of the persistent non-papillate ellipsoid sporangia,\nunique toruloid lobate hyphal swellings, and amphigynous antheridia does\nnot match with any of the described species. Phylogenetic analysis based\non sequences of the ITS rDNA, EF-1α, and β-tub supported that this\norganism is a hitherto unknown species. Phylogenetically, it is closely\nrelated to species in ITS clade 7b with the most closely related species\nbeing P. sojae. The name Phytophthora niederhauserii has been used in\nprevious publications without the formal description of the holotype.\nThis name is herein validated in this manuscript with the official\ndescription of Phytophthora niederhauserii Abad ZG and Abad JA sp. nov.\nThe name is coined to honor Dr. John S. Niederhauser, a notable Plant\nPathologist and the 1990 World Food Prize laureate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"sample tree
