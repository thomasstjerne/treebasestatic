Taxonomy. Polyphasic approach","DOI":"","Abstract":" Bombacopsis glabra (Malvaceae) occurs naturally in Brazils\nAtlantic Forest and is used to recover degraded areas of permanent\npreservation. Symptoms of leaf spot caused by Diaporthe spp. have been\nobserved in B. glabra saplings in a Brazilian forest nursery. The aim of\nthis study was to identify the fungal species employing morphological\ncharacteristics, pathogenicity tests, and DNA sequence comparisons for\nthe internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), β-tubulin (TUB),\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and calmodulin (CAL) gene\nregions. A novel species was identified and described, named here as\nDiaporthe bombacopsis. Furthermore, this is the first report of a\nspecies belonging to Diaporthe spp. on B. glabra in Brazil. The current\nstudy revealed that documentation of new fungi is a relevant forerunner\nto any research with natural forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118723.phy"}]}
