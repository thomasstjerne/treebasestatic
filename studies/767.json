Species of Massarina used in\nthe study clustered into two distinct clades with high bootstrap support\nin trees generated from maximum parsimony, weighted parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood, and neighbor-joining analyses. The hypothesis that Massarina\nspecies belong to a phylogenetically monophyletic group is rejected.\nSpecies with narrowly fusiform ascospores form a monophyletic clade with\nLophiostoma, a genus highly similar in morphology. The five species\ncurrently accepted in Massarina with such spore morphology are here\ntransferred into the genus Lophiostoma. Massarina species with broadly\nfusiform to ellipsoidal ascospores are retained as Massarina s. str.,\nlectotypified by M. eburnea. Massarina walkeri is presently excluded\nfrom both Massarina and Lophiostoma. The transfer of M. papulosa to a\nnew genus Oletheriostrigula is verified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Massarina (SSU+ITS+5.8S)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3844.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Massarina (ITS+5.8S)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3845.phy"}]}
