In this\nstudy, 63 Zygophiala isolates collected from flyspeck signs on different\nkinds of hosts from different regions of China were used for phylogeny,\nhost range and geography distribution analysis. Multilocus sequence\n(ITS, the partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF),\nÎ²-tubulin (TUB2) and actin (ACT) genes) phylogenetic analyses were\nconducted separately and combined; isolates grouped in 11 different\nclades, of which five new species â Z. emperorae, Z. trispora, Z. musae,\nZ. inaequalis and Z. longispora- were newly recorded. Results indicated\nthat species of Zygophiala differed in observed host range and\ngeographic distribution. Z. wisconsinensis and Z. emperorae were the\nmost prevalent throughout the sampled regions of China, whereas Z.\ntrispora, Z. musae, Z. inaequalis and Z. longispora were collected only\nin southern China. The hosts of Z. wisconsinensis and Z. emperorae were\nmainly Rosaceae plants whereas Z. trispora, Z. musae, Z. inaequalisand\nZ. longispora were found mainly on banana. Host cross inoculation tests\nprovided evidence of host specificity among SBFS species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 52 trees","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala TEF Maj Rule Con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 100 trees","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala ACT Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87123.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 6 trees","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87124.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87122.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 100 trees","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala ITS Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87125.phy"}]}
