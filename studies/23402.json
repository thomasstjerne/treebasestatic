All fungal isolates were extracted with hexane\nand ethyl acetate. Three crude extracts (cell ethyl acetate, cell hexane\nand broth ethyl acetate) were evaluated for their antimicrobial and\nantioxidant activities by using a colorimetric broth microdilution test\nand DPPH free radical scavenging assay, respectively. Eight pathogenic\nbacteria were used in the antimicrobial test including, Staphylococcus\naureus, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli,\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans.\nEthy acetate extract from fungal isolate EF_HA3 and EF_HA9 were the most\nactive against S. Aureus and MRSA with MIC 16, MBC or MFC 32 Âµg/ml.\nFurthermore, these extracts had the strongest antioxidant activity with\nEC50 1.15 mg/ml. These results showed that crude extracts from\nendophytic fungi isolated from Helianthus annuus are interesting because\nthey are a good source of many active metabolites for future\napplications.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114207","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114207.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114206","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114206.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114208","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114208.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114205","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114205.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114204","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114204.phy"}]}
