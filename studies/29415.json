As an exotic species, it was free from pest and disease\nbut gradually the number of insects and pathogens affecting these plants\nhas increased. In recent year, a new disease causing root rot and\ndieback was detected with increasing frequency. On this work, two\nspecies of Phytophthora, P. cinnamomi and P. alticola were identified\nassociated with these symptoms. The Kochs postulates were fulfilled,\nproving that these two species are pathogenic to E. globulus. This is\nthe first report of P. alticola outside South Africa. Although presently\nunknown, the possible factors associated with the increased occurrence\nof this disease are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_3","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135701","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135701.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135697","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135697.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135698","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135698.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135699.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135700","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135700.phy"}]}
