Plastid DNA\ngrouped the hybrid together with Lindsaea ensifolia, suggesting that it\nis the maternal progenitor, while the presence of distinct LEAFY alleles\nconfirmed the presumed hybrid origin. Together with ×Cystocarpium this\nis another confirmed example of deep hybridization event between fern\nlineages that were separated in the early Cenozoic or late\nMesozoic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpDNA","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeaceae cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108271.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeaceae LEAFY","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108272.phy"}]}
