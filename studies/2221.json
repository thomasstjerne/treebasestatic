Macro- and\nmicromorphological characters in combination with ITS sequence data were\nused to circumscribe species. Of the 43 species reported herein, 9\nrepresent new species, viz., M. angustilamellatus, M. diminutivus, M.\ndistantifolius, M. iras, M. kanchingensis, M. kuthubutheenii, M.\nmusicolorus, M. ochropoides, and M. olivascens. An additional 19 species\nare new records for Peninsular Malaysia. Phylogenetic analyses of 36\nMalaysian Marasmius species were conducted based on sequence data from\nnrDNA ITS-1ˆ5.8SˆITS-2 gene regions. The ITS data support the\ncircumscription of species based on morphological characters and are\nuseful in aiding species delimitations. The ITS data do not, however,\nsupport the current sectional delimitation of Marasmius wherein most\nsections are not monophyletic. Comprehensive descriptions, illustrations\nand photographs of each species, a key to aid in diagnosis, comparisons\nwith allied species, and a preliminary phylogenetic construct are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3196.phy"}]}
