The genus consists of two species\nresembling Trichoglossum due to the presence of setae, but differing in\nits ascospores that remain hyaline for long periods, becoming pale brown\nor brown only in maturity. Both Leucoglossum species are known from\nEurasia, although collections are rare over the landmass. L. leucosporum\nis found in Europe,while L. durandii has been reported only from China.\nThis study summarizes all current information on the genus Leucoglossum\nin Russia, combining a critical morphological revision involving type\nmaterial of L. leucosporum with a phylogenetic reconstruction based on a\ncombined data set of the internal transcribed spacer region of the\nnuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS15.8SITS2) and the 28S nuclear ribosomal\nlarge subunit region (nrLSU). The comprehensive morphological study\nresulted in supplemented description of Leucoglossum and L. leucosporum.\nThe results of the molecular study confirmed that Leucoglossum\nrepresents a separate monophyletic group related more to Geoglossum than\nto Trichoglossum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Leucoglossum and related taxa\nusing combined nrITS and nrLSU data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80632.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Leucoglossum and related taxa\nusing nrLSU data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Leucoglossum and related taxa\nusing nrITS data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80631.phy"}]}
