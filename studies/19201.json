Based on a mitochondrial DNA dataset, we analyzed the\nevolutionary history of Turdus assimilis, a species distributed in\nMesoamerica and northwestern South America. Phylogenetic patterns,\ndivergence times, and biogeographic analyses suggest a South American\nancestor for T. assimilis, which split from T. albicollis between 1.4\nand 3.0 Ma ago. The analysis suggests the colonization of Mesoamerica\nand the Chocó region by small numbers of founder individuals.\nFurthermore, genetic divergence, reciprocal monophyly, an ancient\ndisjunction, and clear phenotypic differences suggest that the\npopulation from the Chocó region, T. a. daguae, represents a species\nseparate from T. assimilis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95562","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95562.phy"}]}
