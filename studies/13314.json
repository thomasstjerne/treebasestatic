The analyses of\npartial Î²-tubulin gene (BenA), calmodulin gene (CaM) and rDNA\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence data showed that A. keveioides fell in the clade\nwith A. keveii, A. insuetus, germanicus and A. thesauricus, and proved\nthat A. keveioides was a distinctive member lacking close relatives\namong described species of sect.
