Although some taxonomic confusion in\nthe family has been clarified, rDNA data alone is unable to resolve\nhigher level phylogenetic relationships within Mortierellaceae. In this\nstudy, we applied two parallel approaches to resolve the Mortierellaceae\nphylogeny: low coverage genome (LCG) sequencing and high-throughput,\nmultiplexed targeted amplicon sequencing to generate multi-locus\nsequence data (MLST). We then combined our datasets to provide a\nwell-supported genome-based phylogeny having broad sampling depth from\nthe amplicon dataset. Resolving the Mortierellaceae phylogeny into\nmonophyletic genera resulted in 13 genera, 7 of which are newly\nproposed. Low-coverage genome sequencing proved to be a relatively\ncost-effective means of generating a high-confidence phylogeny. The MLST\napproach enabled much greater sampling depth and breadth than the LCG\napproach, but has limitations too. We present this work to resolve some\nof the taxonomic confusion and provide a genus-level framework to\nempower future studies on Mortierellaceae diversity and evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"314","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121946","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121946.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"315","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121947","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121947.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"315","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121948","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121948.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"282","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121949","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121949.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"191","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121950","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121950.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"279","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121951","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121951.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"221","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121952","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121952.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"290","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121953","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121953.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"311","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121954","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121954.phy"}]}
