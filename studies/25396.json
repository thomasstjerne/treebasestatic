Species in this genus are phytopathogenic, endophytic and\nsaprobic on different hosts. In the present study, leaf specimens with\ndisease symptoms were collected from host plants from Shandong\nPeninsula, China. The fungal taxa associated with these leaf spots were\nstudied using morphology and phylogeny based on ITS, TEF1, TUB2 gene\nregions. In this paper, we report on the genus Nigrospora with N.\ngorlenkoana, N. oryzae, N. osmanthi, N. rubi and N. sphaerica identified\nwith 13 novel host associations including crops with economic importance\nsuch as bamboo and Chinese rose.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nigrospora ITS TEF1 TUB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121656.phy"}]}
