The morphological\ncharacteristics of both taxa are described, and contrasted to other\nmorphologically similar fungi. To elucidate the phylogenetic\nrelationships of Parasarcopodium, partial small subunit rDNA sequences\n(18S) were generated from the ex-type strain, which revealed it to be a\nmember of the Hypocreales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphomycetes from Restionaceae, 1/3 MP trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5799.phy"}]}
