It causes diseases in a wide\nrange of economically important plants, including peaches. China is the\nlargest producer of peaches in the world but little is known about the\nColletotrichum spp. affect\u0002ing the crop. In 2017 and 2018, a total of 286\nColletotrichum isolates were isolated from symptomatic fruit and leaves\nin 11 peach production provinces of China. Based on multilocus\nphylogenetic analy\u0002ses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) and\nmorphological characterization, the isolates were identified to be C.\nnymphaeae, C. fioriniae, and C. godetiae of the C. acutatum species\ncomplex, C. fructicola and C. siamense of the C. gloeosporioides species\ncomplex, C. karsti of the C. boninense species complex, and one newly\nidentified species, C. folicola sp. nov. This study is the first report\nof C. karsti and C. godetiae in peaches, and the first report of C.\nnymphaeae, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, and C. siamense in peaches in\nChina. C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent species of Colletotrichum in\npeaches in China, which may be the result of fungicide selection.\nPathogenicity tests revealed that all species found in this study were\npathogenic on both the leaves and fruit of peaches, except for C.\nfolicola, which only infected the leaves. The present study\nsubstantially improves our understanding of the causal agents of\nanthracnose on peaches in China","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135061","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135061.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135057","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135057.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135059","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135056","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135056.phy"}]}
