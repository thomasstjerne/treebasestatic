Among substrate utilization\ntests, only proteolytic activity, almost absent in the spruce isolates\nbut usually present in the others, could be used for characterization of\nstrains. All isolates tested positive for the Bavendamm reaction and\nwere able to utilize soluble starch and cellulose. Electrophoresis of\nwater soluble proteins provided a reliable method to distinguish\nisolates from different hosts because electromorphs were host-specific.\nElectrophoresis of pectic enzymes allowed a more accurate\ndifferentiation of strains within host, but, on the whole,\nhost-specificity of electromorphs was confirmed. Amylolytic activity was\nabsent in ca 50% of the strains tested and the same electromorph was\nshared by roughly 80% of the remaining isolates. The results of this\nstudy support the hypothesis that distinct species of Leptostroma, which\nare morphologically almost indistinguishable from each other, colonize\napparently healthy needles of A. alba, A. balsamea, and P. abies.\nEcophysiologically all isolates showed biochemical attributes associated\nwith needle penetration and long-term residence within needles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"3","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptostroma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1420.phy"}]}
