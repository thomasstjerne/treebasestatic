Coconut palm (Cocos\nnucifera) is mainly cultivated throughout the coastal tropics for its\noil and other products valuable in food and fiber industries. Coconut is\ncommercially grown in more than eighty countries and India is one of the\nmajor coconut producers in the world. Stem rot of coconut caused by\nGanoderma is a lethal fungal disease of major concern for all coconut\nfarmers. The disease causes heavy economic damage in plantations across\nthe world and recovery of infected palms is rarely possible. Many\nspecies of Ganoderma have been implicated as the causal agents of the\ndisease. A study of the recent outbreak of Ganoderma rot of coconut in\nthe coastal state of India, Kerala, revealed the presence of two\npathogenic Ganoderma species. One of the pathogens was identified as G.\napplanatum, and the other was an unknown species belonging to the “G.\nlucidum” complex. In this paper, we give an account of the disease, the\ntaxonomy of the pathogens, and describe a new species of Ganoderma\ninfecting coconut palms in India based on morphology and molecular\nphylogenetic data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104192.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104193","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104193.phy"}]}
