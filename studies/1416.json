Potamodrilidae was regarded either as a subtaxon of\nAeolosomatidae, united with them as Aphanoneura, or entirely unrelated\nto Aeolosomatidae. Moreover, the groups have been placed in various\npositions within Annelida: as sister group of Clitellata, as a highly\nderived clitellate taxon, or excluded from Clitellata and not closely\nrelated to them due to great morphological differences. Although\nmolecular studies give strong support for the exclusion of these two\ntaxa from Clitellata their questionable sister group relationship to\neach other has not been addressed specifically. In the present study\nsequences of the nuclear 18S rDNA and the mitochondrial Cytochrome\nOxidase I gene were used for addressing this question. In addition to\nthe available nuclear 18S rDNA sequences, partial sequences of\nCytochrome Oxidase I of Rheomorpha neiswestnovae (Lastochkin,\n1935) and Potamodrilus fluviatilis Lastochkin, 1935 along with\nother polychaete taxa were determined. Combined analyses of these two\ngenes were conducted using Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Analysis. A\nsister group relationship of Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae is\nsignificantly supported in all analyses. As in previous studies a\nrelationship to Clitellata is not supported but the phylogenetic\nposition of both Aeolosomatidae and Clitellata within the polychaetes\nremains enigmatic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4546.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_244.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4542.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4543.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4544.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4545.phy"}]}
