Section\nSitopsis is comprised of five diploid species given the genome\ndesignation S. Four polyploid species are recognized that contain an S\nor S-derived genome. We have used two repetitive DNA sequences found\nprimarily in the S genomes of Triticum to determine the likely diploid\nprogenitors of the polyploid species. Comparison of restriction\nfragments that hybridize to probes for these sequences suggests that T.\nspeltoides is distinct from other members of section Sitopsis (i.e., T.\nlongissimum, T. bicorne, T. searsii, and T. sharonense). The S-derived\ngenome of T. aestivum is more closely related to T. speltoides than to\nthe other Sitopsis diploids. The restriction fragment pattern of T.\ntimopheevii is 98% identical to that of T. speltoides, while those of T.\nkotschyi and T. syriacum are identical to the group of diploids\nrepresented by T. longissimum, T. bicorne, T. searsii, and T.\nsharonense. Our results are compatible with previous molecular and\nbiochemical data regarding relationships among Triticum species\ncontaining an S or S-derived genome.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triticum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1562.phy"}]}
