These\ninconsistencies especially relate to the position of cetaceans and\nperissodactyls. Evaluation of the close phylogenetic ties between\nartiodactyls and cetaceans has been hampered by the absence of tarsal\nbones of primitive cetaceans, as artiodactyls are often diagnosed on the\nbasis of their tarsus. We here describe newly discovered tarsal bones\nthat are the oldest cetacean tarsals known. We present a character\nanalysis for primitive ungulate tarsals and evaluate their impact on the\nungulate phylogenetic tree. Tarsal data are consistent with some\nmolecular studies in suggesting that the extant sistergroup of Cetacea\nis Artiodactyla or that Cetacea should be included within the latter\norder. Tarsal data do not support Cete (Mesonychia plus Cetacea) and are\nconsistent with the exclusion of perissodactyls from paenungulates as\nsuggested by some molecular studies.
