One such\nway is to use creation science itself to demonstrate evolutionary\nprinciples. Some creation scientists use classic multidimensional\nscaling (CMDS) to quantify and visualize morphological gaps or\ncontinuity between taxa, accepting gaps as evidence of independent\ncreation and accepting continuity as evidence of genetic relatedness.\nHere, I apply CMDS to a phylogenetic analysis of coelurosaurian\ndinosaurs and show that it reveals morphological continuity between\nArchaeopteryx, other early birds, and a wide range of nonavian\ncoelurosaurs. Creation scientists who use CMDS must therefore accept\nthat these animals are genetically related. Other uses of CMDS for\nevolutionary biologists include the identification of taxa with much\nmissing evolutionary history and the tracing of the progressive filling\nof morphological gaps in the fossil record through successive years of\ndiscovery.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coelurosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55862.phy"}]}
