In this study, we characterized the\nsymbioses between mouthless marine ciliates of the genus Kentrophoros,\nand their thiotrophic bacteria, using comparative sequence analysis and\nfluorescence in-situ hybridization. Ciliate small-subunit rRNA sequences\nwere obtained from 17 morphospecies collected in the Mediterranean and\nCaribbean, and symbiont sequences from 13 of these morphospecies. We\ndiscovered a new Kentrophoros morphotype where the symbiont-bearing\nsurface is folded into pouch-like compartments, illustrating the\nvariability of the basic body plan. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that\nall investigated Kentrophoros belonged to a single clade, despite the\nremarkable morphological diversity of these hosts. The symbionts were\nalso monophyletic and belonged to a new clade within the\nGammaproteobacteria, with no known cultured representatives. Each host\nmorphospecies had a distinct symbiont phylotype, and statistical\nanalyses revealed significant support for host-symbiont\ncodiversification. Given that these symbioses were collected from two\nwidely-separated oceans, our results indicate that symbiotic\nassociations in unicellular hosts can be highly specific and stable over\nlong periods of evolutionary time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiont of Kentrophoros 16S rRNA RAxML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98151.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiont of Kentrophoros 16S rRNA MrBayes consensus\ntree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98152.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentrophoros 18S rRNA RAxML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98150.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentrophoros 18S rRNA MrBayes consensus tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98149.phy"}]}
