The type species D. ehrenbergianum formed an independent\nlineage within the Parachlorella clade, assigning the genus to this\nclade. Our study focused on three different Dictyosphaerium species to\nresolve the phylogenetic position of remaining species. We used combined\nanalyses of morphology, molecular data based on SSU and ITS rRNA gene\nsequences and the comparison of the secondary structure of the SSU,\nITS-1 and ITS-2 for species and genera delineation. The phylogenetic\ntree revealed two separate clades of Dictyosphaerium-like strains within\nthe Parachlorella clade. One clade comprises of the lineages with the\nepitype strain of D. ehrenbergianum and two additional lineages which\nare here described as D. libertatis sp. nov. and D. lacustris sp. nov.\nThe second clade comprises of strains with the D. sphagnale and D.\npulchellum morphotypes. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses,\ncomplementary base changes and morphological characters, we describe\nMucidosphaerium gen. nov with the four species M. sphagnale comb. nov.,\nM. pulchellum comb. nov., M. palustris sp. nov. and M. planctonica sp.\nnov. Based on molecular data, the spherical morphotype cluster in\ndifferent lineages of the Parachlorella clade and reveal new species. An\nemendation of the genus Dictyosphaerium is included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20750.phy"}]}
