The new species is\ncharacterized perennial, resupinate to effused-reflexed, woody hard and\ndark gray to almost black basidiocarps, the lacerate dissepiments, a\nmonomitic hyphal system, the presence of cystidioles and hyphal pegs,\nand broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 45.1 × 3.14.3 µm.\nMolecular analysis demonstrates the phylogenetic position of the new\nspecies in Nigrofomes. The discriminating characteristics of the new\nspecies and closely related species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Untitled","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nigrofomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121648.phy"}]}
