In these ecologically\nimportant associations, the fungi derive photosynthetic sugars from\ntheir plant hosts, which in turn benefit from fungus-mediated uptake of\nmineral nutrients. Early views on the evolution of symbioses suggested\nthat all long-term, intimate associations tend to evolve toward\nmutualism. Following this principle, it has been suggested that\nmycorrhizal symbioses are the stable derivatives of ancestral\nantagonistic interactions involving plant parasitic fungi1.\nAlternatively, mutualisms have been interpreted as inherently unstable\nreciprocal parasitisms, which can be disrupted by conflicts of interest\namong the partners2-5. To determine the number of origins of\nmycorrhizae, and to assess their evolutionary stability, it is necessary\nto understand the phylogenetic relationships of the taxa involved. Here\nwe present a broad phylogenetic analysis of mycorrhizal and free-living\nhomobasidiomycetes (mushroom-forming fungi). Our results indicate that\nmycorrhizal symbionts with diverse plant hosts have evolved repeatedly\nfrom saprotrophic precursors, but also that there have been multiple\nreversals to a free-living condition. These findings suggest that\nmycorrhizae are unstable, evolutionarily dynamic associations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5544.phy"}]}
