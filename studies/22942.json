In this study,\nsamples of microfungi were collected from symptomatic branches, stem and\nleaves of the mangrove species Xylocarpus granatum, X. moluccensis and\nLumnitzera racemosa and examined morphologically. The phylogeny\nrecovered supports our morphological data to introduce three new\nspecies, Cytospora lumnitzericola, C. thailandica and C. xylocarpi. In\naddition, a combined multi-gene DNA sequence dataset (ITS, LSU, ACT and\nRPB2) was analysed to investigate phylogenetic relationships of isolates\nand help in a more reliable species identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora CB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora ITS 1 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117299.phy"}]}
