A. tarimensis is characterized by subglobose to\nbroadly ellipsoidal conidia with slight longitudinal orientation of\ndiscontinuous color bars and ridges wall. A. tianshanensis is\ncharacterized by subglobose to broadly ellipsoidal conidia with low\ncolor bars and ridges definitely arranged in a longitudinal pattern\nwall. The validation of those new species is supported further by\nanalyses of the β-tubulin, calmodulin and RPB2 gene sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus isolated from clinical material","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107288.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus isolated from clinical material","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107287.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus isolated from clinical material","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107289.phy"}]}
