But only a small fraction of current\nmolecular systematic studies methodically examine and effectively\naccount for the potentially confounding effect of non-stationarity. The\nproblem is especially overlooked in multi-locus or phylogenomic scale\nanalyses, in part because no efficient tools exist to accommodate base\ncomposition heterogeneity in large data sets. We present a detailed\nanalysis of a data set with 20 genes and 214 taxa to study the phylogeny\nof flatfishes (Pleuronectiformes) and their position among percomorphs.\nMost genes vary significantly in base composition among taxa and fail to\nresolve flatfish monophyly and other emblematic groups, suggesting that\nnon-stationarity may be causing systematic error. We show a strong\nassociation between base compositional bias and topological discordance\namong individual gene partitions and their inferred trees. Phylogenetic\nmethods applying non-homogeneous models to accommodate non-stationarity\nhave relatively minor effect to reduce gene tree discordance, suggesting\nthat available computer programs applying these methods do not scale up\nefficiently to the data set of modest size analyzed in this study. By\ncomparing phylogenetic trees obtained with species-tree (STAR) and\nconcatenation approaches, we show that gene-tree discordance in our data\nset is most likely due to base compositional biases than to incomplete\nlineage sorting. Multi-locus analyses suggest that the combined\nphylogenetic signal from all loci in a concatenated data set overcomes\nsystematic biases induced by non-stationarity at each partition.\nFinally, relationships among flatfishes and their relatives are\ndiscussed in the light of these results. We find support for the\nmonophyly of flatfishes and confirm findings from previous molecular\nphylogenetic studies suggesting their close affinity with several\ncarangimorph groups (i.e., jack and allies, barracuda, archerfish,\nbillfish and swordfish, threadfin, moonfish, beach salmon, and snook and\nbarramundi).","trees":[{"tree_label":"TreeFinder Concat AGY","ntax":"214","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63690.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63691.phy"},{"tree_label":"EHHADH","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63692.phy"},{"tree_label":"GCS1","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63693.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPR61","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63694.phy"},{"tree_label":"IRBP","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63695.phy"},{"tree_label":"KIAA","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63696.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLL","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63697.phy"},{"tree_label":"MYH6","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63698.phy"},{"tree_label":"Plagl2","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63699.phy"},{"tree_label":"RH","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63700.phy"},{"tree_label":"UBE3A","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63707.phy"},{"tree_label":"UBE3A Like","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63708.phy"},{"tree_label":"ZN503","ntax":"192","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63709.phy"},{"tree_label":"RIPK4","ntax":"186","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63701.phy"},{"tree_label":"RNF213","ntax":"186","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63702.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rag1","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63703.phy"},{"tree_label":"SH3PX3","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63704.phy"},{"tree_label":"SIDKEY","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63705.phy"},{"tree_label":"SLC10A3","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63706.phy"},{"tree_label":"TreeFinder Concat AGY","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63711.phy"},{"tree_label":"ZNF536","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flatfishes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63710.phy"}]}
