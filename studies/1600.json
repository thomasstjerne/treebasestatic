There\nremain many conflicts between morphological analyses and hypotheses\nbased on DNA data, these being principally derived from 18S rRNA\nsequences. For this paper we have assembled a dataset for polychaete\nspecies with information for gene segments other than 18S rRNA,\nincluding 38 new sequences from twenty-one species. 18S rRNA data were\nalso added to this compilation if available for the species. In addition\nto 18S rRNA, five gene segments covering a broad range of polychaete\ndiversity were available. These are the D1 and D9-10 expansion regions\nof 28S rRNA, histone H3, snU2 RNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I.\nMaximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were\nconducted. Annelida and Mollusca were reciprocally monophyletic in\nmaximum likelihood analyses but Polychaeta included the cephalopod in\nmaximum parsimony analyses and the patellogastropod in Bayesian\nanalyses. When rooted on the Mollusca, optimal topologies from maximum\nlikelihood analyses showed a recognisable basal group of taxa, including\nOweniidae, Chaetopteridae and Amphinomidae. The six studied\nphyllodocidan families plus Orbiniidae (as the sister group of the\nscale-worms) formed the next most basal group. All analyses support the\ninclusion of Echiura, Clitellata and Siboglinidae within polychaetes.\nBayesian analyses show Echiura as the sister group of Capitellidae\nagreeing with previous 18S rRNA results, In contrast, Echiura formed the\nsister group to Trichobranchidae in maximum likelihood and maximum\nparsimony analyses. Supra-familial groupings consistently recovered\nwithin Polychaeta in the analyses are (i) Terebellida without\nAmpharetidae; (ii) Scolecida (excepting Orbiniidae); (iii) Eunicidae,\nLumbrineridae and Clitellata; and (iv) \u001aCirratuliformia\u001a (including\nSternaspidae) plus Sabellidae, Serpulidae and Spionidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes, AML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_567.phy"}]}
