Here, we further investigate the evolutionary trends within\nmyxosporean lineages by using 35 new sequences of the LSU rDNA. We show\na good agreement between the two rRNA genes and confirm the main\nphylogenetic split between the freshwater and marine lineages. The\ninformative superiority of the LSU data is shown by an increase of the\nresolution, nodal supports and tree indexes in the LSU rDNA and combined\nanalyses. We determine the most suitable part of LSU for the myxosporean\nphylogeny by comparing informative content in various regions of the LSU\nsequences. Based on this comparison, we propose the D5Â–30-end part of the\nLSU rRNA gene as the most informative region which provides in\nconcatenation with the complete SSU a well resolved and robust tree. To\nallow for simple amplification of the marker, we design specific primer\nset for this part of LSU rDNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 ML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6761.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2B ML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6755.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MP","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6756.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B MP","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6939.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A BI","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6898.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 ML","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6754.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B BI","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6781.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A MP","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A ML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6800.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 MP","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6776.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 BI","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxosporea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6913.phy"}]}
