Within Group I, species in the\nTillandsia bulbosa complex share a remarkable synapomorphy: a\npseudobulb. We sampled the 13 species of pseudobulbous Tillandsia\n(including T. intermedia) in addition to 18 species from the five groups\nof subgenus Tillandsia, and four species as outgroups to perform\nphylogenetic analyses of sequences from two nuclear ribosomal DNA\nmarkers (ITS 2 + 5.8S and ETS). Three combined parsimony analyses\nexplored the effects of indels treated as missing data, 5th character\nstates, and with the simple indel coding method. Results shows that 13\nspecies of pseudobulbous Tillandsia are placed within a group that also\nincludes other five non-pseudobulbous species. The pseudobulb habit is\noptimized as a synapomorphy for this group although with three\nreversals. Our analyses also show that sequence variation at ITS 2 +\n5.8S and ETS provided good resolution and indels are an important source\nof phylogenetic information regardless of coding method. All previously\nused chloroplast markers (for example trnL and ndhF) have been shown to\nbe almost invariant even among distantly related species in Tillandsia.\nTherefore, both nuclear markers assayed here are promising sources of\nsequence variation for reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships\namong species of Tillandsia and other Bromeliaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudobulbous Tillandsia species, ITS 2+5.8S and ETS\nsimple indels coding","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6625.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudobulbous Tillandsia species, ITS 2+5.8S and ETS\nindels as fifth state","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudobulbous Tillandsia species, ITS 2+5.8S and ETS\nindels as missing","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6067.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudobulbous Tillandsia species, ITS 2 + 5.8S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudobulbous Tillandsia species, ETS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6547.phy"}]}
