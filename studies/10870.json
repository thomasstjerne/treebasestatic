We studied nine species from ten populations of trees in the\nBursera simaruba clade (Burseraceae) and found that across habitats\nwater availability was positively associated with stem, wood, and bark\ntissue stiffness (elastic modulus E), likely the result of selection\nfavoring water and starch storage at the expense of support in dry\nareas. In most species, all with a conventional tree habit, stiffer\nstems and wood were associated with longer, more slender stems.\nDeviations from this relationship implied marked habit differences in\nthe form of B. instabilis, a tree with lianescent branches, and B.\nstandleyana, a rigid-stemmed hemiepiphyte, illustrating the necessary\nrelationship between size, shape, and mechanics in morphological\nevolution. Ewood and Ebark covaried positively across environments,\nwhile ontogenetic modulation of the mechanical contribution of bark\noccurred through variation in bark quantity, whereas wood varied\nontogenetically both in amount and E. In plants in general, some parts\nof the stem length-diameter-mechanics morphospace are occupied whereas\nempty regions, e.g. very short and wide stems with high density wood,\nare likely ontogenetically possible but not favored by selection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21540","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21540.phy"}]}
