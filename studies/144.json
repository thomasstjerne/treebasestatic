A. ANDERB., has been analysed\ncladistically by means of a computerized parsimony program (Hennig86),\nusing the Arctotideae as outgroup. The results of the analysis are\npresented in a consensus tree and one cladogram. Four major monophyletic\nsubgroups can be recognized: The Coleocoma group (3 genera), the\nPterocaulon group (3 genera), the Laggera group (6 genera), and the\nPluchea group (12 genera). All recognized genera are described and most\ngenera are supplied with taxonomical notes including comments on their\ntaxonomic status. Genera such as Blumea, Pluchea, and Epaltes are\ndemonstrated to be unnatural assemblages. Monarrhenus and Tessaria are\nboth closely related to the Pluchea complex. The old generic name\nLitogyne HARV. has been taken up for one species of Epaltes, the genus\nRhodogeron is reduced to a synonym of Sachsia, and the following new\ncombinations are made; Litogyne gariepina (DC.) A. ANDERB., and Sachsia\ncoronopifolia (GRISEB.) A.
