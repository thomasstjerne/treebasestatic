In the present study,\nsequence data for the ITS nrDNA region were used in conjunction with\nmorphological observations to resolve the taxonomy of species of\nBotryosphaeriaceae associated with Proteaceae. Neofusicoccum luteum was\nconfirmed from Buckinghamia and Banksia in Australia, and on Protea\ncynaroides in South Africa. A major pathogen of Banksia coccinea in\nAustralia was shown to be N. australe, and not N. luteum as previously\nreported. Neofusicoccum protearum was previously reported on Proteaceae\nfrom Australia, Madeira, Portugal and South Africa, and is shown here to\nalso occur in Hawaii and Tenerife (Canary Islands). Furthermore, several\nprevious records of N. ribis on Proteaceae were shown to be N. parvum.\nSaccharata capensis is described as a new species that is\nmorphologically similar to S. proteae. There is no information currently\navailable regarding its potential importance as plant pathogen and\npathogenicity tests should be conducted with it in the future.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae on Proteaceae, 1 of 1000 MPTs.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5332.phy"}]}
