These virulence\ngenes are predominantly located among repeat sequences, explaining the\nrapid adaptation potential of this pathogen. Here, we used an Ago1-GFP\nP. infestans strain4 to analyze small RNA (sRNA) associated events\nduring potato infection. We show extensive targeting of potato and\npathogen-derived sRNAs to a large number of genes, including 206\nresistance (R) genes in the host genome. Intriguingly, the single miRNA\nencoded by P. infestans (miR8788) was found to target a lipase-like\nmembrane protein-encoding gene StLL1 whose suppression promotes pathogen\ngrowth. miR8788 seems to be an ancient molecule, tracing back to strains\nfrom 1846, which highlights its role in abating the defense machinery.\nThat P. infestans exploit its sRNA as a new type of effector adds\nanother level to the already challenging crop protection efforts to this\ndevastating pathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LL1-tree","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118019","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_118019.phy"}]}
