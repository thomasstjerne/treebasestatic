Phylogenetic tools have increasingly been used in\ncommunity ecology to describe evolutionary relationships among\nco-occurring species. In studies of succession, such tools may allow us\nto identify evolutionary lineages most suited for particular stages of\nsuccession and habitat rehabilitation. However, to date these two\napplications have been largely separate. Here, we suggest that\ninformation on phylogenetic community structure might help inform\ncommunity restoration strategies following major disturbance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Schefferville_mrBayesOutput","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shefferville Mines MrBayes Output Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88611.phy"},{"tree_label":"Schefferville_DatedPhy","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schefferville Mines Dated Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88610.phy"}]}
