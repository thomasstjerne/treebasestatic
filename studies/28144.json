In the\npresent study, Phaeolus schweinitzii collection is for the first time\nfrom Khanaspur and Changa Manga forest of Pakistan. This species was\ncharacterized based on both morphological and molecular characters.\nUnder morphological characterization, both macroscopic and microscopic\nfeatures were investigated. On the other hand, molecular classification\nis based on the amplification of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA)\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Specimens of the P.\nschweinitzii were found on living trees of Conifer sp., which is\ncharacterized by sessile basidiomata and ellipsoid to oval-shaped\nbasidiospores. The basidiocarp is characterized by its non-laccate brown\npileal surface with a yellowish-brown margin. The phylogenetic analysis\nfound the sequences from this study to form a monophyletic strongly\nsupported clade with other Phaeolus schweinitzii sequences downloaded\nfrom the GeneBank with 100 bootstrap and 1.0 posterior probability. The\nfindings of this study have contributed to the biodiversity information\nand provide important information about the presence of the plant\npathogenic fungus which causes detrimental effects to the forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeolus and related taxa ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130668.phy"}]}
