Multilocus molecular phylogenetic data\nresolved the eight isolates of this pathogen as a genealogically\nexclusive species lineage within the F. burgessii species complex. The\nother two described species within this complex, F. burgessii and F.\nbeomiforme, produce abundant chlamydospores in culture and their optimal\ntemperature for growth is 30 C. By comparison, F. algeriense did not\nproduce chlamydospores under the conditions tested and it grew fastest\nat 25 C. Furthermore, F. algeriense differs from F. burgessii and F.\nbeomiforme, respectively, because it doesnt produce polyphialides and\nnapiform-to-globose conidia in the aerial mycelium. Kochs postulates\nwere completed in a temperature controlled incubator, where isolates of\nF. algeriense induced moderate crown rot on the susceptible spring wheat\ncultivar Norm. Fusarium burgessii and F. beomiforme, by contrast, only\nproduced mild symptoms of this disease. BLASTn searches of the\nwhole-genome sequence of F. algeriense strains NRRL 66647 and 66648,\nusing homologs of genes known to encode toxic secondary metabolites,\nindicated they have the potential to produce several polyketide and\nnon-ribosomal peptide mycotoxins. However, moniliformin and 2-AOD-ol\nwere the only mycotoxins detected by liquid chromatographic-mass\nspectrometric analyses of strains cultivated in vitro on a solid\nsubstrate. A PCR assay for MAT idiomorph revealed that MAT1-1 and MAT1-2\nstrains of F. algeriense were present in Algeria, which suggests this\npathogen might possess a self-sterile or heterothallic sexual\nreproductive mode.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium algeriense gkd","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107408.phy"}]}
