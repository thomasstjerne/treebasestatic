Xylaria subtropicalis is\ndescribed and illustrated based on morphological characters and DNA\nsequences data. This new species differ morphologically from the other\npenzigioid xylarias by the shape and size of the stroma, which is joined\nto the substrate by a narrow central connective and by the size and type\nof germ slit spores. Phylogenetic analysis based on nuc rDNA\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS), and segments of the 28S and the second largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), indicated that this novel specie\nformed a strongly supported monophyletic group clearly separated from\nother species of Xylaria. Illustrations of detailed macro-and\nmicroscopic morphology are also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"339","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110854","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110854.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111125","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111125.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111126.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"339","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111127","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111127.phy"}]}
