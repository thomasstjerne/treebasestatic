The species is characterized by producing pale orange to\nreddish-orange cylindrical to slightly fusiform basidiomata that taper\ntoward the apex and by cylindrical to suballantoid basidiospores\nmeasuring 7.0â“10.0 Ã 3.5â“5.0 Î¼m. In addition, it is associated with a\ngreen alga and forms a film-like thallus. Lepidostroma asianum differs\nfrom all previously-described species in its unique combination of these\ncharacteristics. Phylogenetic analyses of partial nuclear large subunit\n(nLSU) and small subunit (nSSU) ribosomal DNA sequences also\ndifferentiated it from other species. The cultural features of a\nLepidostroma species are also provided for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP2 (nLSU dataset)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP2 (nLSU dataset)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66965.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 (best MP tree)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum parsimony tree for the nLSU dataset of\nLepidostromataceae and allied genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66964.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP3 (nLSU dataset)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP3 (nLSU dataset)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66966.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP5 (nLSU dataset)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP5 (nLSU dataset)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 (Bayesian tree)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree of the combined dataset of partial\nsequences of nLSU of Lepidostromataceae and allied genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66970.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP4 (nLSU dataset)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP4 (nLSU dataset)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66967.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 (ML tree)","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood tree of the combined dataset of\npartial sequences of nLSU rDNA of Lepidostromataceae and allied\ngenera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66969.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 (Baysian tree)","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree of the combined dataset of partial\nsequences of nLSU and nSSU rDNA of Lepidostromataceae and allied\ngenera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 (best MP tree)","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum parsimony tree of nLSU (Best MP tree)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66913.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP1 (nSSU and nLSU combined dataset)","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum parsimony tree of nLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66912.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4 (ML tree)","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood tree of the combined dataset of\npartial sequences of nLSU and nSSU rDNA of Lepidostromataceae and allied\ngenera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66910.phy"}]}
