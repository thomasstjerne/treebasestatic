Recent phylogenetic work\nhas placed the Anthocercideae sister to Nicotiana. Two chloroplast DNA\nregions, ndhF and trnL/F, were analyzed and the phylogeny was used to\ntest the tribe’s monophyly, discover relationships within the tribe, and\nmake inferences on character evolution and biogeography. The\nrelationship between Nicotiana, Symonanthus, and the rest of tribe\nAnthocercideae is unresolved. Anthocercis, Anthotroche, Grammosolen, and\nSymonanthus are found to be monophyletic, while Cyphanthera and Duboisia\nare not (Crenidium is monotypic). Several characters were inferred to be\nderived within the Anthocercideae, including unilocular stamens with\nsemicircular slits, ebractiolate flowers, and baccate fruits. Ancient\ncolonization occurred in southwestern Australia followed by several\nradiation events eastward.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anthocercideae (ndhF data)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4143.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anthocercideae (trnL/F data)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anthocercideae trnL/F & ndhF data)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4145.phy"}]}
