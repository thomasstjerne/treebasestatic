Sustainable pear cultivation is negatively\naffected by European pear rust caused by Gymnosporangium sabinae. The\ncurrent knowledge on the variability of the pathogen and the hostplant\nresistance is insufficient, limiting the implementation of successful\nplant protection actions, development and selection of new resistance\nsources. The objectives of the study were to identify Gymnosporangium\nspecies occurring in Latvia on junipers and European pear with focus on\npossible hosts of G. sabinae and to assess their genetic diversity and\npathogenicity in relation to the host and geographic origin. Based on a\nlarge collection across the country, morphological characterisation and\nsequences of three loci, three species were found on the studied hosts -\nG. sabinae on Juniperus sabina and P. communis, G. clavariiforme on J.\ncommunis, and G. cornutum on J. communis and Sorbus aucuparia. Resistant\ngenotypes among seedlings consistently without EPR symptoms in\ninoculation experiments were discovered confirming the presence of\nresistance to G. sabinae in European pear. The methodology tested and\nobtained results in our study using artificial inoculation will support\nfurther studies of G. sabinae and European pear interaction.\nPathogenicity of G. clavariiforme on European pear was tested and\nconfirmed by inoculation with basidiospore inoculum from J. sabina. The\nmethodology tested and obtained results in this study using artificial\ninoculation will support further studies of G. sabinae and European pear\ninteraction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
