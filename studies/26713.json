In order to contribute to the knowledge of Chytridiales in\nBrazil, we isolated and analysed the morphology and phylogenetic\nposition based on the SSU, 5.8S and LSU rDNA regions of seven species.\nOur concatenate phylogram evidenced five lineages that fit within the\nAsterophlyctaceae, Chytriomycetaceae and Chytridiaceae, and two incertae\nsedis lineages. Based on the obtained results, we described two new\nspecies of Chytriomycetaceae, Rhizidium crepaturum and Siphonaria aurea,\nand recorded Rodmanochytrium sphaericum M. J. Powell and Letcher for the\nfirst time in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytriomycetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125137.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytriomycetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125138.phy"}]}
