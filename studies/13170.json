The taxonomic placement of the genus is discussed, and the\nevolution of our approach to species concepts and anamorph-teleomorph\nrelationships is described. The application of multilocus technologies\nto phylogenetic analysis of Colletotrichum is reviewed, and selection of\npotential genes/loci for barcoding purposes is discussed. Host\nspecificity and its relation to speciation and taxonomy is briefly\naddressed. A short review is presented of the current status of\nclassification of the species clusters that are currently without\ncomprehensive multilocus analyses, emphasising the orbiculare and\ndestructivum aggregates. The future for Colletotrichum biology will be\nreliant on consensus classification and robust identification tools. In\nsupport of these goals, a Subcommission on Colletotrichum has been\nformed under the auspices of the International Commission on Taxonomy of\nFungi, which will administer a carefully curated barcode database for\nsequence-based identification of species within the BioloMICS web\nenvironment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55840.phy"}]}
