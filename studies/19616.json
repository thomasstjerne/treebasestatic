However, neither relationships within Salvia sensu lato\nnor subtribe Salviinae have been evaluated using low copy nuclear gene\nregions. Here, we use two low copy nuclear gene regions (PPR-AT3G09060\nand GBSSI) to further assess relationships of Salvia and related genera\nwithin Salviinae. Our results largely echo results from previous studies\nbased on chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal DNA. Based upon the\nphylogenetic results presented here, previous phylogenetic studies, and\ntaxonomic, morphological, and practical considerations, we conclude that\nthe botanical community would be best served by maintaining a broadly\ndefined Salvia, and including the five small embedded genera\nDorystaechas, Meriandra, Perovskia, Rosmarinus, and Zhumeria as Salvia\nspecies. We subsequently present an updated circumscription of\nSalvia","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia 9060 renamed waxy MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102975.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia waxy names truncated MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102976.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia 9060 renamed with clones Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102977.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia 9060 renamed MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102974.phy"}]}
