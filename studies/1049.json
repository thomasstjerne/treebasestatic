All are saprobes with an initial endophytic phase. The North\nAmerican species L. seditiosum is considered a potential threat to New\nZealand’s plantation forests. Because these fungi are difficult to\ndistinguish morphologically, a simple molecular method was developed to\ndistinguish the four species. The ITS region is digested using HaeIII\nand HpaII in a single reaction, resulting in unique RFLP banding\npatterns for each of the species treated. Two genetically distinct\ngroups were recognised within Lophodermium pinastri, one North American\nand one European. All the New Zealand isolates of L. pinastri tested\nwere identical to the North American group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4199.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4200.phy"}]}
