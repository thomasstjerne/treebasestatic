We thus redescribed the type and fresh\nmaterial of Peltidocotyle rugosa Diesing, 1850 and P. (= Othinoscolex)\nlenha (Woodland, 1933) which appeared to constitute two distinct\nspecies. They differed in a number of morphological features: the number\nand layers of testes, the diameter of the metascolex, and the field\noccupied by the vitelline follicles. Phylogenetic analyses based on DNA\nsequences of 16S rRNA, 5.8S-ITS2 and 28S rRNA supported these results.\nPeltidocotyle lenha and Woodlandiella myzofer (Woodland, 1933) were\nconsidered conspecific after thorough morphological examination.\nConcerning host-parasite relationships, P. lenha was reported from two\nhost species, which is unusual for South American Proteocephalidea which\ngenerally display an oioxenous-type specificity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteocephalidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3436.phy"}]}
