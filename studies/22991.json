ITS, RPB2, LSU, and β-tubulin loci sequences were amplified and\nanalyzed using Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian methods. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of sequences of the β-tubulinRPB2ITSLSU nrDNA segment gene\nshowed that our strains were identified as members of Durotheca. Both\nmorphological and molecular evidence confirmed that three of them are\nnew species: Durotheca globosa, D. crateriformis. and D. guizhouensis,\nwhile D. eurima (≡Theissenia eurima) is a new record for China.\nDurotheca globose is unique in its subglobose to globose, and bigger\nascospores (42 × 36.5 μm). D. crateriformis differs from other species\nby its size of ascospores (13.5 × 5.5 μm) and crater-shape ostioles. D.\nguizhouensis shows unique small smaller ascospores (10.5 ×4 μm). All new\ncollections have been illustrated and morphological descriptions are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112691.phy"}]}
