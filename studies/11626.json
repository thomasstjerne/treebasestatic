This study was undertaken to isolate, identify\nand evaluate antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi from Rafflesia\ncantleyi, a Malaysian endemic species. Different parts of the flower and\nbud collected in Malaysia, Perak, were surface sterilized and plated\nonto potato dextrose agar. Fungal isolates recovered were cultured in\npotato dextrose broth for antimicrobial activity screening and solvent\nextraction. Fungal 5.8S gene and flanking internal transcribed spacer\nregions of rDNA were sequenced for construction of phylogenetic trees.\nEight endophytic fungi obtained from R. cantleyi were categorized as\nseven morphotypes. Three isolates inhibited the growth of Candida\nalbicans with IC50 values of 3.5-8.2 µg/ml for crude fungal extracts.\nBased on a detailed morphological study, the endophytes were identified\nas belonging to three genera, Colletotricum, Cytospora and\nGliocladiopsis. Phylogenetic analysis of fungal rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer sequences confirmed the three active isolates were\nColletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum sp. and Cytospora sp. while\nother isolates were identified as Colletotrichum siamense,\nColletotrichum sp. and Gliocladiopsis sp. Endophytic fungi isolated from\nRafflesia cantleyi produce bioactive metabolites which may contribute to\nthe plants medicinal properties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
