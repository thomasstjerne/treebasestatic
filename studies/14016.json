It is only the second known species of Brasiliocroton. Its\nphylogenetic position was inferred based on sequences from the nrITS and\nchloroplast trnL-F regions, using a sampling of closely related genera\nin tribe Crotoneae. Brasiliocroton muricatus was recovered within tribe\nCrotoneae forming a clade with B. mamoninha. This clade is in turn\nsister to the large genus Croton, giving additional support to previous\nphylogenetic studies including B. mamoninha. The most obvious\nmorphological characters distinguishing the new species from B.\nmamoninha are the unisexual, axillary inflorescences and the smaller\nfruits with muricate surface and white, stellate trichomes vs. bisexual,\nterminal inflorescences and bigger fruits with smooth surface and\nochraceous to brown dendritic trichomes in B. mamoninha. Both species of\nBrasiliocroton have the filaments of the staminate flowers erect in bud,\nthe main character distinguishing them from the closely related Croton\nand Astraea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62081.phy"}]}
