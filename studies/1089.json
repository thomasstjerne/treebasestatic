Cave organisms appear to be ideal candidates for studying\nconvergence in morphological, physiological and developmental traits.\nHere we report apparent convergence in two cave-catfishes that were\ndescribed on morphological grounds as congeners: Prietella phreatophila\nand P. lundbergi. We collected mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 10\nspecies of catfishes, representing five of the seven genera in\nIctaluridae, as well as seven species from a broad range of siluriform\noutgroups. Analysis of the sequence data under parsimony supports a\nmonophyletic Prietella. However, both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses support polyphyly of the genus, with P. lundbergi sister to\nIctalurus and P. phreatophila sister to Ameiurus. The topological\ndifference between parsimony and the other methods appears to result\nfrom long-branch attraction between the Prietella species. Similarly,\nthe sequence data do not support several other relationships within\nIctaluridae supported by morphology. We develop a new Bayesian method\nfor examining variation in molecular rates of evolution across a\nphylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cave Catfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1259.phy"}]}
