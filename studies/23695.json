In\nthis work we observed that echinoderms have 11-13 wnt genes and 4\nfrizzled genes. Echinoderms is characterized by the loss of Wnt family\ngenes. In particular all echinoderms besides Asteroidea do not have\nwnt11 gene, and Echinoidea do not have wnt2. Although the wnt genes are\nconservative, the amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins\nhave only 49-73% of the homology between the same proteins in deferent\nclasses of echinoderms, while the frizzled genes have a high degree of\nsimilarity - 63-76%. In addition, in present work we make the phylogeny\nanalyzes of the Wnt and Frizzled gene families","trees":[{"tree_label":"8MaxLikelihood_nucleo","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"8MaxLikelihood_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115171.phy"},{"tree_label":"1MrBayes_nucleo","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"1MrBayes_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115163.phy"},{"tree_label":"4NeighborJ_nucleo","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"4NeighborJ_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115167.phy"},{"tree_label":"9MaxLikelihood_amino_conserv","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"9MaxLikelihood_amino_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115210.phy"},{"tree_label":"18Frizzled_MrBayes_AK_conserv","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18Frizzled_MrBayes_AK_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115217.phy"},{"tree_label":"10Frizzled_NeighborJ_nucleo","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"10Frizzled_NeighborJ_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115211.phy"},{"tree_label":"16Frizzled_MrBayes_nucleo","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16Frizzled_MrBayes_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115215.phy"},{"tree_label":"13Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_amino","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"13Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_amino","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115213.phy"},{"tree_label":"7Frizzled_MrBayes_AK.tre","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"7Frizzled_MrBayes_AK.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115216.phy"},{"tree_label":"12Frizzled_NeighborJ_amino_conserv","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12Frizzled_NeighborJ_amino_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115212.phy"},{"tree_label":"14Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_nucleo","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"14Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_nucleo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115214.phy"},{"tree_label":"7MaxLikelihood_amino","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"7MaxLikelihood_amino","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115170.phy"},{"tree_label":"5NeighborJ_amino","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5NeighborJ_amino","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115168.phy"},{"tree_label":"2MrBayes_amino","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"2MrBayes_amino","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115164.phy"},{"tree_label":"6NeighborJ_amino_conserv","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"6NeighborJ_amino_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115169.phy"},{"tree_label":"3MrBayes_amino_conserv","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3MrBayes_amino_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115165.phy"},{"tree_label":"11Frizzled_NeighborJ_amino","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"11Frizzled_NeighborJ_amino","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115326.phy"},{"tree_label":"15Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_amino_conserv","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"15Frizzled_MaxLikelihood_amino_conserv","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115327.phy"}]}
