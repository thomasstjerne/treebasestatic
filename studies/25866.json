The aim\nof this study was to identify and characterize the causative agent of\nthis symptom. Morphological characters and phylogenetic data derived\nfrom ITS and LSU sequences revealed that this leaf spot was caused by a\nfilamentous fungus that fits well within the order Capnodiales and the\nfamily Teratosphaeriaceae. Therefore, it is here introduced as a new\ngenus and new species, Palmeiramyces chamaeropicola D.R.P. Pereira &\nA.J.L. Phillips. Furthermore, a new leaf disease is reported on\nChamaerops humilis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
