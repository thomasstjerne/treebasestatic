Molecular and morphological evidence revealed that\nOsedax belongs to the Siboglinidae, which includes pogonophoran and\nvestimentiferan worms from deep-sea vents, seeps, and anoxic basins.\nOsedax has skewed sex ratios with numerous dwarf (paedomorphic) males\nthat live in the tubes of females. DNA sequences reveal that the two\nOsedax species diverged about 42 million years ago and currently\nmaintain large populations ranging from 105 to 106 adult females.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bone-eating marine worms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1877.phy"}]}
