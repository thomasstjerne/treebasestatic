A total of 11 species (six Fusarium spp., and five\nNeocosmospora spp.) were isolated from dry root rot, crown, trunk or\ntwig canker or twig dieback of citrus trees. The most commonly isolated\nspecies were Fusarium sarcochroum, F. oxysporum and Neocosmospora\nsolani. Three new Fusarium species are described, i.e., F. citricola and\nF. salinense belonging to the newly described F. citricola species\ncomplex; and F. siculi belonging to the F. fujikuroi species complex.\nResults of pathogenicity tests showed this new complex to include\nprominent canker causing agents affecting several Citrus spp. In\naddition, two new species are described in Neocosmospora, named N. croci\nand N. macrospora, the latter species being clearly differentiated from\nmost members of this genus by producing large, up to nine-septate\nsporodochial conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP
