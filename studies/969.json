This study reconstructs genealogical relationships among some\noctocoral species based on published DNA sequences from the large\nribosomal subunit of the mitochondrial RNA (lsu-rRNA, 16S: 524 bp and 21\nspecies) and the small subunit of the nuclear RNA (ssu-rRNA, 18S: 1815\nbp and 13 spp) using information from insertions-deletions (INDELS) and\nthe predicted secondary structure of the lsu-rRNA (16S). There were\nseven short (3-10 bp) INDELS in the 18S with consistent phylogenetic\ninformation. The INDELS in the 16Scorresponded to informative signature\nsequences homologous to the G13 helix found in Escherichia coli. We\nfound two main groups of gorgonian octocorals using a maximum parsimony\nanalysis of the two genes. One group corresponds to deep-water taxa\nincluding species from the suborders Calcaxonia and Scleraxonia\ncharacterized by an enlargement of the G13 helix. The second group has\nspecies from Alcyoniina, Holaxonia and again Scleraxonia characterized\nby insertions in the 18S. Gorgonian corals, branching colonies with a\ngorgonin-containing flexible multilayered axis (Holaxonia and\nCalcaxonia), are a polyphyletic set of species. These corroborated\nresults from maternally inherited (16S) and biparentally inherited (18S)\ngenes support a hypothesis of parallel evolution of branching in the two\noctocoral clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gorgonian octocorals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gorgonian octocorals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5773.phy"}]}
