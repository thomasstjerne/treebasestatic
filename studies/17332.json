The poinsettia\nis largely known for its red bracts and green foliage, and is widely\nused in winter festivities around temperate regions such as Christmas\nfloral displays. A powdery mildew was found on this plant species in\nJava and Bali Islands of Indonesia in 2013. Morphological and molecular\nanalyses revealed that this species is new to science. It is an asexual\nmorph belonging to the genus Phyllactinia (syn. Ovulariopsis). The new\nspecies is described and illustrated as Phyllactinia poinsettiae sp.\nnov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllactinia poinsettiae ITS+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86496.phy"}]}
