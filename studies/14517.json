As species of this genus are\nphenotypically similar to some taxa in several genera, such as\nBoletellus, Leccinum, Strobilomyces, Suillus and Tylopilus s.l.\nbelonging to Boletales, its phylogenetic disposition has never been\naddressed. We analyzed four DNA regions, the nuclear ribosomal LSU and\ntef-1Î±, and the mitochondrial mtSSU and atp6 genes, to investigate the\nphylogenetic disposition of Veloporphyrellus. Although the monophyly of\nthe genus and its systematic placement within the Boletaceae was well\nsupported, its relationship to other genera was not resolved.\nMorphologically, Veloporphyrellus is distinguished from other boletoid\ngenera by the combination of the pinkish or grayish pink hymenophore,\nthe membranous veil hanging on the pileal margin, the trichoderm-like\npileus covering and the smooth basidiospores. Five species, including\ntwo new species and two new combinations, are described and illustrated.\nA key to the species of Veloporphyrellus is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65474","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65474.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65476","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65476.phy"}]}
