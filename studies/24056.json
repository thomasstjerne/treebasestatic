Here we describe four new species\nof Cortinarius with similarity to C. porphyroideus: Cortinarius\ndiaphorus, C. minorisporus, C. ostradsignatos, C. purpureocapitatus.\nThese new species are associated with Nothofagus spp. and have very\nsimilar morphology to C. porphyroideus, but are phylogenetically\ndistinct based on the internal transcribed spacer region and the large\nribosomal subunit. In addition, based on molecular evidence,\nThaxterogaster viola is synonymized with C. porphyroideus and C.\nviolaceovolvatus is recognised as C. porphyroideus var.\nviolaceovolvatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116177.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116178.phy"}]}
