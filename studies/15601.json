However, to date, neither the complete genomic sequence of\nthis species nor a systemic characterization of the vancomycin\nbiosynthesis cluster (vcm) has been reported. With only the whole genome\nsequence of Amycolatopsis mediterranei available, additional complete\ngenomes of other species may facilitate intra-generic comparative\nanalysis of the genus. Results: The complete genome of A. orientalis\nHCCB10007 comprises an 8,948,591-bp circular chromosome and a 33,499-bp\ndissociated plasmid. In total, 8,121 protein-coding sequences were\npredicted, and the species-specific genomic features of A. orientalis\nwere analyzed in comparison with that of A. mediterranei. In addition,\nthe common characteristics of Amycolatopsis genomes were revealed via\nintra- and inter-generic comparative genomic analyses within the domain\nof actinomycetes, and led directly to the development of sequence-based\nAmycolatopsis molecular chemotaxonomic characteristics (MCCs). The\nchromosomal core/quasi-core and non-core configurations of the A.\norientalis and the A. mediterranei genome were analyzed reciprocally,\nwith respect to further understanding both the discriminable criteria\nand the evolutionary implementation. In addition, 26 gene clusters\nrelated to secondary metabolism, including the 64-kb vcm cluster, were\nidentified in the genome. Employing a customized PCR-targeting-based\nmutagenesis system along with the biochemical identification of\nvancomycin variants produced by the mutants, we were able to\nexperimentally characterize a halogenase, a methyltransferase and two\nglycosyltransferases encoded in the vcm cluster. The broad substrate\nspectra characteristics of these modification enzymes were inferred.\nConclusions: This study not only extended the genetic knowledge of the\ngenus Amycolatopsis and the biochemical knowledge of vcm-related\npost-assembly tailoring enzymes, but also developed methodology useful\nfor in vivo studies in A. orientalis, which has been widely considered\nas a barrier in this field.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Isp-NJ","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72354.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72356.phy"},{"tree_label":"Isp-MP","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72353.phy"},{"tree_label":"MurE","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vancomycin-producing Amycolatopsis orientalis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72355.phy"}]}
