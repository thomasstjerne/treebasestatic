Relationships of subgenus Decaloba to the\nother four Passiflora subgenera (Astrophea, Deidamioides, Tetrapathea,\nand Passiflora) are investigated, as are relationships among the eight\nsupersections within subgenus Decaloba. Results indicate that subgenus\nDeidamioides is not monophyletic, with section Tryphostemmatoides\nresolved as sister to subgenus Astrophea, sections Tetrastylis,\nPolyanthea, and Deidamioides forming a clade sister to subgenus\nPassiflora, and section Mayapathanthus resolved as part of subgenus\nDecaloba. Subgenus Astrophea + subgenus Deidamioides (section\nTryphostemmatoides) is the most basally branching lineage in the genus\nfollowed by subgenus Passiflora + subgenus Deidamioides (sections\nTetrastylis, Polyanthea, Deidamioides). The Old World subgenus\nTetrapathea is supported as the sister to subgenus Decaloba. Subgenus\nDecaloba is monophyletic and contains seven major lineages that\ngenerally correspond to currently recognized supersections. Within\nsubgenus Decaloba, supersection Pterosperma is most basally branching,\nfollowed by supersection Hahniopathanthus + P. obovata. The New World\nspecies Passiflora multiflora, the type of supersection Multiflora, is\nresolved as sister to a monophyletic Old World supersection Disemma. The\nremainder of the former supersection Multiflora is paraphyletic with\nrespect to supersection Auriculata. Supersections Cieca, Bryonioides,\nand Decaloba are monophyletic. Within supersection Decaloba, two main\nclades are resolved: 1) section Xerogona + section Decaloba pro parte\nand 2) the remainder of section Decaloba. The molecular phylogeny\nsupports a New World origin for Passiflora, with two independent\nradiations to the Old World. Morphological synapomorphies are discussed\nfor the major clades, revealing frequent gains and losses in several\nimportant characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Parsimony Strict Consensus","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53592.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53638","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53638.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53636","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony Strict Consensus","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53635","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53635.phy"},{"tree_label":"nuclear combined strict consensus","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53598","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53598.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF parsimony strict consensus","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53596.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF parsimony strict consensus","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53595.phy"},{"tree_label":"ncpGS parsimony strict consensus","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53594.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chloroplast combined strict coconsensus","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53600.phy"}]}
