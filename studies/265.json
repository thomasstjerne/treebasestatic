Parsimony analyses of\nthe molecular data base indicate that Surianaceae sensu Cronquist are\nparaphyletic; inclusion of Recchia rendered the family monophyletic.\nThis placement is corroborated by a suite of morphological characters:\nan apocarpous (or monocarpic) gynoecium of bi-ovulate carpels with\nbasal-marginal placentation and a ventrobasal style, and the occurrence\nin all but Guilfoylia of a characteristic 3-layered endocarp. The\nmolecular data support a closer relationship between Recchia and the\nAustralian Cadellia than between the latter and any of the other\nAustralian genera. The molecular data suggest that the affinities of\nSurianaceae lie in a clade comprising at least Polygalaceae, Fabaceae\nand Quillaja.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rosid I + rosid II","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1331.phy"}]}
