Although there have been many different\nspecies concepts and methods proposed, researchers generally choose the\nmost appropriate concept according to their interests. However, each\nspecies concept has both advantages and disadvantages. In such cases, an\nintegrated concept based on evidence obtained from different species\nconcepts and methods is suitable for the accurate delimitation of a\nspecies. The biggest dilemma of integrated species delimitation methods\nis the inconsistency between species concepts and methods. Herein, the\nconcurrency of the different concepts and methods was tested to reveal\nthe relationship of the Noccaea densiflora species complex. Nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), chloroplast trnL-F, and\ntrnQ-5’rps16 regions were used in the BPP species delimitation program\nunder 3 different scenarios. ITS and trnL-F regions were used for both\nthe STACEY and TCS haplotype network analyses. In addition to\nmorphological measurements from different populations and vouchers,\nspecific bioclimatic data values were also used for the principal\ncomponent analysis. Based on all of the analyses, it was determined that\nonly 1 population of N. densiflora and N. microstyla was clearly\ndifferent, whereas rest of the specimens remain taxonomically\nuncertain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128370.phy"}]}
