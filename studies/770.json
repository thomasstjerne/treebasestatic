Analysis of ITS\nand rbcL sequences suggests that the New Zealand species are derived\nfrom a single common ancestor that arrived via long-distance dispersal.\nAfter the establishment of this initial founder population in New\nZealand, the hebes have undergone at least two major episodes of\ndiversification, giving rise to six clades. The great degree of\nmorphological diversity in the New Zealand hebes contrasts with a\ncorresponding low level of sequence divergence. New Zealand was a source\nof new emigrants to other regions in the South Pacific that were\npreadapted to high mountains or forest margins. Our results suggest that\ntwo instances of long-distance dispersal from New Zealand to South\nAmerica, at least one instance from New Zealand to Australia, and one\ninstance from New Zealand to New Guinea have occurred relatively\nrecently. Shorter hops to the Chatham Islands and the subantarctic\nislands are also supported by the sequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antirrhinaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3848.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New Zealand hebes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3849.phy"}]}
