With the currently available data, however,\nrelationships within this clade are largely impossible to reconstruct\nwith confidence. Leightoniella zeylanensis was found to possess\nellipsoid ascospores surrounded by a thick, gelatinous perispore with\npointed ends, supporting a previously published hypothesis that such a\nperispore type is a synapomorphy for the Physma clade. A lectotype is\ndesignated for the basionym Pterygium zeylanense Leight.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian MRE","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae A2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109859.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pannariaceae A1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109755.phy"}]}
