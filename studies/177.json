This sample\nspans the morphological and geographical diversity of this poorly known,\nwoody genus of approximately 30 species, which occurs throughout the\nneotropics, with one species in Africa. Cladistic analysis of 38\nrestriction site characters generated 182 equally most-parsimonious\ntrees. The strict consensus tree preserved four well-supported clades,\nwhich are incongruent with previous infrageneric classifications of\nAndira. None of these clades has been recognized by previous workers,\nand three are not marked by any major morphological innovations. There\nwere few restriction site differences between closely related species,\nbut two (possibly three) species showed intraspecific cpDNA\npolymorphism, which probably reflects processes of hybridization with\nsubsequent introgression, or lineage sorting.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andira","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andira","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4242.phy"}]}
