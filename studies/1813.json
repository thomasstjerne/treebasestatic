Previous studies reported\nthat a single, wide-host-range species, Schizothyrium pomi (presumed\nanamorph: Zygophiala jamaicensis), caused flyspeck on apple. In the\npresent study we compared morphology and DNA phylogeny (ITS, LSU) of 139\nfungal strains isolated from flyspeck signs from 39 apple orchards in 14\nMidwestern and eastern states (USA). Parsimony analysis, supported by\ncultural characteristics and morphology in vitro, provided support to\ndelimit the flyspeck isolates into four species of Zygophiala, two of\nwhich are known to be sexual. Three of these species are described as\nnew. Based on DNA phylogeny, species of Schizothyrium were shown to\ncluster with members of the genus Mycosphaerella in the Capnodiales,\nhaving similar asci and ascospores but morphologically distinct\nascomata. These data question the value of ascomatal morphology at the\nordinal level, although it appears to still be relevant at the family\nlevel, delimiting the thyrothecial Schizothyriaceae from other families\nin the Capnodiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zygophiala","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2794.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2795.phy"}]}
