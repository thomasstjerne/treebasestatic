A survey of endophytic fungi from different\nhost plants in southeast China revealed more than hundreds of Phomopsis\nstrains. Among them, three strains were characterized by low similarity\nof ITS rDNA and tef1-Î± nucleotide sequences with the known Phomopsis\nspecies. Based on a four gene (ITS rDNA, tef1-Î±, MAT1-1-1, MAT1-2-1)\nphylogeny and morphological characteristics, they are identified as a\nnew species, Phomopsis zhejiangensis. Bayesian and maximum parsimony\nanalysis reveal that P. zhejiangensis forms a distinctive clade within\nthe genus Phomopsis. This fungus forms smaller pycnidia, spindle to\nstick shaped alpha conidia and rarely gamma conidia in the culture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57920.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57921.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57908.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57871.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57870.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57872.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57905","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57905.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57909.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57910.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57907.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57906.phy"}]}
