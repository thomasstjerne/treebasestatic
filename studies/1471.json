S.\nminiensis is morphologically distinct from all others species in the\ngenus Sparassis based on scattered flabellae, which are strongly\nlaciniated and have an orange to rose-purplish basis. The basidiospores\nare relatively large in this species and the sporadic presence of clamp\nconnections is restricted to subhymenial hyphae. Molecular data from\nlsu-rDNA, ITS and partial RPB2 gene suggest a close relationship between\nnew species S. miniensis and S. brevipes, another European species\nproducing large fruiting bodies but no clamp connections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparassis miniensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2373.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparassis miniensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2372.phy"}]}
