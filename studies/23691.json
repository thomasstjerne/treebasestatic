However, no one reported those reliable pure\ncultures. Here we reported for the first time the successful isolation\nof mycelial strains from basidiospores in genus Hydnum. Basidiospores\nobtained from basidioma samples were aseptically inoculated onto\nmodified NorkranÂ’s C (MNC) medium, MNC containing n-butyric acid (n-MNC),\nor MNC with gellan-gum instead of agar (G-MNC). Although basidiospore\ngermination was observed in most samples, the isolation rate was higher\nfrom MNC (91.7%) and G-MNC (93.8%) than from n-MNC (36.4%). Most\nestablished isolates were monokaryotic and lacked a clamp connection,\nbut three were dikaryotic and had clamp connections. Established\nisolates were identified by molecular phylogenetic analyses of the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene. These results\nsuggest that basidiospores are useful to establish monokaryotic and\ndikaryotic isolates of Hydnum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115218","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115218.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115149.phy"}]}
