Included in four\ngenera, the 14 described species utilize phagocytosis as their mode of\nnutrition, and the life cycles of these taxa are remarkably similar.\nHowever, their putative specificity of host, morphological and\nultrastructural features, and genetic divergence have been considered in\ntaxon delineation. Here we examine the host specificity, morphology,\nultrastructure, and molecular 18S gene sequence of a new species in\nAphelida, Aphelidium desmodesmi sp. nov. This taxon is in a\nwell-supported clade with two other species of Aphelidium, and this\nlineage is sister to Amoeboaphelidium and Paraphelidium. Of interest,\nthe mitochondrial structure of Aph. desmodesmi is more like that of\nParaphelidium than that of Aphelidium aff. melosirae, the only other\nspecies of Aphelidium to have been examined ultrastructurally. This\nresearch examines and expands our understanding of host range,\nmorphological diversity, and genetic divergence of the aphelids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphelidium desmodesmi 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101126.phy"}]}
