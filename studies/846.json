To date 27 genera have been reported as anamorphs of\nMycosphaerella, 18 of which were included in this study. Based on the\nphylogeny of the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 rDNA sequence data, Mycosphaerella\nproved to be largely monophyletic. The major group consisted of several\nsmall clusters correlating to specific anamorph genera, as well as other\nclusterss containing an assemblage of anamorph genera. Although\nMycosphaerella is monophyletic, it appears that the morphological\ncharacters defining different anamorph genera evolved more than once and\nfor the most do not represent true groups within Mycosphaerella.\nNevertheless, the anamorph generic concepts contain valuable information\nof practical use to plant pathologists and mycologists working with\nthese organisms. Based on these results, as well as a re-evaluation of\nthe criteria upon which anamorph genera are distinguished in this\ncomplex, a reduced set of informative criteria and genera are proposed.\nKey Words: Cercospora, Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Mycovellosiella,\nPassalora, Pseudocercospora, ITS phylogeny Short title: ANAMORPHS OF\nMYCOSPHAERELLA","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 65 rerooted","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5549.phy"}]}
