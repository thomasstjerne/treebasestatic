These two species were both determined as Phellinus\nrimosus by former mycologists, but both are morphologically distinct\nfrom the authentic specimen of P. rimosus. Comparison with other\nFulvifomes spp. and some authentic specimens, we conclude that these two\nspecies are undescribed. Fulvifomes boninensis sp. nov. is characterized\nby the perennial basidiomata, sulcate pileus surface becoming rimose,\nlack of a distinct crust on the pileus surface, pores 46/mm, subdimitic\nhyphal system in the context, and ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 56.5\n× 3.55 µm. This species is endemic to the Bonin Islands, Japan, and is\nspecific to Morus boninensis, a red-listed tree species. Fulvifomes\nimazekii sp. nov. is characterized by the perennial basidiomata, sulcate\nand velutinous to shortly tomentose pileus surface, lack of a crust on\nthe pileus surface, pores 67/mm, dimitic hyphal system in the context,\nand broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.56 × 3.55 µm. This\nspecies is specific to Berchemiella berchemiaefolia, and known only from\nMt. Yokogura-yama, in Kochi prefecture, Japan. Fulvifomes boninensis and\nF. imazekii are considered threatened, because of the high specificity\nto a threatened tree and the limited distribution for the former and the\nextremely small number of “mature individuals” for the latter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131734.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131735.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125449.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125448","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125448.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125447.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125446","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125446.phy"}]}
