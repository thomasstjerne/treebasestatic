The latter species, also collected in\nNew Brunswick (NB), appears to be restricted to the St. Lawrence River\nBasin. Mel-36 is described here as a novel phylogenetically distinct\nspecies, M. laurentiana Voitk, Burzynski, ODonnell, sp. nov. Prior to\nthe discovery of Mel-19 in NL, NB and Washington State (WA), it was only\nknown from central China and central and northern Europe.
