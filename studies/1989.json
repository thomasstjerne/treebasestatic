The gynodioecious species are\nfunctionally dioecious due to the impact of pollinating fig wasps\n(Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) on the maturation of fig seeds. The\nevolutionary relationships of functionally dioecious figs (Ficus subg.\nFicus) were examined through phylogenetic analyses based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and morphology.\nForty-six species representing each monoecious subgenus and each section\nof functionally dioecious subg. Ficus were included in parsimony\nanalyses based on 180 molecular characters and 61 morphological\ncharacters that were potentially informative. Separate and combined\nanalyses of molecular and morphological data sets suggested that\nfunctionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic and that monoecious\nsubg. Sycomorus is derived within a dioecious clade. The combined\nanalysis indicated one or two origins of functional dioecy in the genus\nand at least two reversals to monoecy within a functionally dioecious\nlineage. The exclusion of breeding system and related characters from\nthe analysis also indicated two shifts from monoecy to functional dioecy\nand two reversals. The associations of pollinating fig wasps were\ncongruent with host fig phylogeny and further supported a revised\nclassification of Ficus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COMB.5of8","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2968.phy"},{"tree_label":"MOR.bootcons","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2962.phy"},{"tree_label":"MOR.1of6","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2964.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS.1of208","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2967.phy"},{"tree_label":"MOR.strict","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2963.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS.bootcons","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2965.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS.strict","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2966.phy"},{"tree_label":"COMB.bootcons","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2969.phy"},{"tree_label":"COMB.strict","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2970.phy"}]}
