(Salsoloideae: Chenopodiaceae) is presented based on\nmaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analysis of nuclear ribosomal\nITS and chloroplast psbB-psbH DNA sequences. Our data strongly support\n1) the sister relationship of Camphorosmeae to the Salsoleae s.l., 2)\nsplitting of Salsololeae s.l. into two monophyletic tribes, Salsoleae\ns.s. and Caroxyloneae tribus nova, 3) the current status of most\nmonotypic or oligotypic genera in Salsoleae, 4) polyphyly of the\nBotschantzev and Freitagâ€šs (among others) circumscriptions of Salsola,\nwhich falls into ten (on average) monophyletic genera/lineages. Three\nwell-supported genera are described as new, including Pyankovia,\nKaviria, and Turania, and four previously described genera are\nresurrected, including Caroxylon, Climacoptera, Kali, and Xylosalsola.\nSalsola s.s. include a group of central and southwest Asian and north\nAfrican species which assemble Salsola section Salsola s.s., S. section\nCaroxylon subsection Coccosalsola, Salsola section Obpyrifolia, Fadenia,\nHypocylix, Seidlitzia, and Darniella. All species of tribe Caroxyloneae\ninvestigated so far have C4 photosynthesis of the NAD-malic enzyme\nsubtype while the majority of the species of Salsoleae s.s. are known to\nbe NADP-malic enzyme subtype.","trees":[{"tree_label":"psbB psbH","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World Salsoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_339.phy"},{"tree_label":"psbB psbH","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World Salsoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_340.phy"},{"tree_label":"combined","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World Salsoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2698.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World Salsoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2699.phy"}]}
