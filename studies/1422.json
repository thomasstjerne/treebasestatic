The 7 recognized eunicid families possess\nsclerotized jaws that include mandibles and a maxillary apparatus. The\nmaxillary apparatuses vary in shape and number of elements, and three\nmain types are recognized in extant taxa: ctenognath, labidognath and\nprionognath. Ctenognath jaws are usually considered to represent the\nplesiomorphic state of Eunicida, whereas taxa with labidognath and\nprionognath are thought to form a derived monophyletic assemblage.\nHowever, this hypothesis has never been tested in a statistical\nframework even though it holds considerable importance for understanding\nannelid phylogeny and possibly lophotrochozoan evolution because\nEunicida has the best annelid fossil record. Therefore, we used maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian inference approaches to reconstruct Eunicida\nphylogeny using sequence data from nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA genes and\nmitochondrial 16S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes.\nAdditionally, we conducted three different tests to investigate\nsuitability of combining data sets. Incongruence Length Difference (ILD)\nand Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test comparisons of resultant trees under\ndifferent data partitions have been widely used previously, but do not\ngive a good indication as to which nodes may be causing the conflict.\nThus, we developed a Partition Addition Bootstrap Alteration (PABA)\napproach that evaluates congruence or conflict for any given node by\ndetermining how bootstrap scores are altered when different data\npartitions are added. PABA shows the contribution of each partition to\nthe phylogeny obtained in the combined analysis. Generally the ILD test\nperformed worse than the other approaches in detecting incongruence.\nBoth PABA and the SH approach indicated the 28S and COI data sets add\nconflicting signal, but PABA is more informative for elucidating which\ndata partition may be misleading a given node. All our analyses indicate\nthat the monophyly of the labidognath/prionognath taxa and even a\nlabidognath clade (i.e., a „Eunicidae‰/Onuphidae/Lumbrineridae clade) is\nsignificantly rejected. We show that the definition of both the\nlabidognath and ctenognath jaw type does not address adequately the\nvariation within Eunicida and thus misleads our current evolutionary\nunderstanding. Based on the presented results a symmetric maxillary\napparatus with a carrier and 4 to 6 maxillae is most likely the\nplesiomorphic condition for Eunicida.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 COI 21 taxa","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_245.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figj. 4 18S 16S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_492.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S 23 taxa 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2265.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S 23 taxa 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2266.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2262.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 COI","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2263.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2264.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S COI","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4560.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 COI 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4557.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S COI","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4558.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4559.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4551.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S 16S COI","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S 16S 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 18S COI 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S COI 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 16S 28S","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4556.phy"}]}
