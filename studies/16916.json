Each of their\nvariants may have evolved once or several times, suggesting that their\nrepeated appearance may be due to environmental pressures. The North\nAmerican Manihot species are an excellent system to detect possible\nadaptations and to assess the effect of mono or polyphyly on\nclassification. With 20 species, this group includes several growth\nforms, from tuberous herbs to trees. The monophyly of this group and its\nrelationship with the economically important M. esculenta, were tested\nfor first time with complete sampling of North American species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"First Bayesian separate analysis of all the sequences\nof PEPC","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Data Supplement S5","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian phylogeny of Manihot based on sequences of\npsbA-trnH, trnL-trnF, PEPC, a North American version of G3pdh, and a\nNorth and South American version of G3pdh","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 5.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85683.phy"},{"tree_label":"First Bayesian separate analysis of all our sequences\nof a North American version of G3pdh, and the sequences of a North and\nSouth American version of G3pdh obtained by ChacÃ³n et al. (2008) and\nDuputiÃ© et al. (2011)","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Data Supplement S4","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80814.phy"}]}
