Oidiodendron maius Zn is an ericoid mycorrhizal\nfungus previously shown to be highly tolerant to zinc thanks to\nantioxidative enzymes and membrane transporters. A novel gene, OmFCR1,\nwas recently identified from this fungus because it conferred strong\ncadmium tolerance when expressed in yeast. OmFCR1 codes for a protein\nbelonging to the PLAC8 family and physically interacts in yeast with the\nmismatch repair system, involved in DNA damage repair. The O.maius Zn\ngenome also contains another gene  named OmFCR2  that codes for a\nprotein sharing with OmFCR1 the PLAC8 domain and other sequence\nsimilarities. In this work, we analyzed gene expression of OmFCR1 and\nOmFCR2 in the fungus O. maius Zn when exposed to cadmium, the ability of\nOmFCR2 to confer cadmium tolerance when expressed in yeast, and the\ngrowth of OmFCR1-null mutants of O. maius Zn upon cadmium exposure.\nAlthough OmFCR2 was also able to confer some cadmium tolerance to yeast,\nthe different expression pattern of these two genes would suggests\ndifferent roles in O. maius Zn.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oidiodendron maius PLAC8 containing proteins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70176.phy"}]}
