They belong to different\nfungal genera within the Pleosporales. Several isolates were obtained on\nwood of different Prunus species (plum, peach and nectarine) from South\nAfrica, on Actinidia species from Italy and on Laurus nobilis from\nTurkey. Morphological and cultural characteristics as well as DNA\nsequence data (5.8S nrDNA, ITS1, ITS2, partial SSU nrDNA) were used to\ncharacterise them. The isolates belonged to three species of the\nrecently established genus Paraconiothyrium. This is the first report of\nParaconiothyrium brasiliense on Prunus spp. from South Africa. Two new\nspecies are described, namely Paraconiothyrium variabile sp. nov. on\nPrunus persica and Prunus salicina from South Africa, on Actinidia spp.\nfrom Italy and on Laurus nobilis from Turkey. A further species,\nParaconiothyrium africanum sp. nov. is described on Prunus persica from\nSouth Africa. Although other known species of Paraconiothyrium commonly\nproduce aseptate conidia, those of P. africanum and P. hawaiiense comb.\nnov. are predominantly two-celled.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paraconiothyrium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5098.phy"}]}
