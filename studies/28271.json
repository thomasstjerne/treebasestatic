This paper\nis a continuation of the work on ‘Taxonomic studies of some often\nover-looked Diaporthomycetidae and Sordariomycetidae’. We provide\ndescriptions, notes and figures or drawings for 71 genera belonging to\nseven families in Hypocreomycetidae based on type materials, authentic\nspecimens or literature. The taxonomic placement of the genera are\nre-defined based on morphology and/or phylogenetic analysis based on a\nmodern taxonomy. Two new genera, Neocryptosphaerella and\nPseudocryptosphaerella are described. Seven new combinations proposed\nare Fracchiaea myricoides, Neocryptosphaerella celata, N. globosa,\nPseudocryptosphaerella elliptica, P. castaricensis, P. cylindriformis\nand P. malindensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131100.phy"}]}
