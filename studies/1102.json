Here we report the first molecular genetic\nevidence for both unidirectional and reciprocal interspecific\nhybridization within Bursera. Phylogenies of hybrids and other species\nin B. subgenus Bursera are reconstructed based on nuclear and\nchloroplast sequence data. Compelling evidence supports the hybrid\norigin of three endemic Hispaniolan species: B. brunea (B. nashii x B.\nsimaruba), B. gracilipes (B. spinescens x B. simaruba) and B. ovata (B.\nsimaruba x B. spinescens). Cloning studies of nuclear markers from B.\novata suggest that this species is an introgressed or later backcross\ngeneration hybrid and thus reproduces sexually.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera ETS condensed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_216.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera PEPC intron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera rps16 intron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_448.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera psbA-trnH spacer","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera ETS all clones","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1690.phy"}]}
