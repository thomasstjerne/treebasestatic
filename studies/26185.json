(Polyporales,\nBasidiomycota) with emphasis on Chinese collections and descriptions of\nnine new species","Journal":" Mycosphere","Volume":" 11","Issue":" 1","Pages":" 1527-1552","Keywords":" corticioid fungi  Phanerochaetaceae  phlebioid fungi \nwhite rot","DOI":" 10.5943/mycosphere/11/1/12","Abstract":" The taxonomy of Phanerochaete sensu stricto is studied\nherein by using both morphological and molecular methods. Phylogenetic\nanalyses are based on a concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and nrLSU sequence\ndata of 50 taxa of Phanerochaete s.s. around the world. Among these are\nnine newly described and illustrated species  P. burdsallii, P. cinerea,\nP. hymenochaetoides, P. leptocystidiata, P. metuloidea, P. minor, P.\nsinensis, P. subrosea and P. yunnanensis. While P. burdsallii is from\nthe U.S.A., the other new species were collected from China. In\naddition, nine species, P. bambucicola, P. citrinosanguinea, P.\nconcrescens, P. cumulodentata, P. ericina, P. incarnata, P. livescens,\nP. magnoliae and P. taiwaniana are reported from mainland China for the\nfirst time. So far, 28 species of Phanerochaete s.s. from mainland China\nare confirmed by morphology and DNA sequence data. An identification key\nto all these species is presented. Phanerochaete fusca is determined to\nbe a synonym of P. porostereoides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete sensu stricto","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135414.phy"}]}
