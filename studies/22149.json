Three new Archilina\nspecies came from the Canary Islands. Two of them have the cirrus\nprovided with a stylet, cylindrical in Archilina regina sp. nov. and\nspike-like in Archilina imperatrix sp. nov. Both species lack a vaginal\npore: ventrally to the bursa, an area of vacuolar parenchyma is present.\nArchilina coronata sp. nov. lacks a stylet and has a vaginal pore. The\nthree species are sister taxa to Duploperaclistus circocirrus and\nDuplominona miranda sp. nov., from Brittany (France), characterized by\nan extremely long, tubular stylet, about 150 Î¼m in length. A further\nArchilina is described from Cabo Verde Islands, Archilina regisfilia sp.\nnov., with a funnel-shaped cirrus and without a vaginal pore. The\nfinding in the Canary Islands of closely related species, occurring\nabundantly in the same habitats and differing for presence/absence of\nstylet and vaginal pore, suggests a role of the stylet in allowing\ninternal fertilization in species without external vagina. The phylogeny\npresented, based on rDNA 18S and 28S genes, does not reflect present\nsystematics of the Monocelididae, and the monophyly of most genera is\nnot supported","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archilina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109550.phy"}]}
