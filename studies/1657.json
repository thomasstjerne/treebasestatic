Thirty-six taxa were\nincluded; these representing the three morphologically-based subgenera:\nPilosella from Eurasia, the circumboreal Hieracium, and Chionoracium\nfrom North and South America. Results from the trnT-F and petN-psbM\nsequence data strongly support the morphologically based\nclassifications. Exceptions include the placement of H. canadense within\nsubgenus Chionoracium rather than subgenus Hieracium, which may be due\nto chloroplast capture. Placement of the genus Andryala within Hieracium\nsubgenus Pilosella is also supported. Additionally, species in subgenus\nPilosella targeted for classical biological control are still supported\nas being in a separate subgenus from native North American taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict Tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hieracium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2594.phy"}]}
