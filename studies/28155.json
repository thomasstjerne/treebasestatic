Kuntze) in Taiwan and\nprovides the first global checklist of Botryosphaeriaceae species\nrecorded on this plant. Four Botryosphaeriaceae species, Barriopsis\narchontophoenicis, Botryosphaeria dothidea, B. fabicerciana and\nNeofusicoccum parvum were recorded from Camellia sinensis based on\nmorpho-molecular analyses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses using SSU, LSU, ITS, tef1 and\ntub2. Botryosphaeria and Lasiodiplodia are the most common species\nrecorded on tea worldwide. Comprehensive descriptions and illustrations\nare provided for the four Botryosphaeriaceae species reported in this\nstudy. These findings expand the knowledge of host and geo-distribution\nranges of Botryosphaeriaceae species in Taiwan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130692.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130691.phy"}]}
