While colour morphs among\ndifferent species appear to match in some geographical regions, in\nothers, there is little apparent colour matching. Mimicry is a potential\nexplanation for covariation in colour patterns, but it is not clear\nwhether the degree of sympatric colour matching is higher than expected\nby chance given the obvious mismatches among morphs in some regions.\nHere, we used reflectance spectrometry to quantify elytral coloration\nfrom the perspective of an avian predator to test whether colour\nsimilarity between species is, indeed, higher in sympatry. After finding\nno significant phylogenetic signal in the colour data, analyses showed\nstrong statistical support for sympatric colour similarity between\nspecies despite the apparent lack of colour matching in some areas. We\nhypothesize Müllerian mimicry as the responsible mechanism for sympatric\ncolour similarity in Ceroglossus and discuss potential explanations and\nfuture directions to elucidate why mimicry has not developed similar\nlevels of interspecific colour resemblance across space","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceroglossus ground beetles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98182.phy"}]}
