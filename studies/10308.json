Two species are\nrecognized: E. andina and E. zanderi sp. nov. Barbula fuscula,\nErythrophyllopsis boliviana, Glyphomitrium ferrugineum, Tortula\nsemivaginata, and Trichostomum juniperinum are synonymized with E.\nandina. Erythrophyllopsis zanderi includes ZanderÂ´s (1993) concept of\nErythrophyllastrum andinum. Lectotypes for Barbula fuscula,\nErythrophyllopsis boliviana, Trichostomum juniperinum and, Tortula\nsemivaginata are here proposed. A new key, detailed descriptions,\nillustrations and a distribution map are provided. Maximum parsimony and\nBayesian analyses of chloroplast DNA sequences (trnL-trnF region and and\ntrnG intron) suggest that Erythrophyllopsis could be paraphyletic, with\nrespect to the genus Bryoerythrophyllum. A denser sampling and the use\nof other phylogenetic markers are required to better understand the\ngeneric and suprageneric relationships of Erythrophyllopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erythrophyllopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6872.phy"}]}
