They are nutrient-rich\nbiomass resources for commercial production if handled in time. In the\npresent study, we sequenced the chloroplast genome of U. flexuosa\nfollowed by annotation and comparative analysis. It was indicated that\ngenomes have highly conservation among Ulva spp., and highly\nrearrangement outside them. Though U. flexuosa is more closely to U.\nlinza than U. fasciata in phylogenetic tree, the average Ka/Ks between\nU. flexuosa and U. linza assessed by 67 protein-coding genes was higher\nthan those between U. flexuosa and other species in Ulva spp., due to\nthe variation of psbZ, psbM and ycf20. Our results have laid the\nfoundation for future studies on the evolution of chloroplast genomes of\nUlva, as well as the molecular identification of U. flexuosa\nvarieties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Complete chloroplast of Ulva flexuosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107253.phy"}]}
