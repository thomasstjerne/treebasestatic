This\nplacement is based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses of partial\nnuclear ribosomal 28S large subunit (LSU) and complete internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) DNA sequence data. Coniochaeta gigantospora is\ndistinguished from other Coniochaeta species in possessing unusually\nlarge, ellipsoid, nearly equilateral, olivaceous to olivaceous brown\nascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"D2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaeta gigantospora sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50383.phy"},{"tree_label":"D1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaeta gigantospora sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50382.phy"},{"tree_label":"D3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaeta gigantospora sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50384.phy"}]}
