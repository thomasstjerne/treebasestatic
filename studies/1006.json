Phalacroseris, endemic to California, with a single\nspecies (P. bolanderi), is sister to a well-supported (>95%\nbootstrap) clade that includes all other principally North American\ngenera (plus Picrosia). The seven clades with major support and their\ncomponent genera are: 1) the Lygodesmia Clade: Chaetadelpha, Lygodesmia,\nand Shinnersoseris; 2) the Pinaropappus Clade: Marshalljohnstonia and\nPinaropappus; 3) the Pyrrhopappus Clade: Picrosia and Pyrrhopappus; 4)\nthe Microseris Clade: Agoseris, Microseris, Nothocalais, Stebbinsoseris,\nand Uropappus; 5) the Stephanomeria Clade: Munzothamnus, Pleiacanthus,\nPrenanthella, Rafinesquia, and Stephanomeria; 6) the Malacothrix 1\nClade: Atrichoseris and various species of Malacothrix; and 7) the\nMalacothrix 2 Clade: Anisocoma, Calycoseris, and various other species\nof Malacothrix. The rDNA sequence data provide < 80% bootstrap\nsupport for larger groups that combine two or more of the seven major\nclades, except for one uniting all 24 ingroup genera and one uniting the\nLygodesmia Clade and Pyrrhopappus Clade. The present analysis shows that\nMalacothrix, a genus of 22 species, is not monophyletic. None of the\nclades corresponds precisely to a suprageneric taxon of Cichorieae\nproposed previously, although taxa constituting each clade belong to a\ncommon subtribe or subgroup in classifications by Bremer, Jeffrey, and\nStebbins, with two to three exceptions. As a group, the 24 genera\nrepresent a single, major radiation of Cichorieae based in North\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4131.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4132.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4133.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4134.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4135.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Cichorieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4136.phy"}]}
