Dry gasteroids from Patagonia, in turn, were\nnot studied in depth in the molecular era. They constitute a different\nmorpho ecological group with anemocoric spore dispersal and without\nknown mutualistic association with plants. These features suggest that\ntheir biogeography must be different in terms of dispersal abilities and\nlack of co-occurrence with tree hosts. The aim of this work is to sketch\na preliminary filiation of some records made in central Patagonia,\nproviding accurately identified vouchers associated to molecular\nmarkers. Based on these results and previous records, morpho anatomical\ntraits are evaluated as well as their similarities and possible\nconspecificity with close taxa from far locations. The biology of this\nmorpho ecological group is briefly compared with the ectomycorrhizal\ngasteroid fungi. As a result of this research, the importance of the\nstudy of historic collections seem to be of paramount importance when\ntrying to discern recent species introduction in this group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119415","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119415.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119417","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119417.phy"}]}
