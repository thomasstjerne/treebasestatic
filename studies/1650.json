Both the subtribe as a whole, and the\nphylogenetic radiation of largely herbaceous genera around Asclepias are\nmonophyletic and well supported. While resolution within the Asclepias\ncomplex is limited, the lineages identified demonstrate that current\ngeneric delimitation is unsatisfactory. Asclepias should either be\nrestricted to New World members of the subtribe, or expanded to\nencompass the entire radiation. In the African species, it is shown that\nalthough the corona is taxonomically important for recognizing species,\nit can be misleading as an indicator of phylogenetic relationship.\nVegetative similarities often prove a more reliable guide, but more\ndetailed studies are needed to refine these lineages and to detect\nmorphological characters to aid in their practical recognition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asclepiadinae, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2574.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asclepiadinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Taberlet","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asclepiadinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2576.phy"}]}
