The suborder\nPleosporineae is emended to include four families, viz. Didymellaceae,\nLeptosphaeriaceae, Phaeosphaeriaceae and Pleosporaceae. In addition, two\nnew families are introduced, i.e. Amniculicolaceae and Lentitheciaceae.\nPleomassariaceae is treated as a synonym of Melanommataceae, and new\ncircumscriptions of Lophiostomataceae s. str., Massarinaceae and\nLophiotrema are proposed. Familial positions of Entodesmium and\nSetomelanomma in Phaeosphaeriaceae, Neophaeosphaeria in\nLeptosphaeriaceae, Leptosphaerulina, Macroventuria and Platychora in\nDidymellaceae, Pleomassaria in Melanommataceae and Bimuria, Didymocrea,\nKarstenula and Paraphaeosphaeria in Montagnulaceae are clarified. Both\necological and morphological characters show varying degrees of\nphylogenetic significance. Pleosporales is most likely derived from a\nsaprobic ancestor with fissitunicate asci containing conspicuous ocular\nchambers and apical rings. Nutritional shifts in Pleosporales likely\noccured from saprotrophic to hemibiotrophic or biotrophic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6892.phy"}]}
