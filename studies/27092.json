The\nspecimens were identified as Rickenella fibula, representing the first\nrecord of the species for Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The species is\ncharacterized by bright orange basidiomes, pileus 35 mm diam, 1320\nlamellae and 12 lamellulae between two lamellae, basidiospores\nellipsoid, 4.87.2 × 2.03.3 μm and cystidia 36.551.1 × 5.28.4 μm. A\nmorphological description, macro and microscopic photographs, as well as\na distribution map of this species in South America and phylogenetic\ndiscussion are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126600.phy"}]}
