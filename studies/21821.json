This new species is\ncharacterized by resupinate basidiocarps, a poroid hymenophore,\npseudodimitic hyphal system, nodose-septate hyphae, four types of\ncystidia (capitate, acicular to cylindrical, subulate to ventricose, and\napically-encrusted), and thin-walled, colorless, smooth and ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony\nalgorithms were used to construct phylogenies inferred from the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. Morphological and molecular\nstudies, along with intercompatibility tests, confirmed the independent\nstatus of this species. Also, based on molecular evidence, six new\ncombinations to Xylodon is proposed to accommodate species originally\nclassified under Hyphodontia s.l. A key to known species of Hyphodontia\ns.l. with poroid, irpicoid or raduloid hymenophores is provided for the\nconvenience in identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"my","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107979","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107979.phy"}]}
