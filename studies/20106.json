(Basidiomycota,\nAgaricales, Psathyrellaceae), collected from urea treated soil of\nbroadleaf mixed forest in Vietnam, is described as a new species of\nammonia fungus. Morphologically this species is similar to Coprinopsis\ncinerea, but it differs in basidiospore shape. Phylogenetic analysis\nwith nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data also\nsupports this new taxon. This is the first report of a saprotrophic\nammonia fungus in Vietnam.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99508.phy"}]}
