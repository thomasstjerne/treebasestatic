The production of seedlings\nfrom these two forest trees in nurseries is severely aﬀected by fungal\ndiseases. Mor-phological identiﬁcation, sequencing analysis of three\ngene regions (TEF+ACT+ITS or TEF+TUB2 + ITS) and pathogenicity tests\nconﬁrmedthat fungi belonging to Botryosphaeriales are the aetiological\nagent of the diseases. This is the ﬁrst report of Phyllosticta\ncapitalensis caus-ing leaf spots on C. estrellensis and Botryosphaeria\ndothidea causing canker on C. ﬁssilis in forest nurseries in\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria ITS EF BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97608.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta ITS EF BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90518.phy"}]}
