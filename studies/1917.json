Phylogenetic analyses\nof mitochondrial genes suggest that androgenesis has arisen repeatedly\nin the Asian clam genus Corbicula. Two of these androgenetic species\nhave been introduced to North America. Multiple lines of genetic\nevidence suggest that although nuclear recombination between these two\nspecies is rare, mitochondrial genome capture is a frequent consequence\nof androgenetic parasitism of heterospecific eggs. Egg parasitism may\nalso rarely result in partial nuclear genome capture between closely\nrelated species of Corbicula, which provides a mechanism for the\notherwise clonal species to avoid the deleterious effects of asexuality.\nEgg parasitism among congeners may explain why androgenesis has been\nmaintained in Corbicula after fixation and has not yet led to population\nextinction. This mechanism also provides an explanation for the apparent\nmultiple origins of androgenesis in Corbicula as seen on the\nmitochondrial DNA phylogeny. We suggest that a single androgenetic\nlineage may have repeatedly captured mitochondrial genomes (as well as\nportions of nuclear genomes) from various sexual species, resulting in\nseveral distinct androgenetic species with distantly related mtDNA\ngenomes and divergent morphologies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"best ML COI","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_576.phy"},{"tree_label":"best ML 28s","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2881.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2880.phy"},{"tree_label":"best ML ITS1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4978.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian clam Corbicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4979.phy"}]}
