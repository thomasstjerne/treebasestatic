The pathogen was isolated and\nmolecular identification was undertaken based on DNA extraction from the\nmycelium, PCR (polimerase chain reaction) amplification with primers\nITS1/ITS4 and sequencing of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer)\nregion. Isolation assays showed a large presence of the fungus Cadophora\nluteo-olivacea (= Phialophora luteo-olivacea) on the symptomatic areas.\nMolecular characterization was conducted on 100 isolates and 6 CBS\n(Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures) references strains of Cadophora\nspp. by PCR (ITS1/ITS4)/RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism)\nanalysis with HaeIII, BstUI and TaqI, permitting the identification of\ndifferent RFLP groups. The ITS portions of 28 isolates, chosen depending\non the RFLP group affiliation and orchard location, were sequenced and\nBLAST analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS\nsequence was carried out including the sequences of some C.\nluteo-olivacea strains obtained in recent studies and some CBS strains\nof Cadophora spp. The molecular analyses mainly demonstrated the\npresence of two different strains of C. luteo-olivacea, types -A and -B,\nassociated with skin pitting of kiwifruit. Pathogenicity tests using\nspores of type -A and -B strains proved that both were able to produce\nskin pitting.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46392.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46394.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46393.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46395.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46396.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46397.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46398.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46399.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46400.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46401.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46402.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46403","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46403.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46404.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46405.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46406","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46406.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46407","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46407.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46408","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46408.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46409","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46409.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46410","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46410.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46411.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46412","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46412.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46413","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46413.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46414","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46414.phy"}]}
