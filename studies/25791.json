The\nphylogenetic analyses show that Terrestriporia alba sp. nov. forms a\nmonophyletic lineage within Russulales. The new family is characterized\nby annual and resupinate basidiomata, poroid hymenophore, a monomitic\nhyphal structure, and generative hyphae mostly simple septate, but\noccasionally having clamp connections, the presence of gloeoplerous\nhyphae and cystidioles, thin-walled, hyaline, smooth, amyloid and\nacyanophilous basidiospores. So far Terrestriporia alba is found from\nMalaysia, tropical Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Terrestriporiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122973.phy"}]}
