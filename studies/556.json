The objective of this study was to\nexplore this problem by examining a larger sample of Peziza species, by\nincreasing the length of DNA sequence analyzed, and by including in the\nanalysis additional genera in the Pezizaceae. DNA sequences were\nobtained from the 5â€™ internal transcribed spacer region, the divergent\ndomains D1 and D2 of the 28S gene, and most of the 18S gene of the\nnuclear-encoded ribosomal DNA. Maximum-likelihood analysis of these\nsequences indicates that Peziza is composed of at least two distinct\nclades: the first clade contains taxa with mostly smooth to\nfinely-roughened, eguttulate ascospores and Oedocephalum anamorphs, the\nsecond clade contains mostly taxa with warted, guttulate ascospores and\nChromelosporium anamorphs. Separate generic status for Kimbropezia is\nnot supported by the phylogenetic analysis and Peziza quelepidotia is\nsufficiently distinct to retain its original status as Lepidotia\nhispida. This study is the first to suggest a phylogenetic link between\nthe mitotic fungus Glischroderma, and the genera Scabropezia and\nPachyphloeus. Other hypogeous species that belong in the Pezizaceae\ninclude Cazia flexiascus, Terfezia arenaria and Terfezia\nterfezioides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peziza","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3459.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3460.phy"}]}
