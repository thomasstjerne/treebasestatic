The study included 20 species from the genus Anagallis; two\nspecies each of the three small genera Asterolinon, Pelletiera, and\nTrientalis; and 21 Lysimachia species. The result of a combined analysis\nusing all sequences supports an Anagallis clade that also includes\nAsterolinon and Pelletiera as well as two Lysimachia species, Lysimachia\nnemorum and Lysimachia serpyllifolia, making Anagallis paraphyletic in\nits present circumscription. The clade was not found when analyzing\nseparate data sets. The result contradicts earlier studies that indicate\na distant relationship between Anagallis s.str. and Anagallis minima\n(Centunculus minimus) and a close relationship between L. nemorum,\nLysimachia nummularia, and Lysimachia punctata. We also found strong\nsupport for a large monophyletic group of Lysimachia species, including\nthe monotypic genus Glaux, and for a basal placement of Lysimachia\nciliata and Lysimachia quadrifolia in the tribe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anagallis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2474.phy"}]}
