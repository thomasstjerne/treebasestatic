Diagnostic features include an epigeous, ovoid,\npyramidal-warted, durian fruit-like basidiome with gelatinized glebal\nlocules and a columella that turns indigo blue upon exposure, and\nsubglobose basidiospores with long, curved, thin-walled and collapsible\nspines. A redescription, phylogenetic analysis and comparison with\nallied taxa are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Durianella, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Durianella, BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5303.phy"}]}
