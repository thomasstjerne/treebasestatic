The aim of this\nstudy was to identify species of the genus Colletotrichum causing\nanthracnose in bell and hot pepper in northeastern Brazil according\nmulti-gene phylogeny and morpho-cultural characterization. The\npathogenic strains obtained from bell and hot peppers with anthracnose\nsymptoms were initially identified based on the sequences of GAPDH, ACT,\nCAL, β-TUB genes and ITS-rDNA region. Morpho-cultural characterization\nof the identified species was obtained from mycelial growth rate and\ncolony coloration. Besides measurements of size and shape of conidia and\nappressoria. Based on the combined datasets was identified that C.\nbrevisporum, C. scovillei, C. siamense, C. tropicale and C. truncatum\ncompose the current species complex associated with anthracnose of\nCapsicum spp. in northeastern Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic for gloeosporioides complex.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_100035.phy"}]}
