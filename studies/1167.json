Two genetically distinct\ngroups (I and II) were identified based on the ITS sequence diversity\namong the isolates, representing 34.6% and 65.4% of the isolates,\nrespectively. British Isles isolates occurred in groups I and II,\nwhereas North American isolates belonged only to group II. The British\nIsles groups of S. subterranea were associated with particular potato\ncultivars. The full length small-subunit rRNA gene of S. subterranea was\nsequenced and analyzed by both neighbor-joining and parsimony methods to\nclarify the taxonomic position of this pathogen. The results of\nphylogenetic analysis showed that S. subterranea grouped together with\nother species of plasmodiphorids and this group clustered with the\nphylum Cercozoa, an assemblage of filose and reticulose amoebae and\nphylogenetically related zooflagellates. The recognition of the\nexistence of different genetic groups within S. subterranea will be\nimportant for the design of plant breeding programs and in testing for\nplant resistance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spongospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1807.phy"}]}
