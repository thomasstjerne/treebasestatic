B. macrocarpa is characterized by big\n(18 cm in diam) basidiocarps, guttulate basidiospores and growing in\npure forest of Pinus yunnanensis inYunnan Province, Southwest (SW)\nChina. B. squamosomarginata is characterized by the presence of scales\nat pileal margin, stipe with a bulbous base, dentate pores, presence of\ncystidioles, and growing in forest of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica in\nLiaoning Province, Northeast (NE) China. B. tibetica is characterized by\nsmaller pores (3Â–4 per mm), presence of gloeoplerous hyphae in\npileipellis, and growing in forest of XXX in Tibet, SW China.\nPhylogenetically the three new species are neither related to each other\nnor to the existed species in the genus. Furthermore, main\ncharacteristics of Boletopsis species are listed. A key to accepted\nspecies of Boletopsis is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134678","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134678.phy"}]}
