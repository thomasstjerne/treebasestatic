In Ficus,\ndioecy and monoecy are strongly associated with different suites of\ntraits (tree height, population density, fruiting frequency, pollinator\ndispersal ecology). Although ~30% of fig species are pollinated by\nmultiple species of fig-pollinating wasps it has been suggested that\nco-pollinators are rare in dioecious figs. Here we test whether there is\na connection between fig breeding system and co-pollinator incidence and\ndiversification by conducting a meta-analysis of molecular data from\npollinators of 119 fig species that includes new data from 15 Asian fig\nspecies. We find that the incidence of co-pollinators is not\nsignificantly different between monoecious and dioecious Ficus, and\nwhile all co-pollinators in dioecious figs are sister taxa, only 32.1%\nin monoecious figs are sister taxa. We present hypotheses to explain\nthose patterns and discuss their consequences on the evolution of this\nmutualism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosolen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80041.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosolen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80035.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosolen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80039.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosolen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80036.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupristina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80042.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosolen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80043.phy"}]}
