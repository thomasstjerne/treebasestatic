Four species were\nidentified based on the analysis of ITS, GAPDH and BTUB2 genes. The\ndominant species was Colletotrichum fructicola (33/41 isolates) followed\nby C. theobromicola (6/41 isolates), both belonging to the C.\ngloeosporioides species complex. The other species, with one isolate\neach, were C. melonis and Colletotrichum sp. both belonging to the C.\nacutatum species complex. Surprisingly, C. gloeosporioides and C.\nacutatum, commonly reported as the cause of bitter rot, were not found.\nPhenotypical traits were useful to assign the isolates to a species\ncomplex, but not to identify phylogenetic species. Isolates of all four\nspecies were able to cause the typical bitter rot disease, but the two\nspecies of the C. gloeosporioides species complexwere the most\naggressive based on lesion size.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum fructicola ITS region + GAPDH gene +\nBtub2 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91174.phy"}]}
