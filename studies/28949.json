Families in this order\nhave classically been isolated from soil and dung, and two lineages\ncontain causative agents of superficial, cutaneous, and systemic\ninfections in mammals. The ecology and habitat choices of the species\nare driven mainly by abilities of keratin- and cellulose-degradation.\nThe present study aimed to investigate whether the ecological trends of\nthe members of the Onygenales can be interpreted in an evolutionary\nsense, linking phylogenetic parameters with habitat preferences, to\nachieve polyphasic definitions of the main taxonomic groups.\nEvolutionary processes were estimated by multiple gene genealogies and\ndivergence time analysis. Previously described families namely,\nArthrodermataceae, Ajellomycetaceae, Ascosphaeraceae, Eremascaceae,\nGymnoascaceae, Onygenaceae and Spiromastigaceae were accepted in the\nOnygenales, and two new families, Auxarthraceae and Neogymnomycetaceae\nwere introduced. A number of species could not be assigned to any of the\ndefined families. Our study provides a revised overview of the main\nlines of taxonomy of the Onygenales, supported by multilocus analyses of\nITS, LSU, TUB, TEF1, TEF3, RPB1, RPB2, and ribosomal protein 60S L10\n(L1) (RP60S) sequences, combined with available data on ecology,\nphysiology, morphology, and genomics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136072","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136072.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136070.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136064.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136065.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136063","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136063.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136066.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136071.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136073","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136073.phy"}]}
