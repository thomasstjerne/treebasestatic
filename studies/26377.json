The CZEUM is\npublicly accessible and contains 1044 cryopreserved cultures of\nChytridiomycota, Monoblepharidomycota, and Blastocladiomycota, with 51\ncultures being ex-type strains. We molecularly characterized 431\ncultures by amplifying the majority of the rDNA operon in a single\nreaction, yielding an average fragment length of 4739 bp. We sequenced\nmultiplexed samples with an Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION device and\nsoftware, which was capable of producing sequences identical to\npublished Sanger sequences. With this data, we generated a phylogeny\nwith an additional 451 published zoosporic eufungi sequences to produce\nthe most comprehensive phylogeny of these taxa to date. The CZEUM is\nthus largely characterized by molecular data, which can guide\ninstructors and researchers on future studies of these organisms.\nCultures from the CZEUM can be purchased by contacting the collection\ncurator.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3-13","ntax":"882","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131005","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131005.phy"}]}
