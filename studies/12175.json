Simultaneously, the risk of\nincorporating ‘noisy’ data with misleading phylogenetic signal has also\nincreased, and may disproportionately influence the topology of weakly\nsupported nodes and lineages featuring rapid radiations and/or elevated\nrates of evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50044.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50055.phy"}]}
