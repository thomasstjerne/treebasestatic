Both macro-\nand micro-morphological features of the new species were described and\ncompared with morphologically similar species in Panaeolus. The pileus\nhas a distinctive reddish brown patch at the center. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of nrITS data showed a distinct placement of the new species\namong the closest Panaeolus species, i.e. Panaeolus cyanescens (Berk\n& Broome) Sacc., Panaeolus cambodginiensis Olah & R. Heim,\nPanaeolus bisporus (Malençon & Bertault) Ew. Gerhardt and Panaeolus\ncyanescens var. bisporus (Malençon & Bertault) G. Moreno &\nEsteve-Rav. Both morphological features and phylogenetic data supported\nnaming our taxon as a distinct new species in Panaeolus. Color\nphotographs of basidiomata and micromorphological structures, a full\ndescription of the new species, and an updated phylogenetic tree to show\nthe placement of the new species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123391.phy"}]}
