In the present study, an intensive sampling of diseased\ncucurbits as well as tomato and bell pepper was done and the fungal\npathogens present on them were isolated. Phylogenetic relationships of\nthe isolates were determined through a study of ribosomal RNA gene\nsequences (ITS cluster and D1/D2 domain of the 28S rRNA gene). Combining\nmorphological, cultural and molecular data, six species were\ndistinguished. One of these (P. tabacinum) is already known. Four new\nspecies are described as Plectosporium citrullae, P. pauciseptata, P.\nplurivorum, P. ramiseptata. Acremonium cucurbitacearum was shown to be a\nsynonym of Nodulisporium melonis and is transferred to Plectosporium as\nPlectosporium melonis comb. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
