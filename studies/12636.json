These two\nspecies were found in Brazilâs semi-arid region and in Central Amazonia,\nand they are characterized by the nature of the mycelial layer with\naculeate tuffs. Geastrum echinulatum differs from G. aculeatum in the\nsize of the spores, presence of subiculum, and structural details in the\nmycelial tuffs. The phylogenetic analyses were performed through\nparsimony and Bayesian methods, using the atp6 and LSU regions. These\nanalyses confirm that both species are distinctly segregated from the\nother Geastrum species analyzed here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geastrum aculeatum sp. nov. and G. echinulatum sp.\nnov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52430.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geastrum aculeatum sp. nov. and G. echinulatum sp.\nnov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52431.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geastrum aculeatum sp. nov. and G. echinulatum sp.\nnov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52432.phy"}]}
