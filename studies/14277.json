This culture is described in this study as a novel species,\nbased on its growth characteristics, morphological, ultra structural\nfeatures and phylogenetic analyses. The growth characteristics and\nnutritional utilization efficiency investigated shows that the culture\nhas slow growth under anoxic condition.The SEM images of the fungal\nmycelia shows that it produces very few blastocondia and distortment of\nmajor ultrastructural features such as the mitrochondria, fat globules\nand cell wall could also be observed from TEM images. Phylogenetic\nanalyses based on the multiple genes which included the small subunit\n(SSU), internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and large subunit (LSU)\nof the nuclear rDNA, translation elongation factor 1α (EF1α) and DNA\ndirected RNA polymerase II subunit 2 (RPB2) was carried out. Phylograms\nwere also constructed from individual datasets belonging to the SSU,\nLSU, EF1α and RPB2 gene seqeunces. These results place the isolate as a\nnovel species within the newly defined class Tritirachiomycetes, within\nPucciniomycotina phylum Basidiomycota. Analyses including only the\nmembers of this class based on the ITS sequence was also carried out to\nstudy the placement of this isolate with a higher resolution. It also\nsupports the results that the taxa is a new species and is different\nfrom any of the known taxa within Tritirachiomycetes with good bootstrap\nsupport from both the ML and NJ analysis. Description of FCAS11 is the\nfirst report of fungal taxa belonging to class Tritirachiomycetes from\nthe marine environment. We propose to call this new species as\nTritirachium candoliense sp. nov., after the place from where it was\nisolated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64061","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64061.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64060","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64059","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64063.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64067","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64067.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64066.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64071.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64068.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64064.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64072","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64072.phy"}]}
