Here, we analyze 45 Cheilanthes species\n(23 from South America) and circumscribe Cheilanthes s.s in a high\nsupported clade that contains three subclades: 1) Cheilanthes\nexclusively from South America, 2) Cheilanthes from Australasia + South\nAmerica, and 3) Cheilanthes from Africa. On the other hand, the position\nof three South American species belonging to the informal ‘Cheilanthes\ngeraniifolia group’, were confirmed as a high supported group outside\nCheilanthes s.s. and within the Doryopteris clade; this group was\nestablished as the new genus Mineirella. The descriptions and\nillustrations of Cheilanthes s.s. and Mineirella are provided. Also the\nnew combinations for the new genus and a key to its species are\navailable. Additionally, based on the phylogenetic relationships\nobtained, we discussed the morphological adaptive innovations that\nsupport the different clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheilanthes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120386.phy"}]}
