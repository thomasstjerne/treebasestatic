It is characterized by the basauxic\nconidiogenesis in the asexual morph, with apiospores in the sexual\nmorph. In this study, seventeen isolates of Arthrinium were collected in\nChina. Based on their morphology and phylogenetic characterization, four\nnew species (A. circulare, A. cyclobalanopsidis, A. septatum and A.\nzunyiense) are described and seven known species (A. arundinis, A.\ngarethjonesii, A. guizhouense, A. hydei, A. neosubglobsa, A.\nphyllostachium and A. psedoparenchymaticum) are identified, of which the\nsexual morph of three species (A. guizhouense, A. phyllostachium and A.\npsedoparenchymaticum) and asexual morph of A. garethjonesii are given\nfor the first time. The detailed descriptions, illustrations and\ncomparisons with related taxa of these newly collections are provided.\nPhylogenetic analyses of combined ITS, LSU, TUB2 and TEF sequence data\nsupport their placements in the genus Arthrinium and justify the new\nspecies establishments and identifications of known species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128959","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128959.phy"}]}
