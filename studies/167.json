The species group comprises ten species of mostly\nnorthern South American trees and shrubs. Characters and character\nstates peculiar to Solanum are discussed in detail. A cladistic analysis\nof the sessile group yielded four equally parsimonious trees which\nrepresent two basic tree topologies. The consensus cladogram is composed\nof three main clades. Biogeographic analysis using the consensus tree\nrevealed no components in common to the three clades. Possible\ngeographical scenarios are discussed with reference to the geological\nhistory of northern South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1667.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10B","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1668.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1666.phy"}]}
