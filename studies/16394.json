The\nmany alleles at this locus exhibit a dominance hierarchy that determines\nwhich of the two allelic specificities of a heterozygous genotype is\nexpressed at the phenotypic level. Here, we uncover the evolution of how\nat least 17 small RNA (sRNA) producing loci and their multiple target\nsites collectively control the dominance hierarchy among alleles within\nthe gene controlling the pollen S-locus phenotype in a self-incompatible\nArabidopsis species. Selection has created a dynamic repertoire of\nsRNA/targets interactions by jointly acting on sRNA genes and their\ntarget sites, resulting in a complex system of regulation among\nalleles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arabidopsis SRK Consensus from bayesian analyses","tree_kind":"Species
