Their role as human pathogens is largely\nignored. However, the ability of some species to grow at high\ntemperature enables them to play an important role as opportunistic\npathogens. The family contains several genera and species that have\nnever been reported to cause human infection. Hereby, three new species\nare described; two belong to the genus Subramaniula and one represents a\nChaetomium species. Subramaniula asteroides was isolated from various\nsources including eye and skin infections as well as from the natural\nenvironment, and S. obscura was isolated from a toe infection.\nChaetomium anamorphosum was isolated from a kidney transplant patient\nsuffering from fungal peritonitis. All species described were previously\nmisidentified as Papulaspora spp. due to the formation of cellular\nclumps or bulbil-like structures, which are characteristic of\nPapulaspora. The isolates failed to form sexual fruit bodies and\nascospores remained absent, which is an unusual feature for the\ngenerally ascosporulating genera Chaetomium and Subramaniula; minute\nconidia from phialides were sometimes observed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86217.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86219","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86219.phy"}]}
