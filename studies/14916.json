{"Authors":" Bo Wang, Yun Yu, Long Wang","Year":" 2014","Title":" Penicillium fusisporum and P. zhuangii, two new\nmonoverticillate species with apical-swelling stipes of section\nAspergilloides isolated from plant leaves in China","Journal":" PLOS one","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":" 10.1371/journal.pone.0101454","Abstract":" Two new Penicillium species isolated from plant leaves are\nreported here, namely, P. fusisporum (type strain AS3.15338T = NRRL\n62805T = CBS 137463T) and P. zhuangii (type strain AS3.15341T = NRRL\n62806T = CBS 137464T). P. fusisporum is characterized by fast growth\nrate, apical-swelling monoverticillate penicilli, verrucose stipes,\nfusiform to oblong conidia about 3.5â“4Ã2â“2.5 mm and cinnamon-colored\nsclerotia. While P. zhuangii presents a moderate growth rate, it also\nbears apical-swelling monoverticillate penicilli but its stipes are\nsmooth-walled, and produces ovoid to globose smooth-walled conidia about\n3â“3.5 mm. Both species belong to section Aspergilloides, and P.\nfusisporum is related to ââP. thomii var. flavescensââ, while P.\nzhuangii is morphologically similar to P. lividum. Phylogenetic analyses\nof sequences of calmodulin and beta-tubulin genes both show that the two\nnew taxa form distinct monophyletic clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium fusisporum and P. zhuangii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium fusisporum and P. zhuangii BenA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74947.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium fusisporum and P. zhuangii CMD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74937.phy"}]}
