Analyses were conducted with and without taking phylogeny into\naccount. The former analyses were based on a weighted, phylogenetic\nsupertree for all extant species of lagomorphs that we constructed using\nmorphological and molecular data from 146 papers in the literature.\nAlthough our analyses represent an initial, somewhat crude\ninvestigation, several clear trends are evident. First, overall body\ncoloration across lagomorphs tends to match the background as shown for\npale and red coloration and perhaps seasonal pelage change. The case for\ncountershading being a method of concealment is far less strong. Second,\near tips appear to have a communicative role since they are conspicuous\nin many different habitats. Third, hypotheses for tail tips having a\ncommunicative role, for extremities being dark for physiological\nreasons, and for Glogerâ€™s rule received only partial support.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha (unweighted)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4041.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha (weighted)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4042.phy"}]}
