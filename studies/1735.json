One of the\ntwo fungi was identified as Xylaria angulosa on the basis of the\nmorphology of branched stroma produced on medium and tiny asci and\nascospores having germination slit. Another fungus is an anamorphic\nfungus that produces up to 50 mm long synnemata from which dendritic\nconidiophores branch out. Unicellular conidia are holoblastically\nproduced on a sympodially proliferating conidiogenous cell. Such\nmorphological characters resemble to those of the genus Geniculosporium.\nHowever, its distinctive synnema formation and dendritic conidiophores\ndo not assign the fungus to Geniculosporium or other known genera and\nwarrant establishment of a new genus. Phylogenetic tree based on the ITS\nregions of rDNA shows that the fungus is nested in the cluster of the\ngenus Nemania (Xylariaceae), whose species have mainly\nGeniculosporium-like anamorphs. We describe here the present anamorphic\nfungus as Geniculisynnema termiticola gen. et sp. nov., and discuss its\nphylogenetical and ecological relationships to Xylariaceous fungi,\nespecially termiticolous species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylariaceous fungi from termites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_509.phy"}]}
