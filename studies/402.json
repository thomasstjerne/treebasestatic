Previous\nhypotheses of relationship in the tribe were based on cytological and\nmorphological characters such as the presence/absence of awns, monoecy\nvs.Â andromonoecy, or inflorescence characteristics. Classifications were\nsubsequently proposed based on those ideas of relationships, and these\nare examined in the context of the molecular data. The notion that the\nbase number of the tribe is x=5 is tested using the phylogeny. Diploids\nwith n=5 are not conclusively the earliest diverging members of the\ngroup, but are nested high in the tree and the earliest diverging\nlineages in the tribe have n=10. Subtribal designations are not\ninformative due to the lack of resolution between clades in the strict\nconsensus tree. There are well-supported clades in the tribe, including\nthree Sorghum lineages and a core Andropogoneae clade, even though\nrelationships among clades are poorly supported. The topological pattern\nsuggests a rapid radiation for the group. A preliminary assessment of\nthe generic limits of the genus Sorghum show it to be paraphyletic,\nincluding the genera Cleistachne, Miscanthus, and a species of\nMicrostegium. Subtribe Sorghinae is represented here by Sorghum,\nSorghastrum, Cleistachne, Bothriochloa, Capillipedium, Dichanthium, and\nChrysopogon and does not form a monophyletic group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae ndhF tree1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3363.phy"}]}
