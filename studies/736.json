Two basic forms of wood decay are known in homobasidiomycetes:\nwhite rot, in which lignin and cellulose are degraded, and brown rot, in\nwhich lignin is not appreciably degraded. An apparent correlation has\nbeen noted between production of a brown rot, decay of conifer\nsubstrates, and possession of a bipolar mating system (which has a\nsingle mating type locus, vs.Â tetrapolar systems, which have two mating\ntype loci). The goals of this study were to infer the historical pattern\nof transformations in decay mode, mating type, and substrate range\ncharacters, and to determine if a causal relationship exists among them.\nWe performed a phylogenetic analysis of 130 species of\nhomobasidiomycetes using nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences, and\nperformed ancestral state reconstructions using parsimony on a range of\ntrees, with various loss:gain cost ratios. We evaluated pairwise\ncharacter correlations using the concentrated changes test (CCT) of\nMaddison and the maximum likelihood (ML) method of Pagel. White rot,\ntetrapolar mating systems, and the ability to decay conifers and\nhardwoods appear to be plesiomorphic in homobasidiomycetes, whereas\nbrown rot, bipolar mating systems, and exclusive decay of conifers\nappear to have evolved repeatedly. The only significant correlation\namong characters was that between brown rot (as the independent\ncharacter) and exclusive decay of conifer substrates. This correlation\nwas supported by the CCT on a range of plausible trees, although not\nwith every reconstruction of ancestral states, and the ML test. Our\nfindings suggest that the evolution of brown rot has promoted repeated\nshifts to specialization for conifer substrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"island3 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3814.phy"},{"tree_label":"island2 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3815.phy"},{"tree_label":"island1 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3816.phy"},{"tree_label":"core tree1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3817.phy"},{"tree_label":"island7 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3810.phy"},{"tree_label":"island5 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3812.phy"},{"tree_label":"island4 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3813.phy"},{"tree_label":"island6 tree1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3811.phy"}]}
