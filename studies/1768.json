The tribe includes more than 115 species, and it has a\ndisjunct distribution with four genera in Central and South America and\none genus in the Mascarene Islands. While the placement of this tribe\nwithin the palm classification has been controversial, the monophyly of\nthe tribe is well supported by plastid DNA sequence data. All the genera\nin Chamaedoreeae are resolved as monophyletic with high support, but the\nrelationships among genera are not fully resolved. The placement of the\ngenus Hyophorbe and the monotypic genus Wendlandiella as sisters to the\nremaining genera gives new insight into the study of the evolution of\nsolitary flowers and the dioecism within this palm tribe. Although a low\nsubstitution rate of palm plastid DNA has been widely mentioned, the\nresults of this study show high resolution at species level, especially\nwithin the largest genus, Chamaedorea, indicating that plastid DNA is\nuseful for the inference of relationships at low taxonomical level in\nsome groups of palms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rps16","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamaedoreeae, rps16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_517.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamaedoreeae, matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2701.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamaedoreeae, ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamaedoreeae, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2702.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnD-trnT","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamaedoreeae, trnDT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2703.phy"}]}
