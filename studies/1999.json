Results from\nphylogenetic analyses place this species within the order\nSphacelariales. Molecular data were supported by two morphological\nfeatures characteristic for the Sphacelariales sensu stricto: the\npresence of apical cells and the transitory blackening of the cell wall\nwith sodium hypochlorite solution (‘Eau de Javel’). However, the\nstrongly heteromorphic life-history distinguishes H. durvillaeae from\nall other members of the Sphacelariales indicating that a comprehensive\nrevision of the order Sphacelariales is required.","trees":[{"tree_label":"not presented","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brown algae rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2982.phy"}]}
