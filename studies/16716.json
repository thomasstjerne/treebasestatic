Although reported from several plant species, little is known\nabout their evolution. Moreover, these genes have not yet been cloned\nfrom the ecological model plant, Nicotiana attenuata, in which the smRNA\nmachinery is known to mediate important ecological traits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"All AGOs NJ","ntax":"302","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree of all AGOs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Plant AGOs NJ","ntax":"270","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of plant AGOs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Plant AGOs ML","ntax":"270","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of plant AGOs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79864.phy"}]}
