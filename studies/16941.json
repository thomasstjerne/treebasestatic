A survey of grape\nvineyards in four provinces of China was carried out to identify the\ncausal agent of Pseudocercospora leaf spot. A phylogenetic analysis\nbased on a combination of LSU, ITS and ACT loci coupled with morphology\nshowed that Pseudocercospora vitis is the sole causal agent causing leaf\nspots. This study represent the first attempt to identify and\ncharacterize the Pseudocercospora species causing Isariopsis leaf spot\nin China using both morphological and molecular approaches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora species causing grapevine Isariopsis\nleaf spot Combined Mp c","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85357.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora species causing grapevine Isariopsis\nleaf spot LSU Mp n1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80965.phy"}]}
