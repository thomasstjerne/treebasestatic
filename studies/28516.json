The novel\ntaxon, Yuxiensis, is distinctly characterised by immersed to erumpent,\nsemi-globose ascomata which are not surrounded by any tomentum or\nconspicuous subiculum, a subcylindrical quellkörper in the centrum,\nclavate asci with long pedicels and allantoid hyaline ascospores with\ngranular contents. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probability\nanalyses based on LSU, ITS, tef1 and rpb2 sequence data depict a close\nrelationship of the new genus to Pseudocatenomycopsis, hence, confirming\nits placement in Scortechiniaceae. Parasympodiellaceae, thus far\nbelonging to Parasympodiellales, is shifted to Coronophorales based on\nphylogenetic evidence. Additionally, the incertae sedis monotypic genus\nArthrocristula, is treated as a synonym of Parasympodiella, with\nArthrocristula hyphenata recombined as Parasympodiella hyphenata\ncomb.nov., as the ex-type strain of Arthrocristula hyphenata clusters\ninside the Parasympodiellaceae clade along with other Parasympodiella\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132079.phy"}]}
