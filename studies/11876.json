The\nposition of Tribulocarpus as sister to the rest of Sesuvioideae is\nconfirmed, and we agree that the genus should be referred to this\nsubfamily. Tetragonia retusa is found to be part of the Tribulocarpus\nclade with strong support, and the new combination Tribulocarpus retusus\nis made. A lectotype is designated for Tetragonia somalensis.\nTribulocarpus dimorphanthus, disjunctly distributed in south-western and\nnorth-eastern Africa, is found to be paraphyletic with regard to T.\nretusus, endemic in Somalia, as the latter is sister to the north-east\nAfrican part of T. dimorphanthus only. Tribulocarpus dimorphanthus-T.\nretusus is proposed as an example of a progenitor-derivative species\npair, where T. retusus has budded off from the north-eastern partial\narea of distribution of T. dimorphanthus. The compound and spiny fruits\nof T. dimorphanthus versus the simple and broadly winged fruits of T.\nretusus, indicate a probably rapid adaptive shift from zoochorous\ntrample burrs to anemochorous nuts","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 8","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 9","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, rps16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d PAUP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, rps16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MajRule 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 7","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48578.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 10","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48590.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced dataset, trnLF region","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48576.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b PAUP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, reduced dataset, rps16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48577.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c PAUP 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, 1 of 60 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MajRule 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d PAUP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, rps16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribulocarpus, MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48594.phy"}]}
