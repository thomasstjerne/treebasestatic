Conflicting reports concerning the host specificity of\nP. syringae pv. lachrymans and lack of molecular analysis has left the\ntrue diversity of populations in the United States unclear. In this\nstudy we collected 27 P. syringae strains over several years from\nwatermelon, cantaloupe, and squash in Florida, Georgia, and California.\nStrains were fluorescent on KingÂ’s medium B agar and displayed the\ntypical phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of P. syringae.\nPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans is a member of genomospecies 2.\nHowever, the genetic profiles obtained through both MLSA (gyrB, rpoD,\ngapA, gltA) and BOX-PCR (BOXA1R) identified 26 of the P. syringae\nstrains to be distributed among three clades within genomospecies 1, and\nphylogenetically distinct from genomospecies 2 member P. syringae pv.\nlachrymans. The identification of a novel multilocus haplotype of the\npathogen common to all states and cucurbit hosts sampled suggests the\npotential dispersion of the pathogen through seed. Considerable genetic\ndiversity among P. syringae strains infecting cucurbits is associated\nwith the same disease, and reflects the larger ecological diversity of\nP. syringae populations from genomospecies 1.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucurbits","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90517.phy"}]}
