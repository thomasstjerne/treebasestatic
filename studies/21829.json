A combination of genomic,\nenzymatic and metabolomic analyses of a deeply-branching\nchemolithotrophic Thermosulfidibacter takaii ABI70S6T revealed an\nunprecedented reversible TCA cycle whose direction was controlled by the\navailable carbon source(s). Under a chemolithoautotrophic condition, a\nrTCA cycle occurred with the reverse reaction of citrate synthase (CS)\nbut not with the ATP-dependent citrate cleavage reactions that had been\nregarded essential for the conventional rTCA cycle. Phylometabolic\nevaluation suggests that the TCA cycle with reversible CS may represent\nan ancestral mode of the (r)TCA cycle and raises the possibilities of a\nchemolithomixotrophic origin of life.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S6","ntax":"223","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrate Synthase MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110448.phy"}]}
