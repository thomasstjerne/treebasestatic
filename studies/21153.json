Although the genus\nCylindrocladiella is a common soil inhabitant in tropical and\nsubtropical countries, only seven species have thus far been reported to\noccur in Thailand. The aim of this study was thus to investigate various\nsoil samples from northern Thailand for the presence of\nCylindrocladiella, and to identify isolates to species level using a\ncombination of cultural studies, morphology and DNA phylogeny (ITS, tef1\nand tub2 gene regions). From the various isolates obtained, six new\nCylindrocladiella species could be identified, described here as C.\nbrevistipitata, C. horticola, C. humicola, C. lateralis, C. reginae, and\nC. terrestris. Further studies are required to establish the ecology of\nthe new species, and also to determine which potential species occur in\nother as yet unsampled regions in Thailand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105253.phy"}]}
