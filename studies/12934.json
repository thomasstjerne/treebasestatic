The status of the group and a revision of characters\npreviously proposed in literature are discussed. The genera Glanidium,\nTatia, and Centromochlus are defined as monophyletic units. Glanidium,\nwith six species, is identified as the sister group of a clade formed by\nthe other two genera. Tatia, known as a paraphyletic assemblage of 17\nspecies by previous authors, is herein restricted to eight species and\nrecognized as the sister group of Centromochlus. Centromochlus,\npreviously consisting of two easily distinguished forms, is expanded to\ninclude nine species. Gelanoglanis is placed as a junior synonym of\nCentromochlus. Based on the given synapomorphies for each group,\ndiagnoses are proposed for Glanidium, Tatia, and Centromochlus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 23+","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Centromochlinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53936.phy"}]}
