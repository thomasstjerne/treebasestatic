Based on the phylogeny inferred from the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), the partial large subunit nuclear ribosomal\nDNA (nrLSU), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) sequences, six well-supported\nclades and 17 phylogenetic species are recognised. Within this\nphylogenetic framework and considering the diagnostic morphological\ncharacters, two new species, C. africanum and C. palaeotropicum, are\ndescribed. In addition, a new infrageneric classification of\nChlorophyllum is proposed, in which the genus is divided into six\nsections. One new combination is also made. This study provides a robust\nbasis for a more detailed investigation of diversity and biogeography of\nChlorophyllum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr109328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109328.phy"}]}
