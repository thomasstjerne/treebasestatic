Jamaica is\nalso important to Croton taxonomy given that several species were first\ndescribed from material from the island. The Jamaican species of Croton\nare found in six different sections indicating that there were at least\nsix separate over-water dispersal events of the genus to the island.\nCroton favocalcaris (section Eluteria), a new species endemic to\nlimestone hills along the southern coast of Jamaica is described and\nillustrated. The species is phylogenetically most closely related to C.\nlaurinus Sw. and C. grisebachianus MÃ¼ll.Arg. \u001aboth also endemic to\nJamaica. Several lectotypifications and novel synonymies are required to\nclarify the taxonomy of the species that have been described from\nJamaica, some of which are widespread in the region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Croton","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5290.phy"}]}
