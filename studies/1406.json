This extraordinary symbiosis is the most extreme\nexample of specialization in a plant-pollinator interaction and has\nfuelled much speculation about co-divergence. The hypothesis that\npollinator specialization led to the parallel diversification of fig and\npollinator lineages (co-divergence) has so far not been tested due to\nthe lack of robust and comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses for both\npartners. We produced and combined the most comprehensive molecular\nphylogenies to date with fossil data to generate independent age\nestimates for fig and pollinator lineages, using both nonparametric rate\nsmoothing and penalized likelihood dating methods. Identifying ten pairs\nof congruent clades, we thereby provide the first and unparalleled\nexample of plant-insect co-divergence over geological times, and for at\nleast the past 60 million years.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2232.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2233.phy"}]}
