The present study places\nP. accuratum in the family Gloeophyllaceae that belongs to the order\nGloeophyllales within Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota), based on evidence\nderived from morphological and ecological characteristics, and\nphylogenetic analyses of sequences of nuclear rDNA regions (5.8S, nuc\n18S, nuc 28S) and protein-coding genes (rpb1, rpb2, and tef1). The\nanalyses presented in this study also give strong support for including\nJaapia in Gloeophyllaceae and Gloeophyllales. Thus, the names Jaapiaceae\nand Jaapiales are considered here as synonyms of Gloeophyllaceae and\nGloeophyllales. Since Paratrichaptum represents the earliest diverging\nlineage in Gloeophyllales, pileate basidiocarps and brown rot appear to\nbe ancestral states of Gloeophyllales. Paratrichaptum accuratum may\nrepresent a relic species, according to its phylogenetic position,\npeculiar distribution pattern and rare occurrence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paratrichaptum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120130.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paratrichaptum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120131.phy"}]}
