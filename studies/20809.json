Agropyron mongolicum is a perennial grass, and\nlittle is known about the mechanism of throughing winter in gramineae.\nHere we report a comprehensive transcriptomics study to capture the\nglobal gene profiles during winter survival of Agropyron mongolicum. We\nexamined the genome-wide gene expression between four stages including\nnormal growth period, before winter(half leaf withering),in the winter\nand after reviving and identified 28 co-expression module with\ndistinctive patterns. Further, we identified the differential expressed\ngenes(GEGs) during development and characterized the functional\nproperties of DEGs by Gene blast to public database of NT,NR,COG,KEGG\netc, 79.6% unigenes being characterized. In addion, we identified the\namount of variation in the expression of the 5 ABA receptor genes.\nFurther analysis of the transcription factors and co-expression module\nM20, found that ABA regulate downstream gene expression by activating\nbZIP, NAC transcription factors to improve cold resistance and winter\nsurvival. This lays a foundation for learning more about the perennial\ngramineous plants overwintering mechanisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ABA receptor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106949.phy"}]}
