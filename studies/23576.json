The aim of the present study was to\ncontribute nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences\nof selected species of Cambodian Cyperaceae to the overall phylogeny of\nthe family. We generated ITS sequences of 38 accessions representing 26\nspecies from Cambodia and used these sequences for phylogenetic analysis\ntogether with similar sequences from the National Center for\nBiotechnology Information GenBank. Our results corroborate recent\nphylogenetic work in the family and largely confirm established tribal\nrelationships. The backbone of the phylogenetic tree of species-rich\ngenera that have undergone rapid radiations is often weakly resolved\n(e.g.Â in Fimbristylis and in the C4 clade of Cyperus). Cryptic variation\nwas revealed in the taxonomically difficult group of Fimbristylis\ndichotoma, with samples of this taxon appearing in two distinct clades\nwithin Fimbristylis. Further addition of geographically spread\naccessions of taxa will improve our understanding of the complex\nbiogeographical history of the genera in the family. Eleocharis koyamae\nTremetsb. & D.A.Simpson is proposed as a new name for E. macrorrhiza\nT.Koyama.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 1 and 2","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyperaceae using ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114938.phy"}]}
