Based on multiple loci\nDNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS),\nthe large subunit (nLSU) and the small subunit (nSSU) of nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene, the small subunit of mitochondrial rRNA gene\n(mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene (TEF1), the largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and the second subunit of RNA\npolymerase II (RPB2), our phylogeny recognizes ten distinct clades of\nPostia sensu lato. Four new genera, Amaropostia, Calcipostia,\nCystidiopostia and Fuscopostia, are established, nine new species,\nAmaropostia hainanensis, Cyanosporus fusiformis, C. microporus, C.\nmongolicus, C. piceicola, C. subhirsutus, C. tricolor, C. ungulatus and\nPostia sublowei, are identified. Illustrated descriptions of the new\ngenera and species are presenteded. Identification keys to Postia and\nits related genera, as well as keys to the species of each genus are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106119","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106119.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106118","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106118.phy"}]}
