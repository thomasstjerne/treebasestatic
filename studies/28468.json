There are many genera\nwithout molecular data and the exact taxonomic placement of those genera\nis undetermined. In this study, we introduce Brunneofissuraceae fam.\nnov. and Cirsosia mangiferae sp. nov. and Asterina neomangiferae nom.\nnov. based on morpho-molecular evidences. All fungal specimens were\ncollected during September from Chiang Mai, Thailand. The phylogenetic\nanalysis based on 28s (LSU) and 5.8s (ITS) sequence data confirmed the\nplacements of Asterolibertia, Brunneofissura and Cirsosia in\nAsterinales. These are the first molecular records for Asterolibertia\n(current name is Asterina) and Cirsosia. Comparative morphologies and\nphylogenetic analyses are provided for each taxon using illustrations\nand well-supported phylogenetic analysis","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brunneofissuraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135689.phy"}]}
