Nevertheless, our understanding\nof the evolution and diversity of insect defenses remains limited, since\nmost studies have focused on visual signaling of defenses against birds,\nthereby implicitly underestimating the impact of insectivorous insects.\nIn the larvae of sawflies in the family Tenthredinidae (Hymenoptera),\nwhich feed on various plants and show diverse lifestyles, two distinct\ndefensive strategies are found: easy bleeding of deterrent hemolymph,\nand emission of volatiles by ventral glands. Here, we used phylogenetic\ninformation to identify phylogenetic correlations among various\necological and defensive traits to estimate the relative importance of\navian versus invertebrate predation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BEAST Dataset1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65657.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Dataset2","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65658.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes Dataset1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65659.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes Dataset2","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65660.phy"}]}
