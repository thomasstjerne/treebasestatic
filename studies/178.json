The accessions were chosen\nto represent the geographic as well as taxonomic range of the genus.\nUsing 12 restriction enzymes a total of 348 sites were detected.\nTwenty-nine mutation sites were phylogenetically informative and used in\na cladistic analysis. Further, a 0.1 kb insertion separated Secale from\nthe outgroup species. Only the annual species S. sylvestre was distinct\nfrom the rest of the taxa. Cultivated rye together with both wild annual\nand wild perennial accessions were mixed among each other. Sequence\ndivergence (p) among taxa of Secale was low, varying from 0.000 to\n0.005, suggesting a rather recent origin of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Secale","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4243.phy"}]}
