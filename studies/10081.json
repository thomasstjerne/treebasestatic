Classically\namphibamids and branchiosaurids have been considered to represent\ndistinct, but closely related clades within dissorophoids, but despite\ntheir importance for the controversial lissamphibian origins, a\ncomprehensive phylogenetic analysis of small dissorophoids has thus far\nnot been attempted. On the basis of an integrated dataset, the\nrelationships of amphibamids and branchiosaurids were analyzed using\nparsimony and Bayesian approaches. Both groups represent miniaturized\nforms and it was tested whether similar developmental pathways,\nassociated with miniaturization, lead to an artificial close\nrelationship of branchiosaurids and amphibamids. Moreover, the fit of\nthe resulting tree topologies to the distribution of fossil taxa in the\nstratigraphic rock record was assessed as an additional source of\ninformation. The results show that characters associated with a\nminiaturized morphology are not responsible for the close clustering of\nbranchiosaurids and amphibamids. Instead, all analyses invariably\ndemonstrate a monophyletic clade of branchiosaurids highly nested within\nderived amphibamids, indicating that branchiosaurids represent a group\nof secondarily neotenic amphibamid dissorophoids. This understanding of\nthe phylogenetic relationships of small dissorophoid amphibians provides\na new framework for the discussion of their evolutionary history and the\nevolution of characters shared by branchiosaurids and/or amphibamids\nwith modern amphibian taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Parsimony complete dataset\nunordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6109.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Parsimony reduced dataset\nordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Bayesian complete dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6193.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Parsimony reduced dataset\nunordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6017.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Parsimony complete dataset\nordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6050.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dissorophoid Amphibians, Bayesian reduced dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6662.phy"}]}
