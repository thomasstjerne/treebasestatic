In Japan,\ndacrymycetous fungi had not been investigated for a long time,\njustifying a taxonomic re-examination. In the present study we attempted\nan investigation of the dacrymycetous fungal flora of Japan, and\nrecognised 28 taxonomic entities, including five new taxa,\ni.e.Â Dacrymyces ancyleus, D. aureosporus, D. pinacea, D. subarcticus and\nDacryopinax sphenocarpa, and nine new records. Due to the present\nsurvey, the total number of dacrymycetous species recorded from Japan\nincreased from 29 to 43. Of the newly described species, Dacrymyces\nancyleus is characterised by recurved, cylindrical basidiocarps and\nhyphae with clamp connections. Dacrymyces aureosporus resembles D.\nchrysospermus, but differs in wall thickness of its marginal hyphae.\nDacrymyces pinacea and D. subarcticus represent new coelomycetous\nanamorphic species. Dacryopinax sphenocarpa has sharp, spathulate\nbasidiocarps, and hyphae with clamp connections. Descriptions,\nillustrations and photographs of fruit bodies are presented with some\ntaxonomic notes. Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted to\nverify the species identification, and the remaining problems in\nDacrymycetes taxonomy are discussed based on these data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6462.phy"}]}
