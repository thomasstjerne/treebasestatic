C4 photosynthesis\nhas been one of the most studied processes in plants with respect to\nfunction, structure, occurrence and response to climatic conditions. One\nof the most promising areas of research of C4 photosynthesis is in the\nCleomaceae, where C4 photosynthesis has been derived at least once. Here\nwe reconstruct the phylogenetic origins of the C4 pathway in the\nCleomaceae using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian\ninference approaches. As has been found previously, commonly recognized\ngenera including Buhsia, Cleomella, Dactylaena, Gynandropsis, Isomeris,\nOxystylis, Podandrogyne, Polanisia, and Wizlizenia which are derived\nfrom within a paraphyletic Cleome. The phylogenetic results presented\nhere suggest that there are likely at least five separate origins of\ncarbon concentrating mechanisms in the Cleomaceae, including at least\nthree separate origins of C4 species. Analyses of historical\nbiogeography suggest Cleomaceae originated in central Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleome ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7226.phy"}]}
