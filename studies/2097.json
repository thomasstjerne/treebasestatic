The results suggest\nthat frogs from the Sierra El Aquaje (Rana sp. Aguaje) belong to the R.\nberlandieri subgroup, or Scurrilirana clade, of the R. pipiens group,\nand are most closely related to a lineage of leopards frogs from\nNayarit, Mexico identified as R. magnaocularis. We also have provided\nfurther evidence that R. magnaocularis and R. yavapaiensis are close\nrelatives, as previously suggested from both morphological, allozyme and\nmtDNA analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rana pipiens complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5212.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rana pipiens complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5210.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rana pipiens complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5211.phy"}]}
