The new species is individualized\nby an annual growth habit, resupinate basidiocarps with snow white to\ncream pore surface, context white to cream when fresh, up to 1.4 cm\nthick, tissue turns into dark brown color in 5% potassium hydroxide\n(KOH); cystidioles are fusoid; dimitic hyphal system, with dextrinoid\nand cyanophilous skeleto-binding hyphae; basidiospores (3.1â4.4 Ã\n2.7â3.6 Âµm) hyaline, thick-walled, IKIâ, and weakly cyanophilous. Both\nmorphological and molecular documentation confirmed that this new\nspecies belongs to the genus Perenniporia and closely related to other\nspecies of this genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91648.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91663.phy"}]}
