The taxonomy and systematics of many plant lineages\nhas been challenging due to a continuous intra and interspecific\nmorphological variation. To assess which evolutionary hypothesis could\nexplain the morphological diversity in the genus Geonoma (Arecaceae), we\nperformed a Mantel test between phylogenetic and morphological distances\nof 54 taxa, and tested for phylogenetic signal using Blombergs\nK-statistic. To obtain a phylogenetic (patristic) distance matrix for\nGeonoma, we constructed a molecular phylogeny of tribe Geonomateae using\nthree nuclear DNA regions. A positive relationship between the patristic\nand a 26-discrete-character distance matrix (R2=0.55, p<0.001)\nsupported the phylogenetic signal hypothesis. The signal was rendered by\nonly four characters: fruit operculum, staminodial tube, connective\nshape and anthers shape. No relationship was evident using a\n17-quantitative-variable distance matrix (R2=0.07, p=0.13), supporting\nthe random drift hypothesis, and all 17 K-values were close to 0,\nsuggesting less phylogenetic signal than under the Brownian model. If\nmost morphological variables traditionally used to classify Geonoma\nevolved randomly, their low selective value might explain Geonomas\nchallenging taxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RPB2 strict consensus","ntax":"181","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48882.phy"},{"tree_label":"3gene bayesian maj rule consensus+","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48880.phy"},{"tree_label":"3gene bayesian maj rule consensus+","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48881.phy"},{"tree_label":"ORSC2 bayesian maj rule cons","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48884.phy"},{"tree_label":"OSRC2 strict consensus","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48883.phy"},{"tree_label":"ORSC2 bayesian maj rule cons","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48885.phy"},{"tree_label":"PRK strict consensus","ntax":"159","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48878.phy"},{"tree_label":"3gene parsimony strict consensus+","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geonoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48879.phy"}]}
