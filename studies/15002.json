The symptoms comprised a general decline of the\ntrees beginning with foliar browning and leaf drop, wilting of apical\nshoots, die-back of twigs and branches, and brown streaking under the\nbark of the trunk, branches and twigs. In more advanced stages of the\ndisease necroses and cankers were observed on the bark. The symptoms\nwere similar to those caused by Verticillium wilt, but morphological and\nmolecular analyses revealed the presence of Pleurostomophora\nrichardsiae, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum and various genera and species\nin the Botryosphaeriaceae. Pathogenicity tests carried out on young\nshoots showed that Pl. richardsiae, Pm. aleophilum and Neofusicoccum\nparvum were pathogenic and capable of causing brown wood streaking.\nSince Pl. richardsiae was the most aggressive of these three fungi and\nfrequently it was the only one isolated from diseased trees it was\nconsidered to be a primary cause of the decline. To our knowledge, this\nis the first report of Pl. richardsiae as a pathogen of olive\ntrees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurostomophora richardsiae, N. parvum and P.\naleophilum on Italian Olives","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72542.phy"}]}
