This\ngenus is broadly distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, i.e.,\nEurope, North America, and Asia (China). However, this genus had not\nbeen found in Japan. In September 2013, an unidentified truffle-like\nfungus was collected in a subalpine forest in Gunma Prefecture, Japan.\nMorphological observations and molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed\nthat this fungus belongs to the genus Balsamia. Here, we describe the\nnew species B. oblonga. This species is characterized by large, oblong\nascospores (up to 33.5 Âµm) with a large lengthto-width ratio (up to\n3.3). Phylogenetic analyses resolved this species as a distinct\nspecies-level branch.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helvellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133802.phy"}]}
