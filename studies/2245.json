It is morphologically distinct from other species of\nStrobilomyces by having a verruculose pileus with small subpyramidal\nscales, a long and thick stipe with small warty to appressed scales,\nsubdecurrent tubes and incompletely reticulate basidiospores. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 3\n(cox3) gene support that it belongs to the genus Strobilomyces and is\nhighly differentiated from the other members of this genus found in\nJapan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strobilomyces verruculosus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5881.phy"}]}
