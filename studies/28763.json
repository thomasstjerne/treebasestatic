Phylogenetic analyses of\nDNA sequences, along with morphological data characters and its\ndistribution pattern, support the new genus and place it as a putative\nsister to Leucocoryne, which is readily distinguished from Atacamallium\nby its floral morphology. Atacamallium minutiflorum can be distinguished\nfrom other species of Leucocoryneae by its overall smaller flowers,\ntepals fused only at the base, six stamens in a single series, and\ntrifid stigma. A morphological description, a distribution map, an\nillustration, and the assessment of the conservation status of the new\nspecies, besides an updated key to the genera of Leucocoryneae, are\nprovided. Additional data from multiple single- copy nuclear genes are\nneeded to clarify the relationships within the tribe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpdna","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134239","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134239.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134238","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134238.phy"}]}
