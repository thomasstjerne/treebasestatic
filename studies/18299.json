It is\ncharacterized and different from other Phialemoniopsis species by its\ncylindrical to flask-shaped conidiophore, falcate conidia with blunt\nends, ostiolate pycnidium-like conidiomata without marginal setae and\nellipsoidal chlamydospores. A multi-locus (ITS, LSU, ACT, and TUB)\nphylogenetic tree supported its independence from other species. A\nsynopsis of the morphological characters of the new species and its\nrelated taxa is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialemoniopsis endophyticus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98800.phy"}]}
