The transfer of this fungus in culture initiated new\npossibilities for investigations, namely cultural morphology, LSU and\nITS molecular phylogenies, life cycle karyology, and mating experiments.\nThe obtained data revealed for this species a generic identity to\nRogersiomyces, supported by results of a morphological analysis. The new\ncombination Rogersiomyces malaysianus is proposed. Molecular studies\nrevealed close relationships of Rogersiomyces, Sistotrema s. lat.\n(including Gloeocystidium sernanderi) and Hydnum s. str.\n(Cantharellales, Agaricomycetes). It was revealed that a nuclear\ndivision into basidium in R. malaysianus is carried out on\nstichobasidiate manner, whereas reproductive behavior of the fungus was\ntested as amphithallic. Morphological features and life cycle of this\nunusual sistotremoid fungus are discussed. It was concluded that\nmicrocyclic reproductive strategy of this fungus, its ephemerous\nfructifications and statismosporic basidia of low recombinative\npotential represent an adaptation to irregular, but plentiful moistening\nwithin monsoonal climates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rogersiomyces malaysianus (Cantharellales,\nAgaricomycetes) ssu phylip phyml","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94090.phy"}]}
