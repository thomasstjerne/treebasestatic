It produces large ovoid muriform solitary\nthallic conidia which are dark brown to black, but encased in a layer of\nsubhyaline peripheral cells. The conidia are produced singly at an\noblique angle to the conidiophores which are borne from superficial\nhyphae on the natural substratum. The genus is compared with other\nsimilar dictyosporous hyphomycetes. Conidia of this fungus germinated\nreadily in culture. Colony morphology is described and its phylogenetic\nrelationship is inferred by comparing the ITS region of the rDNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101082.phy"}]}
