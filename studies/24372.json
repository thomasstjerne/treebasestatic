This study introduces\nIodosphaeria honghense based on morphological characteristics and\nphylogenetic analyses. Iodosphaeria honghensis has cylindrical to\nallantoid, non-mucilaginous and guttulate ascospores which are\ndistinguished from other similar taxa. Multigene phylogenies based on\nLSU, ITS and RPB2 sequence data generated from maximum likelihood and\nMrBayes analyses indicate that I. honghensis forms a distinct lineage\nwithin Iodosphaeriaceae. This study provides its detailed illustration\nwith a morphological comparison of accepted Iodosphaeria species using a\nkey.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117213","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117213.phy"}]}
