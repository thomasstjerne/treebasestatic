In recent years, several reports appeared with viral agents\nas a cause for neu-rologic signs in weanling and growing pigs among\nwhich PTV and new strains of PTV were described. Case presentation On\ntwo unrelated pig farms in the Netherlands the weanling pig population\nshowed a stagger-ing gate, which developed progressively to paresis or\nparalysis of the hind legs with a morbid-ity up to 5%. After necropsy we\ndiagnosed a non-suppurative encephalomyelitis on both farms, which was\nmost consistent with a viral infection. PTV was detected within the\ncentral nervous system by qPCR. From both farms PTV full-length genomes\nwere sequenced, which clustered closely with PTV-3 (98%) or PTV-11\n(85%). Other common swine viruses were excluded by qPCR and sequencing\nof the virus. Conclusion Our results show that new neuroinvasive PTV\nstrains still emerge in pigs in the Netherlands. Further research is\nneeded to investigate the impact of PTV and other viral agents causing\nencephalomyelitis within wild and domestic pig populations supported by\nthe awareness of veterinarians.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Porcine teschovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121736.phy"}]}
