Our analyses showed that all these\nspecimens have an identical rDNA sequences and similar morphological\ncharacteristics. They form a distinct clade separated from other species\nof Erysiphaceae. Pseudoidium acalypha-javanicae differs from Erysiphe\nacalyphae by having shorter conidiophores and foot cells 13 times as\nlong as the 02 other cells. The conidial size of Pseudoidium\nacalypha-javanicae is also smaller than E. jatrophae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55025.phy"}]}
