To clarify species boundaries in the ant genus Hylomyrma FOREL,\n1912 within Central America, we take an integrative approach to\ntaxonomy, combining data from thousands of nuclear loci (Ultra-Conserved\nElements), the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase I, and\nmorphological traits. We reveal potential cryptic species within named\ntaxa and two morphologically distinct new species: Hylomyrma montana and\nH. plumosa. Hylomyrma montana is the first definitive montane species in\nthe genus, with populations in Costa Rica, Panama, and the Pacific slope\nof Ecuador. We show that the Ecuadorian and Central American populations\nform a single clade and are not the result of convergent, montane\nspecialization. We discuss our findings in relation to both montane\ndiversification and Neotropical biogeography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"partitioned by hcluster","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hylomyrma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103402.phy"},{"tree_label":"partitioned by locus","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hylomyrma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103401.phy"},{"tree_label":"unconstrained","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hylomyrma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103416.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hylomyrma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103417.phy"},{"tree_label":"unpartitioned","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hylomyrma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103400.phy"}]}
