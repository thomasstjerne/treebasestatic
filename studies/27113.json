However,\nfollowing KochÂ’s Postulates, L. australis was confirmed as saprobes but\nnot pathogens and other three species have not been tested. The\npathogenicity of Leptosphaerulina spp. are still questionable. In this\nstudy, we isolated 19 Leptosphaerulina strains from diseased golf\nturfgrasses in China, and they were identified as L. gaeumannii, L.\nsaccharicola and a new species L. macrospora, through multilocus (ITS,\n28S, rpb2 and tub2) phylogenetic analyses and morphological\nobservations. Pathogenicity test revealed that the three\nLeptosphaerulina species identified in this study cannot infect\nlive/healthy turfgrass tissue of Poa pratensis and Agrostis stolonifera,\nbut only produced pseudothecia on the dead leaves of stressed seedlings.\nConsidering the results of pathogenicity tests in this and previous\nstudies, we speculated that most Leptosphaerulina species isolated from\ndiseased turfgrass are not pathogens but saprobes. Applying proper\nmanagement practices to prevent severe turfgrass stress is key measure\nto reduce or eliminate the effects of Leptosphaerulina on golf\nturfgrass.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129488.phy"}]}
