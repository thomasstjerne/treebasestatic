These beetles live in obligate\nsymbioses with fungi in the genus Fusarium. In this study, we identified\nEuwallacea spp. and their fungal associates that have emerged as pests\nof planted Acacia crassicarpa in Riau, Indonesia. Morphological\nidentification and phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome\noxidase c subunit I (COI) gene, confirmed that E. similis and E.\nperbrevis are the most abundant beetles infesting these trees.\nMulti-locus phylogenetic analyses of their fungal associates revealed\ntheir non-specific association with six Fusarium spp. These included F.\nrekanum and five novel members of the Ambrosia Fusarium Clade (AFC).\nThese new speceis are described here as F. akasia, F. awan, F. mekan, F.\nvariasi and F. warna.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123913.phy"}]}
