In the fall of 1998,\nsymptoms of a new disease were observed on bentgrass putting greens in\nthree states. The causal agent was determined to be an undescribed\nspecies of Ophiosphaerella based on morphological characteristics. This\nwas supported by sequence analysis of the complete ITS region of the\nrDNA. A new species, Ophiosphaerella agrostis, is described based on\nthese morphological and molecular analyses. Intraspecific genetic\nvariation was assessed using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism DNA\nfingerprinting of 17 isolates collected from nine different locations. A\n90% similarity was found among the isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2.3","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3525.phy"}]}
