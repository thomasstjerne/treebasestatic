Haustorial synergids, first described\nfrom the Arundineae, are reported for a further 26 species (ten genera)\nof danthonioid grasses, a group for which they appear to be\nsynapomorphic. The evolution of this character and a suite of associated\nintegument and nucellar characters is discussed. The danthonioid clade,\nas defined by haustorial synergids, includes Cortaderia (often treated\nas nondanthonioid) but excludes a number of taxa currently contained in\nthe Arundineae. The full extent of the group remains undetermined,\nhowever, since several of its potential members remain unstudied. The\ndata provide some indication of phylogenetic structure within the clade.\nAt least two of the species of Merxmuellera studied appear to occupy a\nbasal position, while three do not, suggesting that this genus may be\nparaphyletic, or even polyphyletic. Also, the reduction or absence of\nsynergid haustoria in Prionanthium, Pentaschistis, and Pentameris is\nconsidered to be secondarily derived and weakly corroborates the\nmonophyly of this generic cluster as indicated by spikelet\nmorphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4275.phy"}]}
