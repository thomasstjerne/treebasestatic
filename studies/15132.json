In this study we estimated a multilocus\nphylogeny for the North American chorus frog genus Pseudacris using\nanonymous nuclear loci that were recently developed using a reduced\nrepresentation library approach. We sequenced 27 nuclear loci and three\nmitochondrial loci for 44 individuals on 1/3 of an Illumina MiSeq run,\nobtaining 96.5% of the targeted amplicons at less than 20% of the cost\nof traditional Sanger sequencing. We found heterogeneity among gene\ntrees, although four major clades (Trilling Frog, Fat Frog, crucifer,\nand West Coast) were consistently supported, and we resolved the\nrelationships among these clades for the first time with strong support.\nWe also found discordance between the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets\nthat we attribute to mitochondrial introgression and a possible\nselective sweep. Bayesian concordance analysis in BUCKy and species tree\nanalysis in *BEAST produced largely similar topologies, although we\nidentify taxa that require additional investigation in order to clarify\ntaxonomic and geographic range boundaries. Overall, we demonstrate the\nutility of a reduced representation library approach for marker\ndevelopment and parallel tagged sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq for\nphylogenetic studies of non-model organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
