The genus is typified by\nL. albomarginata sp. nov. which is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, resupinate basidiocarps with yellow pores, a monomitic hyphal\nsystem with clamp connections, tramal hyphae with swollen tips which\nprojecting out of hymenium, and hyaline, thin-walled, oblong-ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. Phylogeny of L. albomarginata and its related species was\ninferred from ITS and nLSU rDNA sequences, and the genus belongs to the\nMeruliaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93303.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93304.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93302.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93301.phy"}]}
