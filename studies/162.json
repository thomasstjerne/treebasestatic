Morphological and chromosomal evidence supports separation of\nthe genus into two genera, Spilanthes and Acmella, which can be\ndistinguished by at least eight morphological characters and by\ndistinctive basic chromosome numbers. Studies of other genera within the\nHeliantheae suggest that both Spilanthes and Acmella are allied to\nSalmea in the Verbesininae. Spilanthes is here recognized as comprising\nsix species distributed primarily in sandy soils of South America, the\nWest Indies, northern Australia, Malaysia, and central and western\nAfrica. A phylogenetic reconstruction employing cladistic methods\nsuggests that the New World species, S. leiocarpa, S. nervosa, S.\nparaguayensis, and S. urens, are more closely allied to each other than\nto the Old World species. The cladistic analysis further suggests a\ncloser relationship between the Australo-Malaysian S. anactina and the\nNew World species than with S. costata, a species restricted to central\nand western tropical Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spilanthes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_215.phy"}]}
