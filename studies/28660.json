Twenty-one unidentified Lulworthiales were isolated in previous\nsurveys aimed at broadening our understanding of the biodiversity hosted\nin the Mediterranean Sea. This organisms, mostly found in association\nwith Posidonia oceanica and with submerged woods, were here examined by\nthe mean of thorough multi-locus phylogenetic analyses and morphological\nobservations. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny based on nrITS,\nnrSSU, nrLSU beside 4 pro-tein-coding genes led to the introduction of\nthe novel species Paralulworthia mediterranea and of the new genus\nLulworthiella, which encompass the two novel species Lulworthiella\ncandida and Lulworthiella elbense. Once again, the Mediterranean Sea is\nconfirmed a huge reservoir of novel fungal lineages with an\nunder-investigated biotechnological potential that is only waiting to be\nexploited.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132858.phy"}]}
