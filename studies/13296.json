An extraordinary diversity\nand abundance of fossils was found concentrated in a 0.5 m horizon in\nthe same quarry, including a new titanosaur sauropod, Futalognkosaurus\ndukei n.gen., n.sp, which is the most complete giant dinosaur known so\nfar. Several plant leaves, showing a predominance of angiosperms over\ngymnosperms that likely constituted the diet of F. dukei were found too.\nOther dinosaurs (sauropods, theropods, ornithopods), crocodylomorphs,\npterosaurs, and fishes were also discovered, allowing a partial\nreconstruction of this Gondwanan continental ecosystem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56319.phy"}]}
