This\nspecies lives on dead antipatharian colonies and on artificial\nsubstrates deeper than 60 m down to 140 m and is thus considered to be a\nlower mesophotic octocoral. It has no sclerites and features no\nsymbiotic zooxanthellae. The new genus is compared to other known\nsclerite-free octocorals. Molecular phylogenetic analyses place it in a\nclade with members of families Clavulariidae and Acanthoaxiidae, and for\nnow we assign it to the former based on colony morphology The\npolyphyletic family Clavulariidae is, however, in need of a thorough\nrevision once the morphological distinctions among its phylogenetically\ndistinct clades are better understood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesophotic Octocorals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107195.phy"}]}
