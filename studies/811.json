Histological\nstudies indicated that the culture isolate is able to colonize stems and\nleaves with no damage to the host plant. In vitro-grown peppermint\nplants displayed enhanced vegetative growth when infected by the fungus,\nwith mycelium extending from green tissues to growing rootlets. The\nproduction of very thin hyphae growing away from host meristems and the\nasymptomatic nature of the symbiosis were commonly observed in cultures,\nwhere the isolate never sporulated. No attribution to a precise\nmorphospecies was therefore possible and the fungal culture was named\nsterile mycelium PGP-HSF. Through comparison of the 18 S rDNA sequence\nof the epibiont to those available in literature and in GenBank we were\nable to determine that the mutualist of peppermint is a member of the\nPyrenomycetes, belonging to the subclass Sordariomycetidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1183.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1182.phy"}]}
