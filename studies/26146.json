One of\nthe new species proposed here, corresponds to a choice edible mushroom,\nit in our molecular phylogeny resulted to be related with the group of\nspecies around C. lateritius and sister with Craterellus confluens type\nspecimen. This latter is here formally transferred to Cantharellus and\nconsequently a new name is proposed to replace the homonym Cantharellus\nconfluens (Schwein.)

Detailed macroscopic and microscopic descriptions accompanied\nwith illustrations and a taxonomic discussion are presented for each\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134427","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134427.phy"}]}
