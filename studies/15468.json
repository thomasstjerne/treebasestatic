However, the\npatterns and mechanisms of modern distribution of mangroves are still\nnot well understood. Historical vicariance and dispersal are two\nhypothetic biogeographic processes in shaping the patterns of\npresent-day species distributions. Here we investigate evolutionary\nbiogeography of mangroves in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP) and western\nAtlantic-East Pacific (AEP) regions using a large sample of populations\nof Rhizophora (the most representative mangrove genus) and a combination\nof chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences and genome-wide ISSR\nmarkers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizophora-bayes phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70981.phy"}]}
