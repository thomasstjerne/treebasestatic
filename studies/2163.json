In this\nstudy we evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the M. anisopliae\ncomplex, identify monophyletic lineages and clarify the species\ntaxonomy. To this end, we have employed a multigene phylogenetic\napproach utilizing near-complete sequences from nuclear encoded EF-1?,\nRPB1, RPB2, and ?-tubulin gene regions and evaluated the morphology of\nthese taxa, including ex-types whenever possible. The phylogenetic\nevidence supports the monophyly of these varieties. We propose that they\nbe elevated to species level as: M. acridum stat. nov., M. lepidiotae\nstat. nov., and M. majus stat. nov. In addition, we resurrect the name\nM. brunneum as a sister group to M. anisopliae and show that M. taii is\na later synonym of M. guizhouense.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 21","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metarhizium anisopliae, Multigene Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5319.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 22","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metarhizium anisopliae, EF-1 alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5320.phy"},{"tree_label":"IGS","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metarhizium anisoplia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5321.phy"}]}
