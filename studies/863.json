Altogether, 18 specimens were sequenced and their spore\nsizes plotted together with measurements from the corresponding type\nspecimens. Spore sizes were found to cluster readily into four groups,\nall of which were supported by the phylogenetic analysis. However, in\nthe case of H. punctulatum and H. albostramineum, the morphological\ndelimitation is unsatisfactory and a zone of potential spore size\noverlap is shown to exist. The new combination Hypochnicium cremicolor\nis proposed for a species previously known as a small-spored taxon in\nthe H. punctulatum complex, and H. caucasicum is shown to be a younger\nsynonym to H. wakefieldiae. A key to the species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochnicium punctulatum complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_612.phy"}]}
