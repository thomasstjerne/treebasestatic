Phylogenies on species of the genus are reconstructed with multiple\nloci DNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS), the large subunit (nLSU) and the small subunit (nSSU) of nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene\n(TEF1). The results demonstrate the polyphyly of Spongipellis, including\ntwo different genera belong to different families, Pseudospongipellis is\nas a new genus established including three new combinations. Three new\nspecies Irpiciporus sinuosus, Radulodon yunnanensis and Spongipellis\nquercicola spp. nov. are described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136053","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136053.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136054","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136054.phy"}]}
