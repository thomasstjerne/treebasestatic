Yet for\ndisjunct distributions involving North America and the Old World, Africa\nis rarely considered. We present a molecular biogeographic study in the\nlegume family that suggests a vicariant biogeographical relationship\nbetween Africa and North America. Such a relationship is likely to be\nshown with additional phylogenetic analysis to be prevalent among legume\ngroups and other taxa that diversified during the Tertiary in seasonally\ndry tropical vegetation. If so, this finding would strengthen the\nhypothesis that the Tertiary North Atlantic land bridge had a\nsignificant influence on the Cenozoic formation of continental biotas,\nincluding that of Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dalbergioid legumes ITS/5.8S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dalbergioid legumes matK/trnK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5704.phy"}]}
