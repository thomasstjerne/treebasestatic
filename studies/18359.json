Potamogeton hybrids\nseldom exhibit obvious morphological characteristics that make accurate\nidentification of hybrids and non-hybrids difficult. Genetic data\ntherefore have been used effectively to detect and document hybrids of\nPotamogeton. Here we apply a molecular phylogenetic approach to\npreliminary investigate hybridization of Potamogeton in Argentina.\nSimultaneously performed molecular phylogenetic analyses based on a\ncombined plastid DNA (atpB-rbcL, psbA-trnH, trnK 5â intron, trnL intron,\ntrnL-trnF, and rpl20-rps12) and two nuclear DNA (ITS and 5S-NTS) data\nsets showed significant topological incongruences regarding the\npositions of a single specimen, which was placed with broad-leaved\npolyploid species and linear-leaved diploid relatives in plastid and\nnuclear phylogenies, respectively. This discrepancy may indicate\ninter-ploidy hybridization. This hybridization occurs most probably\nbetween diploid P. berteroanus and octaploid P. illinoensis; the former\nand the latter are paternal and maternal donors, respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91031","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91031.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91032","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91032.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr91033","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91033.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91034.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91035.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"212","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr91028","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91028.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"252","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91029","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91029.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr91030","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91030.phy"}]}
