The asexual state formed in culture and\nmorphological and molecular data support the inclusion in the genus. A\nphylogeny generated with maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches\nplaced the fungus in a well-supported clade with other Conioscypha and\nConioscyphascus species. Nomenclature used herein reflects changes made\nin the Melbourne Code, with Conioscyphascus being considered a later\nsynonym of Conioscypha. The fungus is described, illustrated and\ncompared to morphologically similar taxa. In addition, Conioscypha\ngracilis, is reported from both lentic and lotic habitats in Perú.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conioscypha peruensis MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70161.phy"}]}
