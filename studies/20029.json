It clearly\ndiffers from previously reported Armillaria species in North, Central,\nand South America. It is characterized by the absence of fibulae in the\nbasidioma, abundant cheilocystidia, and ellipsoidal, hyaline\nbasidiospores that are apparently smooth with light microscopy, but\nslightly to moderately rugulose with scanning electron microscopy. It is\ndifferentiated from other Armillaria species by macro-morphological\ncharacters, including annulus structure, pileus and stipe coloration,\nand other structures. DNA-sequence data [nuc rDNA internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS), 28S D-domain, 3′ end of 28S-Intergenic\nspacer 1, and translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1)] show that A.\nmexicana sequences are quite distinct from sequences of analogous\nArmillaria species in GenBank. In addition, sequences of ITS of the A.\nmexicana ex-type culture reveal an ITS1 of 1,299 bp and ITS2 of 582 bp,\nthe longest ITS regions reported thus far in fungi. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on TEF1sequences place A. mexicana in a well-separated,\nmonophyletic clade basal to the polyphyletic A. mellea complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98935.phy"}]}
