Secotioid and gasteroid forms occur in four independent clades\nnested within agaricoid forms. One clade corresponds to the secotioid T.\npulchella, from Southern Europe and North Africa. The others correspond\nto Torrendia and Amarrendia species from Australia. Mediterranean-type\nclimatic conditions are postulated as a force driving the convergent\nevolution of these secotioid and at least one of the gasteroid forms in\ngeographically distant areas. Species formerly placed in Torrendia and\nAmarrendia are transfered to Amanita. A new species of Torrendia from\nAustralia was discovered during the revision of the collections\noriginally identified as T. arenaria, and is here described as Amanita\npseudoinculta.\n","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Subgenus Amanita","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6697.phy"},{"tree_label":"nLSU","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6069.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Subgenus Lepidella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6407.phy"}]}
