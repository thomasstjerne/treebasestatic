Using a wide range of rust species with different life cycles\nand with different host specificities, Puccinia and Uromyces were shown\nto be highly polyphyletic and to also include representatives of the\ngenera Aecidium, Cumminsiella, Dietelia, Endophyllum, Miyagia, and\nUredo. Furthermore, the structure of the phylogenetic data did not\nreflect previous sub-generic delimitations based on teliospore pedicel\nstructure, but rather suggests that at least two major lineages have\nevolved within Puccinia/Uromyces: Rusts with telial states on Poaceae\nwere exclusively found in one of these groupings and those with telial\nstates on Cyperaceae resided in the other lineage. This might suggest\nthat the two lineages evolved in close association with these host\ngroups in different biomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ Tree","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyphyly in the rust fungal mega-genera Puccinia and\nUromyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2593.phy"}]}
