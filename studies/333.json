Gnetales\nand Angiosperms are supported as sister groups of the Anaspermae. A\nsister-group relationship between Coniferales and Ginkgoales represents\na paraphyletic group, because Coniferales and Anaspermae share a common\nancestry (Mesospermae). Ginkgoales and Mesospermae are sister groups of\nthe Cladospermae. Cycadales are supported as the most archaic\nSpermatophyta. A posteriori consideration of fossil taxa supports the\nconclusion that data from the fossil record are useful for confirming\nplesiomorphies of extant taxa. Fossil taxa with apomorphic character\nstates are discussed as biasing for superficial accelerated\ntransformations, which are probably unacceptable from teh standpoint of\nmorphological homology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spermatophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1513.phy"}]}
