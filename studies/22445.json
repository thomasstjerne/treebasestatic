During studies of hypogeous sequestrate fungi in Rio\nGrande do Sul State, South of Brazil, an unexpected new species of\nLactarius was finding in soils of exotic Pinus plantation and here\ndetermined based on morphological and nrITS. It is characterized by the\nhypogeous basidiomes, reddish yellow to dark brown with a persistent\nperidium and white milky latex. Microscopically is characterized by the\nglobose, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores, ornamentation\nforming a complete and densely reticulum and the peridiopellis forming a\ncutis of repent firmly woven hyphae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110569.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110714","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110714.phy"}]}
