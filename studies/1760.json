In allopolyploids, genome duplication is\nassociated with hybridization between two or more divergent genomes.\nSuccessive hybridization and polyploidzation events can build up species\ncomplexes of allopolyploids with complicated network-like histories, and\nthe evolutionary history of many plant groups cannot be adequately\nrepresented by phylogenetic trees because of such reticulate events. The\nhistory of complex genome mergings within a high-polyploid species\ncomplex in the genus Cerastium (Caryophyllaceae) is here untangled by\nthe use of a network algorithm and non-coding sequences of a low-copy\nnumber gene. The resulting network illustrates how hybridization and\npolyploidization have acted as key evolutionary processes in creating a\nplant group where high-level allopolyploids clearly outnumber extant\nparental genomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerastium, RP2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_572.phy"}]}
