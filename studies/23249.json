Here, we infer the phylogenetic position\nof the locally endemic Doronicum cataractarum testing previous\nhypotheses with respect to its biogeographic and temporal origin\n(Tertiary origin with southwest Asian affinities versus possibly\nPleistocene origin in the Alps). To this end, we extended existing\ngenus-wide data sets of nuclear and plastid DNA sequences and obtained\nsequences from two hitherto not used low copy nuclear markers. These\ndata sets were analyzed, as single markers and jointly in a concatenated\nmatrix, using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. Temporal and\nspatial origins of D. cataractarum were inferred using mean path lengths\nand dispersalvicariance analysis, respectively. Phylogenetic resolution\nwas limited, but several geographically coherent groups were identified,\nincluding the Grandiflora group comprising southern and central European\nmountain species. Congruently, D. cataractarum was inferred as most\nclosely related to Alpine species from the Grandiflora group (D. clusii,\nD. stiriacum and D. glaciale), but neither to southwest Asian species\nnor to European D. austriacum. The origin of D. cataractarum was\nconservatively dated to about 1.9 Mya and inferred to have taken place\nin the Alps. The striking morphological differences between D.\ncataractarum and the most closely related species likely are the result\nof adaptation to different habitats or, alternatively, the presence of\nplesiomorphic traits in D. cataractarum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"maximum likelihood","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114922.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum parsimony, strict consensus","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114917.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum likelihood","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114918.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum parsimony, strict consensus","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114927.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum likelihood","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114920.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum parsimony strict consensus","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114919.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum parsimony, strict consensus","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114925.phy"},{"tree_label":"maximum parsimony, strict consensus","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doronicum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114921.phy"}]}
