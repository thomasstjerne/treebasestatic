There are three different races of\nB. braunii, A, B, and L, that are distinguished based on the type of\nhydrocarbon each produces. Each race also has many strains that are\ndistinguished by their location of identification. While B. braunii has\nbeen well studied for the chemistry of the hydrocarbon production, very\nlittle is known about B. braunii from a molecular aspect. To begin to\naddress this problem, we determined the genome size of the A race,\nYamanaka strain, and the L race, Songkla Nakarin strain of B. braunii.\nFlow cytometry analysis indicates that the A race of B. braunii has a\ngenome size of 167.0 +/- 0.4 Mb, while the L race has a significantly\nlarger genome size at 211.3 +/- 1.7 Mb. We also used phylogenetic\nanalysis with the nuclear small subunit (18S) rRNA gene to classify\nstrains of the A and B race that have not yet been evolutionarily\ncompared to previously published B. braunii phylogenetics. The analysis\nsuggests that B. braunii races are evolutionarily related based on the\ntype of liquid hydrocarbon they produce.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryococcus braunii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9381.phy"}]}
