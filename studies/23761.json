Phylogenetically the\nspecies is close to M. carneum, but it is distinguished morphologically\nfrom M. carneum by size and surface structure of conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr115322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115322.phy"}]}
