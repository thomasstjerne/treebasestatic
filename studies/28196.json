The description, photographs, and comparisons with\nmorphologically similar and phylogenetically related species are\nprovided. Conclusions of its phylogenetic relationships with similar\nspecies are also drawn based on the sequence of the nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacer region, as well as the large subunit rRNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134216","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134216.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134217.phy"}]}
