The examined\nmembers of the genus Umbelopsis were resolved into major two clades,\nClade I and II. The intraspecific groups of U. ramanniana constituted\nClade II with U. westeae, U. swartii, U. autotrophica, U. gibberisopra,\nU. angularis, and U. fusiformis. In this major clade, the intraspecific\ngroups of U. ramanniana split into three polyphyletic subclades. This\nfact suggests that Umbelopsis ramanniana @is an assemblage of several species that\ngenetically distinct. Interestingly, in spite of diverse sporangiospore\nshapes of the member of Clade II, genetic variation among them was\nsmall. Their flexible sporangia membranes would make possible to develop\nvarious shapes of the sporangiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis ramanniana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis ramanniana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6084.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis ramanniana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6309.phy"}]}
