{"Authors":" Conrad Lamoraal Schoch, Martin Grube","Year":" 2013","Title":" Pezizomycotina: Dothideomycetes and Arthoniomycetes","Journal":" NA","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":"","Keywords":" Review","DOI":"","Abstract":" The modern concepts of Dothideomycetes and Arthoniomycetes\ncan be traced back to Luttrell (1955) who, relying on data from a number\nof previous publications, combined lichenised and nonlichenised fungi in\na single class, Loculoascomycetes. A current concept of two separate\nclasses, as well defined sister taxa, is still new, but it is closely\ntied to the use of DNA sequence based phylogenies to define fungal taxa.\nDNA sequence comparisons, which have now been in use in mycology since\nthe early 1990s confirmed that important morphological and developmental\ncharacters traditionally used in the taxonomy of loculoascomycetes, are\nhomoplasious. What was earlier referred to as the “bitunicate\nascomycetes” contains multiple diverse lineages, which have now been\nplaced in three different classes within Ascomycota. Eurotiomycetes\ncontain Pyrenulales, Verrucariales and Chaetothyriales within subclass\nChaeothyriomycetidae (Geiser et al. 2006) and the remaining (and\nmajority of) bitunicate species reside within two sister classes,\nArthoniomycetes and Dothideomycetes. This review describes the latest\ntaxonomic classifications substantiated with DNA and protein sequence\ncomparisons and discusses morphology, biology and ecology within this\ncontext","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"400","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dotihdeomyceta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70443.phy"}]}
