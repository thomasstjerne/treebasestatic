We selected\n529 species to address phylogenetic relationships of higher-level taxa\nusing a maximum-likelihood framework and sequence data from six genes\ntraditionally used in fungal molecular systematics (nrLSU, nrSSU, 5.8S,\ntef1-α, rpb1 and rpb2). These species represent 18 classes, 62 orders,\n183 families, and 392 genera from the phyla Basidiomycota (including the\nnewly recognized subphylum Wallemiomycotina) and Entorrhizomycota, and\n13 species representing 13 classes of Ascomycota as outgroup taxa. We\nalso conducted a molecular dating analysis based on these six genes for\n116 species representing 17 classes and 54 orders of Basidiomycota and\nEntorrhizomycota. Finally we performed a phyloproteomics analysis from\n109 Basidiomycota species and 6 outgroup taxa using amino-acid sequences\nretrieved from 396 orthologous genes. Recognition of higher taxa follows\nthe criteria in Zhao et al (Fungal Divers 78:239292, 2016): (i) taxa\nmust be monophyletic and statistically well-supported in molecular\ndating analyses, (ii) their respective stem ages should be roughly\nequivalent, and (iii) stem ages of higher taxa must be older than those\nof lower level taxa. The time-tree indicates that the mean of stem ages\nof Basidiomycota and Entorrhizomycota are ca. 530 Ma; subphyla of\nBasidiomycota are 406490 Ma; most classes are 358393 Ma for those of\nAgaricomycotina and 245356 Ma for those of Pucciniomycotina and\nUstilaginomycotina; most orders of those subphyla split 120290 Ma.\nMonophyly of most higher-level taxa of Basidiomycota are generally\nsupported, especially those taxa introduced in the recent ten years:\nphylum Entorrhizomycota, classes Malasseziomycetes, Moniliellomycetes,\nSpiculogloeomycetes, Tritirachiomycetes and orders Amylocorticiales,\nGolubeviales, Holtermanniales, Jaapiales, Lepidostromatales,\nRobbauerales, Stereopsidales and Trichosporonales. However, the younger\ndivergence times of Leucosporidiales (Microbotryomycetes) indicate that\nits order status is not supported, thus we propose combining it under\nMicrobotryales. On the other hand, the families Buckleyzymaceae and\nSakaguchiaceae (Cystobasidiomycetes) are raised to Buckleyzymales and\nSakaguchiales due to their older divergence times. Cystofilobasidiales\n(Tremellomycetes) has an older divergence time and should be amended to\na higher rank. We however, do not introduce it as new class here for\nCystofilobasidiales, as DNA sequences from these taxa are not from their\nrespective types and thus await further studies. Divergence times for\nExobasidiomycetes, Cantharellales, Gomphales and Hysterangiales were\nobtained based on limited species sequences in molecular dating study.\nMore comprehensive phylogenetic studies on those four taxa are needed in\nthe future because our ML analysis based on wider sampling, shows they\nare not monophyletic groups. In general, the six-gene phylogenies are in\nagreement with the phyloproteomics tree except for the placements of\nWallemiomycotina, orders Amylocorticiales, Auriculariales,\nCantharellales, Geastrales, Sebacinales and Trechisporales from\nAgaricomycetes. These conflicting placements in the six-gene phylogeny\nvs the phyloproteomics tree are discussed. This leads to future\nperspectives for assessing gene orthology and problems in deciphering\ntaxon ranks using divergence times.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"534","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106951.phy"}]}
