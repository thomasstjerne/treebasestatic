Hemiaustroboletus\nis supported by morphological and molecular data using ITS, LSU and RPB2\nregions. The genus is characterized by pileate-stipitate basidiomatas; a\npurple, brown, reddish-brown, orange-brown to dark brown vinaceous\npileus; a whitish or lilac to vinaceous context, and a subclavate stipe.\nMicroscopically, it is characterized by ornamented, slightly verrucose,\ncracked to perforated brown basidiospores. Two species are described\nwithin the genus, Hemiaustroboletus vinaceobrunneus and H. vinaceus.\nAlthough both species are distributed in subtropical forests in Mexico,\nGenBank unidentified voucher DNA sequences and environmental sequences\nshowed that the genus is widely distributed (China, Canada, United\nStates, and Mexico). Hemiaustroboletus vinaceus is morphologically\nsimilar to Austroboletus gracilis and has therefore been confused with\nthis species. This study presents the phylogenetic placement and\ndetailed morphological description and photographs of both species, and\ntheir microscopic structures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131401","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131401.phy"}]}
