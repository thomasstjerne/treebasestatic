Maintenance of gene\nvariation enables populations to adapt more quickly to environmental\nchanges. The geographical gaps also influence the distribution and\nevolutionary history of many mountain frogs in the world. Hence, a sound\nknowledge in population genetic structure of a species will help\nunderstand its population dynamics and develop conservation strategies.\nIn the context of facing threats to the amphibian fauna of Western Ghats\ndue to habitat loss, we used both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers\nto investigate the genetic structure of an endemic frog species of the\nWestern Ghats (Indirana semipalmata) with restricted distribution. The\npresent study showed the importance of mountain gaps in shaping the\nspeciesâ€™ structuring in the Western Ghats. Though a high genetic\ndiversity was observed for the species when considering as a single unit\nin the southern Western Ghats, the restricted gene flow on/between\neither side of the Shencottah gap with genetic clustering of the sampled\npopulations may warrant a unique management plan for the species. The\nhabitat fragmentation of the Western Ghats through anthropogenic\nactivities may result in severe setbacks to the survival of the species\nin the future.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126424","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126424.phy"}]}
