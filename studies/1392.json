The affinities of this taxon extend\nbetween a wide range of unitunicate ascomycetes (viz.Â Annulatascaceae,\nMagaporthaceae, Pleurotremaceae, Trichosphaeriaceae). In order to\nevaluate its familial placement and generic relatedness with other known\nascomycetes, partial DNA sequences derived from the large subunit\nribosomal DNA (28S rDNA) were analyzed. Results from the phylogenetic\nanalyses indicate that the family Annulatascaceae is polyphyletic. The\nunidentified taxon has close affinities with the Annulatascaceae and\nOphiostomataceae but does not belong in any existing genera. Thus a new\ngenus, Fusoidispora aquatica, is established to accommodate it.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Annulatascaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2205.phy"}]}
