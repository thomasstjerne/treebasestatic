Among 15 species collected from Japan, we concluded that the\nsingle phylogenetic cluster consisted of the type species, P. formosus\nand Cordyceps (sensu lato) pleuricapitata, located at a far apart clade\nof the phylogenetic clade constructed by P. ramosus and other species.\nDNA sequences and anamorphic characters from living culture revealed\nthat Ophiocordyceps pentatomae is a teleomorph of Hirsutella nutans and\nalso Polycephalomyces yunnanensis would be the lator synonym.\nSubsequently, a new combination, P. nutans, was proposed for the\ncombined species. Two novel species are proposed as P.\ninconditacapitatus sp. nov. on cicada nymphs and P. sakanei sp. nov. on\nscarab larvae. The phylogenetic position of Ophiocordyceps sessilis\nrevealed that it belonged to Perennicordyceps; thus, the new combination\nPerennicordyceps sessilis was proposed. Similarly, Polycephalomyces\ntomentosus was renounced from the genus Polycephalomyces and reverted to\nthe name Blistum tomentosum, family Clavicipitaceae. Additionally, the\nanamorphic states of C. pleuricapitata and P. nipponicus are reported\nhere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123939","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123939.phy"}]}
