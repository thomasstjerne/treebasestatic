Previous attempts to derive an\nevolutionarily justifiable classification for this group of birds using\nosteological and behavioral data have been hampered by these\nsimilarities. We present a well-resolved evolutionary tree for some 40\ncormorant taxa based on the results of extensive genetic work that\nproduced over 8000 bases of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence. This\ntree implies a novel classification for the cormorants, which reflects\ntheir evolutionary history and can be implemented using some 7 genera.\nSome of the relationships among the species are well-known but many are\npreviously unrecognized. Nevertheless, much of the classification makes\nsense in terms of biogeography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cormorants of the World, mtDNA nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77888.phy"}]}
