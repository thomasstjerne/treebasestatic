(Dipterocarpaceae) and Ehretia\nacuminate (Boraginaceae). Both morphology and multigene analyses\nrevealed two taxa as new species (Hermatomyces turbinatus and H.\njinghaensis) and the remaining collections as new records of\nHermatomyces sphaericus. Hermatomyces turbinatus is characterized by 1)\ndimorphic conidia, having circular to oval lenticular conidia and 2)\nturbinate conidia consisting of two columns with two septa composed of\n23 cells in each column. Hermatomyces jinghaensis is characterized by\ndimorphic conidia, having circular to oval lenticular conidia and\nclavate or subcylindrical cylindrical conidia and consisting of one or\ntwo columns with 68 cells in each column. Phylogenetic analyses of\ncombined LSU, ITS, β-TUB, tef1-α and rpb2 sequence data supports the\nplacement of these new taxa within Hermatomycetaceae with high\nstatistical support","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hermatomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135893.phy"}]}
