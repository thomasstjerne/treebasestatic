The new species is introduced based on the evidence from\nmorphological comparison and analysis of a concatenated LSU, ITS, SSU\nand RPB2 sequence data. Monilochaetes pteridophytophila differs from\nextant Monilochaetes species in having darker and fewer septate\n(1Â–4-septate) conidiophores. Monilochaetes pteridophytophila forms a\ndistinct clade basal from other species of Monilochaetes in\nAustraliascaceae. A detailed description and illustrations of the new\nspecies are provided. We also provided a synopsis of accepted\nMonilochaetes species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129924.phy"}]}
