It is characterized by an annual growth habit,\nresupinate basidiocarps with white rhizomorphs, large pores, narrow and\nstrongly dextrinoid skeletal hyphae, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose,\nthick-walled, finely asperulate and strongly amyloid basidiospores\n(3.8â“4.2 Ã 2.8â“3.2 Âµm), and presence of gloeoplerous hyphae in trama.\nA molecular study based the combined ITS (internal transcribed spacer\nregion) and nLSU (the large nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit) dataset\nsupported the position of the new species in Wrightoporia. A key to\naccepted species of Wrightoporia in China is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia ITS MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79656.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia ITS MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79654.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia ITS MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79655.phy"}]}
