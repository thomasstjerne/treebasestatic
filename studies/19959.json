Pholiota linzhiensis is recognized by its pileus covered with\nradially appressed fibrillose squamules, stipe with subfloccose to\nrecurved scales; yellow and thick-walled pleurocystidia, as well as\noblong and sometimes pyriform spores. The species is described and\nillustrated, and a phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer\nnuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) is presented. Both the morphology and the\nphylogenetic analysis showed that P. linzhiensis belongs to Pholiota\nsubgenus Flammuloides section Lubricae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FIGURE 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis based on ITS sequences showing the\nplacement of the new species P. linzhiensis within Pholiota subgenus\nFlammuloides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98786.phy"}]}
