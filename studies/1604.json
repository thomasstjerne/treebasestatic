Conidiostromata\non A. ciliare var. minus enclosed and sterilized young inflorescens,\nsuch as the typical choke symptom by Epichloë typhina. On the other\nhand, conidiostromata on A. tsukusiense var. transiens thinly covered\nmature spike with white epiphyllous hyphae, such as a conidiostroma of\nEphelis spp. The fungal isolates produced typical Neotyphodium-type\nconidia. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using the beta-tubulin gene\n(tubB) indicated that the two Agropyron species are infected with the\nspecies grouping into a novel single clade among Epichloë species and\nthey are closely related to a haploid of hybrid Neotyphodium species.\nThe host plant features may be a cause for the different type of\nconidiostromata between in A. ciliare var. minus and in A. tsukushiense\nvar. transiens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_705.phy"}]}
