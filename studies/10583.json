Nakajima et H.\nOkada, from Betung Kerihun National Park, West Kalimantan, Borneo,\nIndonesia, is described and illustrated. Kalimantanorchis resembles the\ngenus Tropidia Lindl. in flower and stem morphology, namely, mycotrophic\nhabit, branching stem, non-resupinate flowers with a saccate cymbiform\nlip bearing two longitudinal ridges along the margins, broadly\ntriangular rostellum, acute, triangular anther cap, and winged or\nthree-lobed column. It differs, however, in having a tuberous root\nsystem, pure ivory-white flower coloration and four pollinia. BLAST\nanalyses based on DNA sequences of chroloplast maturase K pseudogene and\nthe internal transcribed spacer of the nuclear ribosomal DNA also\nsuggest that the closest genus is Tropidia, but the similarity is low\nand molecular phylogenetic analysis denied it to be a member of Tropidia\nLindl., supporting the idea that this is a new genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tsukaya et al Fig","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9816.phy"}]}
