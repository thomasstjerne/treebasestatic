Breeding for resistance to this disease is crucial to avoid\nextensive fungicide applications that are costly, labor intensive and\nmay have detrimental effects on the environment. In the past decade,\nChinese Vitis species have attracted attention from grape breeders\nbecause of their strong resistance to powdery mildew and their lack of\nnegative fruit quality attributes that are often present in resistant\nNorth American species. In this study, we investigated powdery mildew\nresistance in multiple accessions of the Chinese species Vitis piasezkii\nthat were collected during the 1980 Sino-American botanical expedition\nto the western Hubei province of China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vitis piasezkii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97594.phy"}]}
