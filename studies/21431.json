This contradiction has not been resolved because of the\ndifficulty in isolating this fungus. In this study, we isolated two\nstrains from sexual and asexual morphs for molecular analysis. Both\nstrains were found to fall into the same clade in Pestalotiopsis s. str.\nas P. gaultheriae and P. spatulata in a phylogenetic tree of\nSporocadaceae based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS), Î²-tubulin, and\npartial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) sequence datasets.\nWe provide the first evidence that fungi producing cup-shaped ascomata\nin Pestalotiopsis belong to Sordariomycetes, and we have proposed the\ntransfer of Pestalopezia brunneopruinosa to Pestalotiopsis gibbosa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111815.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111816.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111817.phy"}]}
