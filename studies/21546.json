However, there are reports of this species as pathogenic in\nhumans, usually occurring in patients with some type of\nimmunosuppression that predisposes opportunistic infections. Specimens\nof this species were collected from water samples and Rhizophora mangle\nL. leaves at different salinities along the Perequê River. This river is\nlocated in a mangrove swamp area at “Parque Estadual da Ilha do\nCardoso”, Cananéia municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. Aliquots of\nthese samples were spread in Petri dishes. The samples baited with\ncataphiles of Allium cepa L. were incubated for 7 days at 21 º C. After\nincubation, the baits were observed under the microscope and the\nspecimens were isolated and purified. These specimens were identified\nbased on the phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA region. This is the\nfirst record of this species in São Paulo State.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudozyma ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106862.phy"}]}
