Fungi cause disease in\nmangroves, however, it is not clear if the diseases are unique to\nmangrove species or ubiquitous. In this study, we identified a species\nof Alternaria, a genus comprises saprobic and pathogenic species of a\nlarge number of plants. The genus is currently divided into 28 sections\nbased on phylogenetic and morphological evidence. Alternaria is\ncharacterized by macronematous conidiophores, sympodial, polytretic\nconidiogenous cells, and obclavate to obovoid, muriform conidia\ngradually tapering towards beaked apex. We found A. gaisen associated\nwith leaf blight of Ficus microcarpa and leaf spots of Kandelia candel\nfrom Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis of combined SSU, LSU, ITS, gapdh,\nrpb2, ef1Î±, Alta1, endoPG and OPA10-2 sequence data supports positioning\nof our isolates as A. gaisen in section Alternaria. This species was\nfirst reported from Japanese pear causing black spot disease. Native\nvegetation such as mangroves, may therefore provide a source of inoculum\nfor agricultural and horticultural diseases. This is also a new host\nrecord of A. gaisen from mangroves in Taiwan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125531","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125531.phy"}]}
