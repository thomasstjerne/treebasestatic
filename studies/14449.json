Presented in this report is findings of morphological and\nmolecular observations of naturally-occurring populations of this alga\ncollected from west and east coasts of India. Both the isolates had\nsimilar external as well as microscopic morphology. Nuclear ribosomal\nDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer-1 (ITS1) sequences from these\ngeographical isolates had 4.35 x 10-1 Tamura-3-Parameter (T3P) pairwise\ndistance between them, which indicate significant evolutionary\ndifferences accumulated over time. In comparison, T3P distance between\nrelated genera Kappaphycus and Eucheuma was 1.85 x 10-1. In our\nphylogeny reconstruction using Bayesian Inference, both the isolates\nformed a well-supported clade along with the only available accession of\nthis genus at ITS1 locus, indicating affiliation of both the isolates in\nthis genus. Interestingly, isolate from the west coast was more basal in\nthe phylogram, which suggests phylogenetically primitive position of\nthis population. Newly generated DNA barcodes of the geographical\nisolates of this native carragenophyte in this study is expected to be a\nkey in tracing its further dispersal routes, either natural or\ndeliberate. This is the first report on the comparative morphological\nand molecular assessment of Hypnea from India.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64782","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64782.phy"}]}
