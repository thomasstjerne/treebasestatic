Here we\ninvestigate the taxonomic statuses within one of the most abundant,\nwidespread, and polytypic Palearctic bumblebee Bombus pascuorum with a\nintegrative approach based on genetic markers and male chemical\nreproductive traits. The latest review of the species defined 24\nsubspecies. We use this taxonomic classifications as a priori for our\nanalyses. Our result show that all B. pascuorum taxa are conspecific and\nshare the same male chemical reproductive traits. The genetic structure\nobserved in one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers poorly reflect the\ncurrent subspecific classification. Indeed, the concordance of\npopulation genetic differentiation, population geographic distribution,\nand population colour pattern similarity suggest a different meaningful\nprospective classification with four taxon complexes: (i) the B.\npascuorum dusmeti group including all taxa from Iberian Peninsula and\nSouth/South West France, (ii) B. pascuorum rehbinderi, (iii) B.\npascuorum siciliensis, and (iv) B. pascuorum floralis groups (including\nall other here studied taxa).","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86559.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86560.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86561.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86562.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86563.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86556.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86557.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"285","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bombus pascuorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86558.phy"}]}
