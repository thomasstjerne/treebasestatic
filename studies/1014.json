From the 15 roots, we PCR amplified\nfungal DNAs and analyzed 156 clones that included the internal\ntranscribed spacer two (ITS2). From 150 different subsections of the\nsame roots, we cultured fungi and analyzed their ITS2 DNAs by RFLP\npatterns or sequencing. We mapped the original position of each root\nsection and recorded fungi detected in each. Phylogenetically, most\ncloned DNAs clustered among Sebacina spp. (Sebacinaceae, Basidiomycota).\nThe ascomycetes that predominated among the cultured fungi, Capronia sp.\nand Hymenoscyphus ericae, both formed intracellular hyphal coils in\nresynthesis experiments with salal. We illustrate patterns of fungal\ndiversity at the scale of individual roots and compare cloned and\ncultured fungi from each root. Indicating a systematic culturing\ndetection bias, Sebacina DNAs predominated in 10 of the 15 roots yet\nSebacina spp. never grew from cultures from the same roots or from among\nthe more than 200 ericoid mycorrhizal fungi previously cultured from\ndifferent roots from the same site.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"190","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salal endophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4168.phy"}]}
