Sequences comprising 2871 aligned base pair positions\nrepresenting the regions spanning ND1-COI and cyt b-tRNAThr of the\nmitochondrial genome from all recognized sand lizard species were\nanalyzed using unpartitioned parsimony and likelihood methods,\nlikelihood methods with assumed partitions, Bayesian methods with\nassumed partitions, and Bayesian mixture models. The topology (Uma,\n(Callisaurus, (Cophosaurus, Holbrookia))) and thus monophyly of the\n\u001aearless\u001a taxa, Cophosaurus and Holbrookia, is supported by all analyses.\nPreviously proposed topologies in which Uma and Callisaurus are sister\ntaxa and those in which Holbrookia is the sister group to all other sand\nlizard taxa are rejected using both parsimony and likelihood-based\nsignificance tests with the combined, unparitioned data set. Bayesian\nhypothesis tests also reject those topologies using six assumed\npartitioning strategies, and the two partitioning strategies presumably\nassociated with the most powerful tests also reject a third previously\nproposed topology, in which Callisaurus and Cophosaurus are sister taxa.\nFor both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods with assumed\npartitions, those partitions defined by codon position and tRNA stem and\nnonstems explained the data better than other strategies examined. Bayes\nfactor estimates comparing results of assumed partitions versus mixture\nmodels suggest that mixture models perform better than assumed\npartitions when the latter were not based on functional characteristics\nof the data, such as codon position and tRNA stem and nonstems. However,\nassumed partitions performed better than mixture models when functional\ndifferences were incorporated. We reiterate the importance of accounting\nfor heterogeneous evolutionary processes in the analysis of complex data\nsets and emphasize the importance of implementing mixed model likelihood\nmethods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"constraintsTopology4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5030.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraintsTopology1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5033.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraints Holbrookia monophyly","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5026.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraints Cophosaurus monophyly","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5027.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraints Callisaurus monophyly","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5028.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraints Uma monophyly","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5029.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraintsTopology3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5031.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraintsTopology2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5032.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2.3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2.2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5035.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2.1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5036.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phrynosomatine Sand Lizards","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5037.phy"}]}
