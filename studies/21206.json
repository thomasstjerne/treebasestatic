Phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated\ndata set, consisting of sequences of the translation elongation factor\n1-α and β-tubulin genes, and the intergenic spacer of the ribosomal DNA,\nidentified nine three-locus sequence types, each of which corresponded\nto an SCG. Six SCGs were present only in California, two only in Mexico,\nand one in both California and Mexico. An isolate associated with the\nmost common SCG in California was tested for pathogenicity on blueberry,\nraspberry, strawberry and lettuce. All blueberry, raspberry and lettuce\nplants that were inoculated remained healthy, but two of the five\nstrawberry cultivars tested developed symptoms. The three strawberry\ncultivars that were resistant to the blackberry pathogen were also\nresistant to F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, the cause of Fusarium wilt\nof strawberry. We propose to designate strains of F. oxysporum that are\npathogenic to blackberry as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. mori forma\nspecialis nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. mori MLT IGS sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105792.phy"}]}
