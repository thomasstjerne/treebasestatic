Two primary hypotheses have been\nproposed for the origin of such endemic lineages; the first suggests a\nvicariant origin arising from the sundering of eastern Gondwana in the\nCretaceous. The second posits more recent dispersal and colonization. We\nuse concatenated and coalescent time calibrated phylogenies to test\nwhether New Caledonian diplodactyloid geckos diversified steadily\nfollowing an ancient vicariance event or experienced an early burst of\ndiversification followed by a decline in net diversification after\nlong-distance dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S5","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New Caledonian Geckos mtDNA + 5 partial nuclear exons\nRAxML bipartitions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95518.phy"}]}
