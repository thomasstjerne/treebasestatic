Here, we provide a detailed macroscopic and microscopic\ndescription and photographs of this rarely collected species based on\nmaterial collected in Illinois in oak-hickory forest. Analysis of\nmolecular phylogenetic data strongly supports an evolutionary alliance\nwith Asian and Australasian species of the Inocybe asterospora group.\nThe combination of stellate basidiospores, marginate stipe base,\nentirely pruinose stipe, rimose pileus, and strong distinctive odor\ncorroborates the molecular results, but the closest relatives of I.\ninsignis lack the greenish bluish staining characteristic of I.\ninsignis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90880","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90880.phy"}]}
