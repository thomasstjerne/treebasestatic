I cloned cDNAs for putative photoreceptors of P.\ncrystallinus. Three genes named pcmada1, pcmada2 and pcmada3 were\nidentified from the PCR fragments, amplified with degenerated primers\nfor the LOV domain which is conserved in many blue-light receptors.\nDeduced amino acid sequences for PCMADA1, PCMADA2 and PCMADA3 had one\nlight, oxygen or voltage (LOV) and two PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domains. A\nzinc finger DNA binding motif was conserved in the C terminals of\nPCMADA1 and PCMADA3. However PCMADA2 lacked the zinc finger motif.\nExpression of pcmada1 was suppressed by blue light, while that of\npcmada3 was promoted by blue light irradiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"madA homologs in Pilobolus crystallinus, LOV\ndomain","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6590.phy"}]}
