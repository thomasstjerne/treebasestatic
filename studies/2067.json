Previous phylogenetic\nanalyses show strong support for Hydroidolina monophyly, but the\nrelationships between and within its subgroups remain uncertain. In an\neffort to further clarify hydroidolinan relationships, we performed\nphylogenetic analyses on 97 hydroidolinan taxa, using DNA sequences from\npartial mitochondrial 16S rDNA, nearly complete nuclear 18S rDNA and\nnearly complete nuclear 28S rDNA. Our findings are consistent with\nprevious analyses that support monophyly of Siphonophorae and\nLeptothecata and do not support monophyly of Anthoathecata nor its\ncomponent subgroups, Filifera and Capitata. Instead, within\nAnthoathecata, we find support for four separate filiferan clades and\ntwo separate capitate clades (Aplanulata and Capitata sensu stricto).\nOur data however, lack any substantive support for discerning\nrelationships between these eight distinct hydroidolinan clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydroidolina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1066.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydroidolina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1067.phy"}]}
