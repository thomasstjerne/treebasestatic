This\ncyanobacterium belongs to the genus Synechococcus, and occurs in the\nsurface tissues of these sponges, as demonstrated with Fluorescent In\nSitu Hybridization (FISH) using a species-specific DNA probe, and with\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The cyanobacterial symbiont\nìAphanocapsa feldmanniiî (Fremy), hosted by the marine sponge Petrosia\nficiformis from the Mediterranean Sea, is a separate, but closely\nrelated, species also belonging to the genus Synechococcus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyanobacterial symbiont from a sponge","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4231.phy"}]}
