The genus\nXenocylindrocladium has thus far been known from one species, X.\nserpens, which was described from plant debris collected in Ecuador. The\ntwo new taxa are compared with and distinguished from X. serpens based\non morphology, cultural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of DNA\nsequence data of the 5.8S rDNA with flanking ITS1 and ITS2 regions and\nthe 5â€™ end of the b-tubulin gene. These species are also compared with\nother closely related hypocrealean taxa. Present collection data suggest\nthat species of Xenocylindrocladium could be restricted to the\ntropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hyphomycetes tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3781.phy"}]}
