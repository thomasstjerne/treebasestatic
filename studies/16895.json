The phylogenetic relationships of these new species within the\ngenus are inferred from an analysis of ITS and nLSU-rDNA sequences.\nExcept I. keralensis that belongs to the Pseudosperma clade, all other\nspecies belong to the Inocybe clade. This study forms the second report\nof an Inocybe species (I. muthangensis) that combines entirely\nviolet-colored basidiomata with nodulose basidiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97436.phy"}]}
