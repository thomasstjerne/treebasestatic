Not much is known about the genetic diversity of\nthis pathogen worldwide. In Vietnam it is the causal agent of\ndevastating diseases on several hosts, including chilli and black\npepper. Cross-infectivity of these P. capsici isolates obtained from the\ntwo hosts was demonstrated. Analysis of forty-six P. capsici isolates\nbased on Random Amplified Microsatellites (RAMS) and Repetitive\nExtragenic Palindromic (REP) fingerprinting revealed that isolates from\nblack pepper were genetically distinct from isolates recovered from\nchilli. Twenty-two isolates from chilli clustered into two clonal groups\nat a DICE similarity level of > 85%, whereas twenty-four isolates\nfrom black pepper were separated from these chilli isolates at a\nsimilarity level of <50%. In general the genetic diversity among\nisolates of P. capsici from black pepper was greater than that of the\nchilli isolates. The current study indicated that the P. capsici\npopulation infecting chilli and black pepper in Vietnam consists of two\nseparate genetic strains, adapted to chilli and black pepper, despite\ntheir morphological similarity and host cross-infectivity. The\nimplications of these findings are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50957","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50957.phy"}]}
