These species are described\nhere as Spathaspora girioi sp. nov., Spathaspora hagerdaliae sp. nov.,\nand Spathaspora gorwiae sp. nov. Differentiation of new species was\nbased on analyses of the gene encoding the D1/D2 sequences of large\nsubunit of rRNA and on 514 conserved, single-copy, orthologous genes\nfrom the analyses of genome sequence assemblies from the newly described\nspecies and 19 closely-related Debaryomycetaceae /Metschnikowiaceae\nspecies. Spathaspora girioi sp. nov. produced unconjugated asci with a\nsingle elongated ascospore with curved ends; however, ascospore\nformation was not observed for the other two novel species. The three\nnovel species ferment D-xylose with different efficiencies in medium\nwith 3% D-xylose or in co-culture with 3% glucose and 3% D-xylose.\nSpathaspora hagerdaliae sp. nov. and Spathaspora girioi sp. nov. showed\nxylose reductase (XR) activity that was strictly dependent on NADPH,\nwhereas Spathaspora gorwiae sp. nov. had XR activity that used both NADH\nand NADPH as co-factors. The genes that encode enzymes involved in\nxylose metabolism (xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and\nxylulokinase) were also determined for these novel species. The type\nstrains are Spathaspora girioi sp. nov. UFMG-CM-Y302T (=CBS 13476),\nSpathaspora hagerdaliae f.a., sp. nov. UFMG-CM-Y303T (=CBS 13475), and\nSpathaspora gorwiae f.a., sp. nov. UFMG-CM-Y312T (=CBS 13472).","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93128","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93128.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93129.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93130","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93130.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93131","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93131.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93132","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93132.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree5","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93133","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93133.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree6","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93134","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93134.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree7","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93135","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93135.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree8","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93136","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93136.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree9","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93137","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93137.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree10","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93138.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree11","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93139","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93139.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree12","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93140","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93140.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree13","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93141","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93141.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree14","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93142","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93142.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree15","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93143","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93143.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree16","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93144.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree17","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93145.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree18","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93146.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree19","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93147.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree20","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93148","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93148.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree21","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93149.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree22","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93150.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree23","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93151.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree24","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93152.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree25","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93153.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree26","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93154.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree27","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93155.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree28","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93156.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree29","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93157.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree642","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93158.phy"}]}
