The resultant 48 genera\nand generic groupings comprising 19 families from within the\nAsparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales were then analysed. The\ncladistics largely supported previous treatments, with the Liliales,\nDioscoreales and Asparagales all monophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lilliaflorae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4326.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lilliaflorae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4327.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lilliaflorae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4320.phy"}]}
