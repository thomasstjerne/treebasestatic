Previous studies in P. radiata have been mainly\nbased on fungal isolation. This study aimed to identify as many fungal\nspecies as possible that were associated with P. radiata needles in\nTasmanian plantations by a direct PCR approach, using a reference\ncollection of isolates from Tasmania, mainland Australia and New\nZealand. Dothideomycetes was the most diverse group detected in this\nstudy, with many OTUs infrequently detected by direct PCR and not\nisolated. Leotiomycetes was the second most diverse order and\nSordariomycetes third, with many OTUs being frequently isolated but\nrarely or not at all detected by direct PCR. DNA sequence data\nfacilitated the discrimination and identification of OTUs, but some\neffort was required to eliminate sequences from poorly identified\nisolates in public DNA databases.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70731","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70731.phy"}]}
