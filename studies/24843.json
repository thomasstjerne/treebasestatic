The resultant species diversity of this primary-colonizing\n(incumbent) clade may limit subsequent lineages ability to persist\nunless these non-incumbent lineages are ecologically distinct. We\ncompare the diversity in diet-related mandibular morphology of two\nsympatric murine rodent clades endemic to Luzon Island,\nPhilippinesincumbent Phloeomyini and secondary-colonizing Chrotomyinito\nthe diversity of Sahul Hydromyini, the sister clade of Chrotomyini and\nthe incumbent murine lineage on the supercontinent of Sahul. This\nthree-clade comparison allows us to test the hypothesis that incumbent\nlineages force persistent ecological distinction of subsequent colonists\nat the time of colonization and throughout the subsequent history of the\ntwo sympatric clades. We find that Chrotomyini forms a subset of the\ndiversity of their clade plus Sahul Hydromyini that minimizes overlap\nwith Phloeomyini. We also infer that this differentiation extends to the\nstem ancestor of Chrotomyini and Sahul Hydromyini, consistent with a\nbiotic filter imposed by Phloeomyini. Our work illustrates that\nincumbency may have a profound influence on the ecomorphological\ndiversity of colonizing lineages at the island scale even when the\ntraits in question are evolving at similar rates across the tree.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE
