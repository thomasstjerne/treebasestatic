Multiple taxa,\nincluding apparent endemics, are known from that region, however, they\nhave thus far not been exposed to phylogenetic analyses aimed at\nstudying their relationships to taxa from other parts of the world. Here\nwe present a comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of the R. maritima\ncomplex using data sets composed of DNA sequences of the plastid genome,\nthe multi-copy nuclear ITS region, and the low-copy nuclear phyB gene\nwith a primary focus on the Mediterranean representatives of the\ncomplex. As a result, a new lineage, âDrepanensisâ, was identified as\nthe seventh entity of the complex. This lineage is endemic to the\nMediterranean. The accessions included in the former âTetraploidâ entity\nwere reclassified into two entities: an Asiaâ“Australiaâ“Europe disjunct\nâTetraploid_Î±â with a paternal âDiploidâ origin, and a European\nâTetraploid_Î³â originating from a maternal âDrepanensisâ lineage.\nAnother entity, âTetraploid_Î²â, is likely to have been originated as a\nresult of chloroplast capture through backcrossing hybridization between\npaternal âTetraploid_Î±â and maternal âTetraploid_Î³â. Additional\ndiscovery of multiple tetraploidizations as well as hybridization and\nchloroplast capture at the tetraploid level indicated that hybridization\nhas been a significant factor in the diversification of Ruppia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 9+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia maritima","tree_kind":"Species
