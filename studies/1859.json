Three major clades were recognized, each corresponding to\nthe chromosome base number, x = 6, 7, and 8/10. Bongardia was sister to\nthe clade containing Achlys and the Podophyllum group, which consists of\nDiphylleia, Sinopodophyllum, Podophyllum, and Dysosma. The estimated\ntimes of divergence of six disjunct genera between Eurasia and North\nAmerica ranged from 7.5 - 2.3 Ma to 1.0 - 0.7 Ma. The intercontinental\ndisjunct lineages of Berberidaceae may have originated in eastern Asia\nand then migrated to Europe and North America. However, long-distance\ndispersal may explain the distribution pattern of Achlys. Desert\nxerophytes of Berberidaceae in southwestern Asia originated in response\nto the advent of dry climate at different times; Bongardia diverged from\nits closest relatives at 46.5 - 3.6 Ma, whereas Leontice differentiated\nfrom Gymnospermium at 10.3 - 3.2 Ma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 RR","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berberidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_999.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berberidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1000.phy"}]}
