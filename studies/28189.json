Lecanora parasymmicta\nis distinguishable from Lecanora symmicta (Ach.) Ach., the most similar\nspecies, by areolate-rimose thallus, blackish prothallus, larger\napothecia, absence of thalline margin from the beginning, narrower\nparaphyses, larger ascospores, smaller pycnoconidia, and the presence of\nplacodiolic acid. The second new species Protoparmeliopsis\ncrystalliniformis differs from Protoparmeliopsis ertzii by whitish\nthallus, flat to concave and paler disc, longer ascospores, thallus K+\nyellow reaction, presence of atranorin and rhizocarpic acid, and the\nsubstrate preference to sandstone or basalt. Molecular analyses\nemploying internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and mitochondrial small\nsubunit (mtSSU) sequences strongly support the two lecanoroid species to\nbe distinct in their genera. A surrogate key is provided to assist in\nthe identification of Protoparmeliopsis species in Korea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanora ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130908.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for ML","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanora mtSSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130909.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanora mtSSU Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130910.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 for ML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protoparmeliopsis ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130911.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 for ML","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protoparmeliopsis mtSSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130913.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protoparmeliopsis mtSSU Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for ML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanora ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130907.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protoparmeliopsis ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130912.phy"}]}
