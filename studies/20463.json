However, their\nphylogenetic diversity patterns among different geographic populations\nand different substrates are completely unknown. In this study, the\nspecies of the A. vulgare complex that occurs on old cones of pine trees\nfrom many parts of China were studied phylogenetically, morphologically\nand ecologically. Our phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide\nsequences the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 with the 5.8S nrDNA\n(ITS), the large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (nrLSU), the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1-α) gene, and the region between\nthe conserved domain 6 and 7 of the gene for the second largest subunit\nof RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and the partial sequence of the homeodomain\n(HD) of the mating gene indicated that three phylogenetic species can be\nrecognized, which correspond well with morphological and ecological\nevidence. Therefore, three species, with two new to science, are\ndocumented here, namely the well-known A. vulgare, and the newly\ndescribed species A. orientale and A. microsporum. Although A. vulgare\nis restricted in the northeastern parts of China and the new species are\nmainly in the south, they all have distinct substrate specificities or\npreferences. Our cophylogenetic analyses indicated that both\ncospeciation, and duplication and host switch contributed to the\nspeciation of A. vulgare complex. In conclusion, ecological adaptations\nto different substrates have driven the formation of the species in the\nA. vulgare complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112052.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mating gene","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mating gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112054.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112050.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112049.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-LSU-RPB2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS-LSU-RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112051.phy"},{"tree_label":"mating gene20181211","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mating gene20181211","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115122.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112053.phy"}]}
