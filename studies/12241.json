T. populinum has wind-dispersed\nprogagules and may be capable of long-distance dispersal. In this study,\nwe tested the hypothesis of a panmictic population between Scandinavia\nand North America.  DNA sequences from five nuclear loci were used to\nassess phylogeographic structure and nucleotide divergence between\ncontinents.  Tricholoma populinum was composed of Scandinavian and North\nAmerican lineages with complete absence of shared haplotypes and only\none shared nucleotide mutation. Divergence of these lineages was\nestimated at approx. 1.71.0 million yr ago (Ma), which occurred after\nthe estimated divergence of host species Populus tremula and Populus\nbalsamifera ⁄ Populus trichocarpa at 5 Ma. Phylogeographic structure was\nnot observed within Scandinavian or North American lineages of T.\npopulinum.  Intercontinental divergence appears to have resulted from\neither allopatric isolation; a recent, rare long-distance dispersal\nfounding event followed by genetic drift; or the response in an obligate\nmycorrhizal fungus with a narrow host range to contractions and\nexpansion of host distribution during glacial and interglacial episodes\nwithin continents. Understanding present genetic variation in\npopulations is important for predicting how obligate symbiotic fungi\nwill adapt to present and future changing climatic conditions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50281.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50282.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50285.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50283","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50283.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50284.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50286","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50286.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50289.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50290","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50290.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50291","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50291.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50292","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50292.phy"}]}
