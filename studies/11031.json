Data from ITS and LSU nu rDNA demonstrate that a high\nbiodiversity of fungal species is involved. There are two common\nantefungus symbioses involving black yeasts: (1) on the carton walls of\nant nests and galleries, and (2) the fungal mats growing within\nnon-pathogenic naturally hollow structures (so-called domatia) provided\nby myrmecophytic plants as nesting space for ants (anteplant symbiosis).\nMost carton- and domatiainhabiting fungi stem from different\nphylogenetic lineages within Chaetothyriales, and almost all of the\nfungi isolated are still undescribed. Despite being closely related,\ncarton and domatia fungi are shown to differ markedly in their\nmorphology and ecology, indicating that they play different roles in\nthese associations. The carton fungi appear to improve the stability of\nthe carton, and several species are commonly observed to co-occur on the\nsame carton. Carton fungi commonly have dark-walled monilioid hyphae,\ncolouring the carton blackish and apparently preventing other fungi from\ninvading the carton. Despite the simultaneous presence of usually\nseveral species of fungi, forming complex associations on the carton,\nlittle overlap is observed between carton fungi from different ant\nspecies, even those that co-occur in nature, indicating at least some\nhost specificity of fungi. Most fungi present on carton belong to\nChaetothyriales, but in a few samples, Capnodiales are also an important\ncomponent. Carton fungi are difficult to assign to anamorph genera, as\nmost lack conidiation. The domatia fungi are more specific. In domatia,\nusually only one or two fungal species co-occur, producing a dense layer\non living host plant tissue in domatia. They have hyaline or light brown\nthin-walled hyphae, and are commonly sporulating. In both carton and\ndomatia, the fungal species seemto be specific to each anteplant\nsymbiosis. Representative examples of carton and domatia antefungus\nsymbioses are illustrated. We discuss hypotheses on the ecological\nsignificance of the Chaetothyriales associated with ants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ant-Associated Black
