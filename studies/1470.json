The coevolutionary history with their goby\nhosts was investigated using both topology- and distance-based\napproaches; phylogenies were constructed of the V4 region of the 18S\nrRNA and the complete ITS rDNA region for the parasites, and 12S and 16S\nmtDNA fragments for the hosts. The overall fit between both trees was\nsignificant according to the topology-based programs (TreeMap 1.0, 2.0?\nand TreeFitter), but not according to the timed analysis in TreeMap 2.0?\nand the distance based method (ParaFit). An absolute timing of\nspeciation events in host and parasite ruled out the possibility of\nsynchronous speciation for the gill parasites, favouring the\ndistance-based result. Based on this information together with the\nbiological background of host and parasite, the following TreeMap\nsolution was selected. The group of gill parasites evolved from a host\nswitch from G. arcuatus, parasitizing the three-spined stickleback onto\nthe gobies, followed by several host-switching events among the\nrespective goby hosts. The timing of these events is estimated to date\nback to the Late Pleistocene, suggesting a role for refugia-mediated\nmixing of parasite species. In contrast, it is suggested that\ncospeciation in the fin-parasites resulted in several host-associated\nspecies complexes. This illustrates that phylogenetically conserved\nhost-switching mimics the phylogenetic signature of cospeciation,\nconfounding topology-based programs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fin Parasites","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_251.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gill Parasites","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_322.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_498.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.3","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_499.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_500.phy"},{"tree_label":"All Parasites","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Flatworms and Gobies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2371.phy"}]}
