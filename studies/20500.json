Sequencing and\nanalyses of the large subunit (LSU) of ribosomal RNA genes, the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1)\nand Calmodulin (CAL) genes confirmed their placement in\nPseudopyricularia. Pseudopyricularia hyrcaniana was isolated as a\npathogen from infected leaves of Cyperus alternifolius, while P. javanii\nwas from Juncus effusus. Conidia of P. hyrcaniana are obpyriform or\nobclavate and 1-septate; those of P. javanii are fusiform or\ncylindrical, and 2-septates, that distinguish two species from each\nother and species. Analysis of multigene sequences confirm the\ndistinction between P. hyrcaniana and P. javanii and reveal their\nrelationship with the allies in Pyriculariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Baysean","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101770.phy"}]}
