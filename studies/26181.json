We identified five additional species that are not yet fully\ncharacterized and are not provided with formal species recognition. This\nis the first taxonomic treatment highlighting the high species richness\nwithin the Phreatoicidea that occur in Australia and likely elsewhere.\nWe document each species fully with scanning electron and light\nmicrographic images, diagnoses, detailed descriptions, keys to\nidentification and justification of each species using parsimony\nanalysis of their morphological and genetic characters. The\ndistributional data show that all species, except for one, have\nmicroendemic distributions, with some sibling species occurring within a\nfew kilometers of each other. Because of the age of this group of\nspecies, they appear to have spread throughout the region of the Arnhem\nsandstone plateau and then back-colonized the same habitats so that as\nmany as three morphologically and genetically distinct species may\nco-occur syntopically. Our research has uncovered a new genus-level\ntaxon of the family Amphisopidae, Kakadubeh gen. nov. This new genus is\nunlike Eophreatoicus, not only in its general appearance, but also in\nhaving an inferred reproductive strategy different from most of the\nother members of the family. While Eophreatoicus species have males that\nare much larger than the females and practice precopula, a form of\npre-insemination mate guarding, males of the new species, Kakadubeh\nrangemyahwurd sp. nov., are much smaller than females. In addition,\nmales of this species have a fourth walking leg that is not specialized\nfor holding females, suggesting that they have a reproductive strategy\nthat does not involve precopula of the form seen in Eophreatoicus and\nEremisopus Wilson & Keable, 2002a. Most of our research has been\nundertaken in Kakadu National Park, although recent collections have\nbeen made in Arnhem Land, yielding additional distinctive species. Given\nthe size of unexplored territory around the Arnhem Plateau and the\ngeographic frequency of discovering new species, we predict that the\ndiversity of this group in the Northern Territory may be many more than\nthe ~35 species described here. At this time, these microendemic isopods\nappear to be unthreatened by human activities, largely owing to the\nenvironmental protection afforded by Kakadu National Park and Arnhem\nLand, and their cryptic habits during the dry season. Because they are\ndependent on small springs of permanent groundwater, future changes in\nhydrology owing to water use and climate change, as well as invasive\nintroduced species, may present risks to populations and species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tnt 3++","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amphisopidae morphA no outgroups 20190321= wts","tree_kind":"Species
