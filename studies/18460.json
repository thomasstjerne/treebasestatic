Mutational bias at\nneutrally evolving sites produces heterogeneous base composition among\ntaxa, causing systematic error. We compare eight phylogenetic methods in\nanalyses of a large phylogeny (>600 tips) based on one mammalian\nmitochondrial gene with significant base composition heterogeneity at\nsaturated, neutrally evolving sites. Using hierarchical Bayesian\nregressions, we modelled the probability of inferring clades (families\nor genera) as a function of phylogenetic methods and clade-specific\ncharacteristics. Results: Most methods incurred in misspecification from\nmutational bias, and composition heterogeneity contributed to systematic\nerror for divergences between genera. Modelling the nucleotide\nreplacement process in many site categories or codon evolution were both\ninsufficient to overcome composition heterogeneity. Analysing the\nprotein alignment failed to improve overall inference despite no\nheterogeneity in amino acid composition or loss of phylogenetic signal.\nThe best-performing method recoded nucleotides to purines and\npyrimidines at synonymous sites and analysed these as binary characters.\nConclusions: Evaluating the effects of base composition heterogeneity at\nneutrally evolving sites is indispensable. Significant heterogeneity\nneeds to directly modelled or, when appropriate, addressed using\npurine-pyrimidine and binary recoding. Unless base composition\nheterogeneity is accounted for, ever-larger phylogenomic data sets may\nincur in systematic error.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammals 01 3rd pos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92116.phy"},{"tree_label":"RY_tree","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95091.phy"},{"tree_label":"Protein_AA","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95092.phy"},{"tree_label":"gtr cat","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammals gtr cat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91801.phy"},{"tree_label":"Original Agnarsson","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammals Original Agnarsson","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91797.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ LogDet distance","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammals NJ LogDet distance","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91798.phy"},{"tree_label":"garli codon model","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammals garli codon model","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_91800.phy"},{"tree_label":"3diffModels","ntax":"658","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95090.phy"}]}
