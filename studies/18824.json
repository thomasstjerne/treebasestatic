Combined with the morphological characters a new genus,\nPseudofibroporia gen. nov., is established. Three new species,\nFibroporia bambusae sp. nov. , Fibroporia ceracea sp. nov. and\nPseudofibroporia citrina sp. nov. are descibed from China. Illustrated\ndescriptions of the novel species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fibroporia ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107811.phy"}]}
