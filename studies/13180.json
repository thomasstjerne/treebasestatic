The western\nlandmass, known as Laramidia, although diminutive in size, witnessed a\nmajor evolutionary radiation of dinosaurs. Other than hadrosaurs\n(duck-billed dinosaurs), the most common dinosaurs were ceratopsids\n(large-bodied horned dinosaurs), currently known only from Laramidia and\nAsia. Remarkably, previous studies have postulated the occurrence of\nlatitudinally arrayed dinosaur “provinces,” or “biomes,” on Laramidia.\nYet this hypothesis has been challenged on multiple fronts and has\nremained poorly tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55861.phy"}]}
