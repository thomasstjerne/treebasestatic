This mutualism has evolved in multiple beetle and fungus\nlineages, but whether convergence in ecology led to convergent\nmetabolism in ambrosia fungi is not known. We compared the assimilation\nof 190 carbon sources in five independent lineages of ambrosia fungi and\nclosely related, non-ambrosial species. These repeated comparisons, and\nthe use of variation partitioning to separate the effects of phylogeny\nand ecology, enabled us to assess functional convergence versus\nphylogenetic divergence in the metabolic diversity of ambrosia fungi.\nOur results revealed no convergence in carbon utilization capacities\namong ambrosia fungi. Instead, metabolic variation among fungi was\nlargely explained by phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the range\nof carbon usage in ambrosia fungi was equally as diverse as that in\nnon-ambrosial species. Our results demonstrate that carbon metabolism of\neach ambrosia fungus is determined by its inherited metabolism, rather\nby the transition towards symbiosis. In contrast to other fungus-farming\nsystems of termites and attine ants, the fungal symbionts of ambrosia\nbeetles are functionally diverse, which reflects their independent\nevolutionary origins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110189.phy"}]}
