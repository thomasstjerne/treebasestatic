Two regions were\nstudied: from 53°N to 54°N, and 46°N to 49°N. A total of 54 species were\nidentified. Twenty-eight taxa were found only in the northern region,\nand five were unique to the southern region. A new aquatic hyphomycete,\nDwayaangam colodena sp. nov., was found mostly in northern streams. It\nis described along with its taxonomic position.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dwayaangam colodena sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4629.phy"}]}
