Fasciodontia yunnanensis is characterised by\nresupinate basidiomata with minutely odontioid hymenial surface and\npresence of submoniliform cystidia, and ellipsoid thick-walled\nbasidiospores (3.15.7 × 2.14.1 µm). Sequences of ITS and nLSU gene\nregions were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods.\nThe phylogenetic reconstruction of Hyphodontia s.l. based on a\nconcatenated ITS+nLSU dataset showed that the new species nested in\nFasciodontia, in which it formed a monophyletic lineage and then grouped\nwith F. brasiliensis and F. bugellensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fasciodontia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133734.phy"}]}
