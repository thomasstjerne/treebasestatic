Recently, the group was found to be\npolyphyletic based on molecular data, and has been segregated into\nmultiple genera. Not all Cosmospora-like fungi have been treated\nsystematically. Some of these species include C. vilior and many\nspecimens often labeled as “Cosmospora sp.” The objectives of this\nresearch were to establish the identity of C. vilior through\nepitypication using a recent collection that agrees with the type\nspecimen in morphology, host and geography, and to determine its\nphylogenetic position within Cosmospora sensu lato and the Nectriaceae.\nA multilocus phylogeny was constructed based on six loci (ITS, LSU,\nrpb1, MCM7, tef1, and tub) to estimate a phylogeny. Results from the\nphylogenetic analyses indicated that C. vilior forms a monophyletic\ngroup with other Cosmopora-like fungi that have an acremonium-like\nanamorph and that parasitize Eutypa and Eutypella (Ascomycota,\nSordariomycetes, Xylariales, Diatrypaceae). The group is\nphylogenetically distinct from other previously segregated genera. A new\ngenus, Pseudocosmospora is described to accommodate the type species, P.\neutypellae, and nine additional species in this clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62238.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62261","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62261.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62260","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62260.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62262","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62262.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62268.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62263","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62263.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62265","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62265.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62269","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62269.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62267.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62266","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62266.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62282.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62276.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62239","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62239.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62264.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62270","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62270.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62271","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62271.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62272","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62272.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62274","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62274.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62273","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62273.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62275","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62275.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62278","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62278.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62277.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62279","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62279.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62280.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62281.phy"}]}
