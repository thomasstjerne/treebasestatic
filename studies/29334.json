The gall rust pathogen was identified\nas Uromycladium falcatariae, in a recent study using molecular\napproaches. However, the molecular study of the F. moluccana gall rust\npathogen from Indonesia has not been reported. Therefore, here we aimed\nto study this through molecular phylogenetic of the internal transcribed\nspacer-5.8S rDNA (ITS), the cytochrome oxidase 3 (CO3) gene, and the\ngene encoding the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) as well as analyses of\nits spore dimensions. For this purpose, we collected isolates of the\ngall rust pathogen of F. moluccana from three provinces in Java and one\nprovince in Sumatra. The average spore lengths were 21.3522.74 μm and\nthe widths were 19.4520.15 μm, with the isolate from Bengkulu, having\nthe largest spore dimension. For the number of striae, isolate from\nCentral Java had a wider range (2538 μm) compared to other isolates.\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the ITS, LSU, and CO3 fragments using\nmaximum likelihood revealed a genetically distinct group of the gall\nrust pathogen of F. moluccana originating from the various provinces in\nIndonesia with isolates from the Philippines and Timor Leste.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135429.phy"}]}
