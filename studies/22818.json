We could not locate any type material\nfor this species. Furthermore, there is no molecular data generated for\nthe type of this species. Therefore, an epitype is designated for the\nprecise delineation of this taxon. A detailed morphological description\nand DNA characterization with LSU, SSU, ITS and TEF1 sequence data are\nprovided for the epitype, obtained from Spartina culms in Eastney,\nLangstone Harbour, Hampshire, UK.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halobyssothecium LSU SSU TEF ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112838.phy"}]}
