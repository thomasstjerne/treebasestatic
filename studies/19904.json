Current criteria for\nspecies recognition and host specificity in Elsinoë are unclear due to\noverlapping morphological characteristics, and the lack of molecular and\npathogenicity data. In the present study we revised the taxonomy of\nElsinoë based on DNA sequence and morphological data derived from 119\nisolates, representing 67 host genera from 17 countries, including 41\nex-type cultures. Combined analyses of ITS, LSU, rpb2 and TEF1-α DNA\nsequence data were used to reconstruct the backbone phylogeny of the\ngenus Elsinoë. Based on the single nomenclature for fungi, 26 new\ncombinations are proposed in Elsinoë for species that were originally\ndescribed in Sphaceloma. A total of 13 species are epitypified with\nnotes on their taxonomy and phylogeny. A further eight new species are\nintroduced, leading to a total of 75 Elsinoë species supported by\nmolecular data in the present study. For the most part species of\nElsinoë appear to be host specific, although the majority of the species\ntreated are known only from a few isolates, and further collections and\npathogenicity studies will be required to reconfirm this\nconclusion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsinoe ITS-LSU-RPB2-TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100544.phy"}]}
