Previous phylogenetic studies of A. flavus have shown that it\nconsists of two subgroups, called groups I and II, and morphological\nstudies indicated that it consists of two morphological groups based on\nsclerotium size, called S and L. The industrially important\nnon-aflatoxin producing fungus A. oryzae is nested within group I. Three\ndifferent gene regions, including part of a gene involved involved in\naflatoxin biosynthesis (omt12), were sequenced in 33 S and L strains of\nA. flavus collected from various regions around the world, along with\nthree isolates of A. oryzae, and two isolates of A. parasiticus that\nwere used as outgroups. The production of B and G aflatoxins and\ncyclopiazonic acid was analyzed in the A. flavus isolates, and each\nisolate was identified as S or L based on sclerotium size. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of all three genes confirmed the inference that group I and\ngroup II represent a deep divergence within A. flavus. Most group I\nstrains produced B aflatoxins to some degree, and none produced G\naflatoxins. Four out of six group II strains produced both B and G\naflatoxins. All group II isolates were of the S sclerotium phenotype,\nwhereas group I strains consisted of both S and L isolates. Based on the\nomt12 gene region, phylogenetic structure in sclerotium phenotype and\naflatoxin production was evident within group I. Some non-aflatoxin\nproducing isolates of group I had an omt12 allele that was identical to\nthat found in isolates of A. oryzae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"amds PAUP 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 1 of 4 MP trees - amdS12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3612.phy"},{"tree_label":"amds PAUP 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 2 of 4 MP trees - amdS12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3613.phy"},{"tree_label":"amds PAUP 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 3 of 4 MP trees - amdS12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3614.phy"},{"tree_label":"amds PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 4 of 4 MP trees - amdS12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3615.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 8","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 1 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3616.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 7","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 2 or 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3617.phy"},{"tree_label":"trpc PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 1 MP tree - trpC13 data set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3624.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 6","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 3 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3618.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 5","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 4 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3619.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 5 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3620.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 6 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3621.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 7 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3622.phy"},{"tree_label":"omt PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus flavus 8 of 8 MP trees - omt12 data\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3623.phy"}]}
