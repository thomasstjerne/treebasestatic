Due to the limitation of\nhabitat availability, demographic histories of species in Taiwan were\nstrongly influenced by glacial-interglacial cycles. Nevertheless, there\nare relatively few studies demonstrating such phylogeographic patterns\nfor islands, especially in subtropical Asia. In this study, we aim to\nconstruct the genetic landscape of a philopatric stream frog Buergeria\nrobusta by an intense and fine-scaled collection throughout the island.\nThe deduced genetic landscape of Buergeria robusta presented extremely\nhigh congruence with the actual topography of Taiwan. Two major lineages\nwere found on the eastern and the western sides of Taiwan with a\nnon-overlapping distribution, indicating the importance of the Central\nMountain Range as the major biogeographic barrier. Both clades showed a\nstrong and congruent tendency of demographic or distributional expansion\nin recent history based on different analyses, indicating that\npopulation fluctuations were strongly influenced by glaciations. The\nstrong association among geologic landscape, climate oscillation, and\npopulation genetic structure convinced that this stream frog stands for\na suitable species sensitively reflecting the influence of topographic\nand geologic factors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
