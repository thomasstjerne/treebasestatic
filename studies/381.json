This chrysomelid genus is characteristically\nassociated with a high number of different plant families. The diverse\nmolecular data gathered in this study are to a large extent congruent,\nand the analyses provide a well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis to\naddress questions about the evolution of host-plant shifts in the genus\nGonioctena. The most-parsimonious reconstruction of the ancestral\nhost-plant associations, based on the estimated phylogeny, suggests that\nthe Fabaceae was the ancestral host-plant family of the genus. Although\nmost of the host-plant shifts (between different host species) in\nGonioctena have occurred within the same plant family or within the same\nplant genus, at least eight shifts have occurred between hosts belonging\nto distantly related and chemically dissimilar plant families. In these\ncases, host shifts may have been simply directed toward plant species\navailable in the environment. Yet, given that two Gonioctena lineages\nhave independently colonized the same three new plant families,\nincluding four of the same new genera, some constraints are likely to\nhave limited the different possibilities of interfamilial host-plant\nshifts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3303.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3305.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3306.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3307.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3308.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonioctena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3309.phy"}]}
