Two coelomycetous taxa belonging\nto two different genera in Xylariomycetidae, Sordariomycetes, namely\nDiscosia and Sporocadus, were identified. Multi-locus phylogeny based on\nDNA sequence data of the large subunit (LSU) and internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes and β-tubulin (β-tub2)\nrevealed that the Discosia species was basal to D. neofraxinea and\nformed an independent lineage. The latter is also different from other\nDiscosia species by its unilocular to bilocular, superficial and\napplanate conidiomata along with elongate-ampulliform conidiogenous\ncells attenuated at the base, and conidia smaller in size. It is\nintroduced as Discosia ravennica sp. nov.. Morphological observations\ncoupled with multigene phylogeny identified our second taxon as\nSporocadus rosigena, which is herein described as a new record from\nItaly. Descriptions, illustrations and molecular data for both species\nare provided in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128509.phy"}]}
