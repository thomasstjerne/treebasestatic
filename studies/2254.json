Morphological observation revealed that the fungus\nbelongs to Oidium subgenus Reticuloidium, anamorph of the genus\nGolovinomyces. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide\nsequences of the rDNA ITS regions and D1/D2 domains of the 28S rDNA\nindicated that the fungus belongs to the clade of G. orontii with other\nGolovinomyces fungi from a wide range of host plants, suggesting that\nthe fungus was newly transported from abroad. Because there has been no\nprior report of cucumber powdery mildew caused by Reticuloidium, further\nresearch on the physiology, epidemiology, control and resistant cucumber\nvarieties is required.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Golovinomyces 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3222.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Golovinomyces ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3221.phy"}]}
