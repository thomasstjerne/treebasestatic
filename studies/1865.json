Because the family possesses\nplesiomorphic and generalized traits that occur throughout the order,\nthis diverse assemblage of hemiparasitic plants has been difficult to\ncharacterize and differentiate from related families. We present\nphylogenetic analyses of all genera of Santalaceae, as well as Viscaceae\nand selected Opiliaceae, using DNA sequences from nuclear small-subunit\nribosomal DNA as well as the chloroplast genes matK and rbcL. The\nconcatenated data set, analyzed with parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian\ninference gave congruent results, with the majority of clades fully\nresolved. Our results reveal that the family is polyphyletic and that\nthe genera of Santalaceae, as traditionally classified, occur in nine\nwell-supported clades. The South American herbaceous perennial genera\nArjona and Quinchamalium are sister to Schoepfia (Schoepfiaceae). The\nAustralian genus Anthobolus emerges as a member of Opiliaceae. The\nremaining genera included in Santalaceae occur in six well-supported\nclades, however, the relationships among these clades are not fully\nresolved. These clades are (based on a component generic name),\nCervantesia, Thesium, Nanodea, Santalum, Amphorogyne, and Viscum.\nMorphological features diagnostic of these clades are discussed with the\nintention that these results will serve as the foundation for a revised\nclassification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Nuclear SSU MP strict con","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, nuSSU MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1010.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear SSU ML","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, nuSSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1011.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear SSU BI maj rule con","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, nuSSU BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1012.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL MP strict con","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, rbcL MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1013.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL ML","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, rbcL ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1014.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL BI maj rule con","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, rbcL BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1015.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK MP strict con","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, matK MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1016.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK ML","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, matK ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1017.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK BI maj rule con","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, matK BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1018.phy"},{"tree_label":"Three gene MP strict con","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, 3-gene MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1019.phy"},{"tree_label":"Three gene ML","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, 3-gene ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1020.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Santalaceae, 3-gene BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1021.phy"}]}
