The criteria of species level identification are\ndifficult due to insufficient ex-type cultures with molecular data and\nphylogenetic understanding. Two fungal specimens were collected from\nPicea crassifolia associated with symptomatic canker and dieback disease\nin the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. They were identified as\nnovel species based on morphology plus support from multilocus\nphylogenetic analyses of ITS, LSU, ACT, RPB2 and TEF1-Î± gene regions.\nCytospora piceae is characterized by its ostiolated pycnidia with\nvesicularly arranged locules, and hyaline, eguttulate, aseptate,\nallantoid conidia, which differs from similar species in its host\nassociation and multilocus phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114644.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114645.phy"}]}
