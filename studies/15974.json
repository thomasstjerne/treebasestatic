Since LMoV and LSV have\nbeen recently reported in Brazil, we detected the spreading of these\nviruses in 12 cultivation areas using simplex and multiplex RT-PCR with\nspecific primers designed for the respective coat protein (CP) genes\namplification. Eight fragments with 800 nt length obtained from the\nLMoV-infected and nine with 600 nt from LSV- infected lilies were\nsequenced. Phylogenetic analysis using the CP sequences clustered two\nBrazilian LMoV isolates in the same subtree with Tulip breaking\nvirus-lily strain (sin. LMoV) and Tulip band breaking virus, both from\nJapan. The other six LMoV Brazilian isolates share a common ancestor\nwith isolates from different countries. LSV isolates from Brazil\nclustered with isolates from Asia and The Netherlands, sharing a common\nancestor. Recombination detection analysis with partial CP sequences\nfrom both viruses revealed a LMoV recombinant isolate\n(S44147-Netherlands) whereas none event was supported for recombination\namong LSV isolates. To our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst report on\nevidence of recombination between LMoV isolates and of a proposal for\nits classification into groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75597.phy"}]}
