Identification and control of the\npathogens are difficult due to lacking of attention to branch canker,\ninsufficient phylogenetic un-derstanding and overlapped morphological\ncharacteristics. In the present study, 51 strains were isolated from\nChinese wild hazelnut and identified as five specie of Cytospora and\nDiaporthe through morphological observation and multi-locus phylogeny\nanalysis of ITS, act, cal, his3, rpb2, tef1α and tub2. These including\nthree new species Cytospora curviporus, C. corylina, Diaporthe\ncory-licola and two known taxa Cytospora leucostoma and Diaporthe eres.\nWe clarified that the current five species could grow at a temperature\nrange 530°C and the pH values 3.011.0, with optimum growth around 25°C\nand pH 4.07.0. In addition, effects of six carbon sources to mycelial\ngrowth also has been tested. The results represent a systematical study\nand a vital understanding and explain the wide occurrence of the canker\ndisease of hazelnut in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"290","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132738.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"238","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132739.phy"}]}
