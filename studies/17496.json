{"Authors":" Isabelle M Vea, David Grimaldi","Year":" 2016","Title":" Putting scales into evolutionary time: the divergence of\nmajor scale insect lineages (Hemiptera) predates the radiation of modern\nangiosperm hosts","Journal":" Scientific Reports","Volume":" 6","Issue":"","Pages":" 23487","Keywords":" phytophagy, amber, fossils, total evidence","DOI":" 10.1038/srep23487","Abstract":" The radiation of flowering plants in the mid-Cretaceous\ntransformed landscapes and is widely believed to have fuelled the\nradiations of major groups of phytophagous insects. An excellent group\nto test this assertion is the scale insects (Coccomorpha: Hemiptera),\nwith some 8,000 described Recent species and probably the most diverse\nfossil record of any phytophagous insect group preserved in amber. We\nused here a total-evidence approach (by tip-dating) employing 174\nmorphological characters of 73 Recent and 43 fossil taxa (48 families)\nand DNA sequences of three gene regions, to obtain divergence time\nestimates and compare the chronology of the most diverse lineage of\nscale insects, the neococcoid families, with the timing of the main\nangiosperm radiation. An estimated origin of the Coccomorpha occurred at\nthe beginning of the Triassic, about 245 Ma [228-273], and of the\nneococcoids 60 million years later [210-165 Ma]. A total-evidence\napproach allows the integration of extinct scale insects into a\nphylogenetic framework, resulting in slightly younger median estimates\nthan analyses using Recent taxa, calibrated with fossil ages only. From\nthese estimates, we hypothesize that most major lineages of coccoids\nshifted from gymnosperms onto angiosperms when the latter became diverse\nand abundant in the mid- to Late Cretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-E","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95413.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-B","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95412.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-F","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95411.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-E","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95410.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-I","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95409.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-G","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig, 3","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95407.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-C","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95406.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-H","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95405.phy"},{"tree_label":"TD-D","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95404.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-A-lognormal","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95426.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-I","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95425.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-D","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95424.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-nonclock","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95422.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-H","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95421.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-G","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95420.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-C","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95419.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-strictclock","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95427.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-B","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95418.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-J","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95417.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-K","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95416.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-F","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95415.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMS-ND-A-noroot","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95414.phy"}]}
