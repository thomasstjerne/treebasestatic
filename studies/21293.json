In the present\nstudy, we sequenced the chloroplast genome of U. flexuosa followed by\nannotation and comparative analysis. It indicated that the chloroplast\ngenomes had high conservation among Ulva spp., and high rearrangement\noutside them. Though U. flexuosa was closer to U. linza than U. fasciata\nin phylogenetic tree, the average Ka/Ks between U. flexuosa and U. linza\nassessed by 67 protein-coding genes was higher than those between U.\nflexuosa and other species in Ulva spp., due to the variation of psbZ,\npsbM and ycf20. Our results laid the foundation for the future studies\non the evolution of chloroplast genomes of Ulva, as well as the\nmolecular identification of U. flexuosa varieties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ulva flexuosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109575.phy"}]}
