Nonetheless, its causes are poorly understood. For animals,\ngeneration time is frequently cited because longer-lived species tend to\nhave slower rates of molecular evolution than their shorter-lived\ncounterparts. Although a similar pattern has been uncovered in flowering\nplants, using proxies such as growth form, the underlying process has\nremained elusive. Here we find a deceleration of molecular evolutionary\nrate to be coupled with the origin of arborescence in ferns.\nPhylogenetic branch lengths within the “tree fern” clade are\nconsiderably shorter than those of closely related lineages, and our\nanalyses demonstrate that this is due to a significant difference in\nmolecular evolutionary rate. Reconstructions reveal that the most abrupt\nrate deceleration coincided with the evolution of the long-lived\ntree-like habit at the base of the tree fern clade. This suggests that a\ngeneration time effect may well be ubiquitous across the green tree of\nlife, and that the search for a responsible mechanism must focus on\ncharacteristics shared by all vascular plants. Discriminating among the\npossibilities will require contributions from various biological\ndisciplines, but will be necessary for a full appreciation of molecular\nevolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tree Ferns and Outgroups","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6943.phy"}]}
