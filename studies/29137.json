{"Authors":" NA","Year":" 2021","Title":" Disentangling a 40-year-old taxonomic puzzle: phylogenetic\nposition of Mimulicalyx (Lamiales)","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Lamiales  molecular systematics  Phrymaceae  Plastome \nScrophulariaceae","DOI":"","Abstract":" With the disintegration of the traditionally circumscribed\nScrophulariaceae, the phylogenetic placement of most genera formerly\nplaced within that family were resolved. However, the familial placement\nof the monotypic genus Mimulicalyx has not been included in any\npublished molecular phylogenetic studies. In the present study we adopt\na two-step approach to resolve the phylogenetic placement of Mimulicalyx\nusing three datasets: (1) a 71,619 bp plastome alignment of Lamiales;\n(2) a dataset of six chloroplast DNA regions (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL,\nrps16, and trnL-trnF) for Phrymaceae, and (3) a dataset of the nuclear\nribosomal internal and external transcribed spacer regions (nrITS, ETS)\nfor Phrymaceae. Our analyses reveal that Mimulycalyx is a member of the\ntribe Mimuleae within Phrymaceae. Generic level phylogenetic\nrelationships within Phrymaceae are further discussed, and a dichotomous\nkey to the 14 genera currently recognized is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134784.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134785.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134786.phy"}]}
