Frequent\npoints of mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene region,\nresult in the emergence of new IBVs variants circulating in the form of\nseveral serotypes/genotypes that can be partially or poorly neutralized\nby current vaccines. IBV is well studied worldwide, nevertheless in\nAfrican countries epidemiological and scientific data are poor and not\nupdated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infectious bronchitis virus IBV Hvr 1 and 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101543.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infectious bronchitis virus IBV Hvr 1 and 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101542.phy"}]}
