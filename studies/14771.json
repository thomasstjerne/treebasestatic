GenBank was explored for nine markers that are commonly used in\nvarious molecular and phylogenetic studies of flesh flies. We obtained\ndata for 187 species and constructed an aligned dataset with 9241\ncharacters. However, the matrix suffered from 74% missing data due to a\nlow number of sequences for some markers and in most of the cases only\nshort fragments of the analysed genes were available. The reconstructed\ntree was taxonomically biased towards the subfamilies Paramacronychiinae\n(12% of the described species) and Sarcophaginae (8.6% of the described\nspecies) and specifically the genus Sarcophaga. The third subfamily\nMiltogramminae was represented by only 0.7% of described species.\nMoreover, about half of the included species were of forensic\nimportance, while the percentage of such species in the entire family\nwas estimated at 7%. Many nodes had very low support, so in order to\nincrease the support and thereby identify a âcore topologyâ, we pruned\nârogueâ taxa and applied different substitution models. Both strategies\nimproved support considerably, although some nodes still were left\nunresolved. An analysis of the distribution of bootstrap values across\nchronograms showed that the weakest phylogenetic signal is restricted to\nthat part of the tree which coincides with the onset of rapid radiations\nmainly within the genus Sarcophaga. Our study is concordant with\nphylogenies obtained by other authors, with the most noteworthy\nexception being the subfamily Paramacronychiinae emerging as\nparaphyletic with regard to the Miltogramminae, which is in strong\nconflict with morphological evidence. We discuss the new findings in the\nlight of traditional taxonomical classifications of Sarcophagidae and\nrecent molecular studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae no rogues no partition 164","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68856.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae Mitochondrial nuclear 194","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae RNA proteins 194","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68858.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae mrbayes 194","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68859.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae no partition 194","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68860.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae no rogues RNA proteins 164","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68855.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0www","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarcophagidae no rogues mitochondrial nuclear 164","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68854.phy"}]}
