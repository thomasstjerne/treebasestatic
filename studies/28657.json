The four species described by Imai as Hebeloma (H.\nfimicola, H. helvolescens, H. humosum, and H. tomoeae) are not from the\ngenus Hebeloma, but are members of Agrocybe, Homophron, or Pholiota.\nRecombinations are made. Hebeloma crustuliniforme f. microspermum,\ndescribed by Hongo, is a synonym of H. nanum. Three species of Hebeloma\nare described as new to science, all currently known only from Japan.\nTwo of these species, H. asperosporum and H. cinnamomeum, are members of\nH. sect. Denudata while the third species H. citrisporum belongs to H.\nsect. Velutipes. Japanese records of H. cavipes, H. eburneum, H.\nhygrophilum, H. subtortum, and H. velutipes are validated. In total,\nfifteen species of Hebeloma are confirmed from Japan; this is compared\nwith previous checklists.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132855","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132855.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132888","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132891.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132859.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132890.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132892.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132893.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132894.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132895.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132896.phy"}]}
