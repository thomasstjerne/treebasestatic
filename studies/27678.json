The whole plstome contains 164,293 bp, including a large\nsingle copy region (90,089 bp) and a small single copy region (24,871\nbp), which were separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions (24 881\nbp of IRB and 24 982 bp of IRA). Totally, 130 genes were identified,\ncontaining 86 coding-protein, 8 rRNA (4 rRNA species), and 36 tRNA\ngenes. Phylogenetic analysis based on common protein coding genes of 10\nAraceae species showed that P. peltata is original than other species in\nthe genus Pinellia. The whole plastome of P. peltata and other species\nshould facilitate further works for the genus Pinellia about genetic\ndiversity, phylogenetic analysis, and so on.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The phylogenetic tree of P. peltata and other\nspecies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128767.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The phylogenetic tree of P. peltata and other\nspecies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128768.phy"}]}
