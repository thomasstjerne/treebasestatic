In the phylogenetic analyses (ITS+LSU) C.\ngandariana appears as sister to the type species of the genus, C.\ntaxophila. The new species differs from C. taxophila by longer,\nellipsoid to subcylindrical basidiospores, often with a median\nconstriction; growth on piles of wood and leaves of Salix atrocinerea;\nand different ITS and LSU sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses support\nthe rather isolated position of both species of Clavicorona in relation\nto the other phylogenetic lineages in the family Clavariaceae","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134429.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU Bayesian Tree","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134432","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134432.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134430","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134430.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML LSU tree","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134431","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134431.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML ITS","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134433","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134433.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Bayes","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134434","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134434.phy"}]}
