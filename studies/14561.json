(Malvaceae: Bombacoideae) is distributed\npredominantly in northern South America and is the largest genus in the\nsubfamily, including ca. 50 species. Ongoing studies of the systematics\nof neotropical Bombacoideae and field work in northeastern Brazil led to\nthe discovery of a new species, herein described and illustrated.\nPachira moreirae Carv.-Sobr. & W. S. Alverson is known from a single\npopulation that is endemic to caatinga vegetation (a type of seasonally\ndry tropical forest) in the state of Bahia. The new species is leafless\nduring its flowering period, a condition commonly seen in some genera of\nBombacoideae but rare in Pachira, a genus that mostly comprises\nevergreen species. We provide a description of the morphology of this\nnew species and notes on its distribution, phenology, and conservation\nstatus. A phylogenetic analysis using ITS data shows that P. moreirae is\na member of a Brazilian extra-Amazonian clade of Pachira that also\nincludes P. glabra and P. retusa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66323.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66322.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65709","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65709.phy"}]}
