Only one speciation event is associated with vicariance due to\nPleistocene sea-level fluctuation, and a Pleistocene diversification\nmodel in which isolation is driven by sea-level changes is inconsistent\nwith the data. Tectonic vicariance is nearly absent from the\nPhilippines, in which tectonic coalescence plays a significant role.\nMost speciation events (about two-thirds) are associated with dispersal\nto newly developed oceanic islands. The data imply that the species have\npersisted for long periods, measured in millions of years after their\norigins; further implications therefore are that faunal turnover is very\nslow; and persistence over geological time spans is more prominent than\nrepeated colonization and extinction. Neither the equilibrium nor the\nvicariance model of biogeography adequately encompasses these results; a\nmodel incorporating colonization, extinction, and speciation is\nnecessary and must incorporate long-term persistence to accommodate our\nobservations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4235.phy"}]}
