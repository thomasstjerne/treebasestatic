Character state polarity is based on outgroup analysis of\nAndropogon sect. Leptopogon, to which the virginicus complex belongs. A\npreviously undetected synapomorphy justifies monophyly of this section.\nThe data used in the reconstructions contain extensive homoplasy, and\ntree topology changes considerably with minor changes in the data.\nNevertheless, the interrelationships of the taxa on the most\nparsimonious trees are largely concordant with the results of previous\nstudies. These cladistic analyses do, however, suggest different\nevolutionary relationships for the subspecific taxa of A. virginicus and\nA. glomeratus, the two most complex species. As a consequence of these\nanalyses, two new varieties, A. virginicus var. decipiens and A.\nglomeratus var. scabriglumus, are described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4291.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4292.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4293.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4294.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4295.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4296.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4297.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4C","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4D","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andropogoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4299.phy"}]}
