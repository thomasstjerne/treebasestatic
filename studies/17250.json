C.A.Paris. The latter species, together with the\nallopolyploid A. viridimontanum C.A.Paris, is known from serpentine in\nNew England and Canada. A phylogenetic analysis based on two plastid\nmarkers showed that the Pennsylvania and Maryland populations are A.\npedatum sensu stricto rather than A. aleuticum or A.\nviridimontanum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptic Adiantum Population Second MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93877.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptic Adiantum Population First MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93876.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP Bootstrap","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap Consensus Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93878.phy"}]}
