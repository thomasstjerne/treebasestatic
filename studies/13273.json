The\ncombined results of cladistic analyses suggest that the type material,\nan incomplete postcranial skeleton in two pieces (SMNS 12591), is from a\ntheropod close to Segisaurus and Coelophysis. An isolated manus (SMNS\n12352a) is definitely not theropodan, but could be from any small basal\narchosaur. The remarkable diversity of the carnivorous guild that\ndwelled in southern Germany before the end-Triassic events is\nunderlined.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6D","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56099.phy"}]}
