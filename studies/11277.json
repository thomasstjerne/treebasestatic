Traditionally, two sections (T. sect.\nEbracteolatae and sect. Bracteolatae) have been recognized within the\ngenus based on the presence or absence of bracteoles in the female\nflowers. The aims of this study were to reconstruct the phylogeny of\nTypha using DNA sequence data from nuclear LEAFY and three plastid\nregions, and to evaluate previous classifications. We sampled nine\nspecies from various regions that were each invariant at the molecular\nlevel. A parsimony consensus tree recognized three clades in the genus:\nclade I including T. angustifolia, T. elephantina, T. domingensis, and\nT. capensis; clade II including T. orientalis and T. laxmanni; and clade\nIII comprising T. latifolia and T. shuttleworthii. Typha minima was\nfound sister to the rest of the Typha species with maximal bootstrap\nsupport. The results do not support the previous classifications of\nTypha. Character analysis showed that bracteole loss, spatulate stigma,\nlack of a gap between staminate and pistillate inflorescences, and monad\npollen are derived characteristics in Typha.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59116.phy"}]}
