A megablast search of the NCBIs GenBank nucleotide\nsequence database using the ITS sequence of P. malaysiana retrieved as\nclosest hit an unclassified Pleosporaceae sp. (GenBank HM992501;\nIdentities = 538/540 (99%), Gaps = 0/540 (0%)). A phylogenetic tree\nconstructed using rDNA ITS sequences placed P. malaysiana in a clade\nwith Arthopyreniceae and Massariaceae members1; while a tree with rDNA\nLSU sequences confirmed the placement of P. malaysiana near\nArthopyreniceae and Massariaceae, with 98.8% similarity to Arthopyrenia\nsalicis (AY607730 2 &AY538339 3).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58605.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58606.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58607.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58608.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58609.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58610.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58611.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58612.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58613.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58614","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58614.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58615","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58615.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58616","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58616.phy"}]}
