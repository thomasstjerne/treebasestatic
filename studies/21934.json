Here, we provide molecular data for the link between sexual\nand asexual states of the fungus and elucidate the phylogeny of A.\nguaranitica. The multilocus phylogenetic analyses employed sequences\nfrom the 18S subunit (18S), 28S subunit (28S), and nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) of the nuc rDNA,\nsecond-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and translation\nelongation factor 1-Î± (TEF1) genetic loci. Estimates of the divergence\ntime of this lineage were supported by fossil calibration (FC) and\nsecondary calibration (SC) strategies. Our results indicate a natural\nplacement of Apiosphaeria within Diaporthaceae (Diaporthales), where it\nrepresents an ancient lineage of the crown group of Diaporthaceae,\ndiverging during the late Paleocene at 61.15 (FC) and 60.63 (SC) million\nyears ago. This divergence time estimate within Diaporthales is based on\nSpataporthe taylori, a diaporthaceous fossil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"sordariomycetes phylogram BI","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes phylogram LSU and RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114304.phy"},{"tree_label":"diaporthales chronogram uniform","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales chronogram LSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, RPB2 and\nTEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114306.phy"},{"tree_label":"diaporthales chronogram gamma","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales chronogram LSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, RPB2 and\nTEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114305.phy"},{"tree_label":"diaporthaceae phylogram BI","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthaceae phylogram LSU, ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114303.phy"},{"tree_label":"diaporthales phylogram BI","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales phylogram LSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, RPB2 and\nTEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114308.phy"}]}
