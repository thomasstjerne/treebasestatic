This study clarified\nthat P. protrusa is morphologically different from P. nervicola in\nfollowing points: (1) the ectal excipulum is more protruded toward the\nmargin, (2) the ascospores tend to be smaller, (3) the asci is\nrelatively longer and thinner, (4) the mycelium in cultivated colony is\ncomposed of chlamydospore-like brown hyphae (while those of P. nervicola\nform more complex structure, brown bulbil). The two species also do not\nshare the same hosts, and their sequences formed two independent clades\nin the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that P. protrusa and P. nervicola\nare distinct also from the viewpoints of ecology and phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114175","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114175.phy"}]}
