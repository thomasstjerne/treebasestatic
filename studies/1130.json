An allied species, Stenomesson chloranthum, is described from\nthe Departments of Amazonas and Cajamarca in Peru, but at lower\nelevation. Both of these species release their pollen in tetrads, unique\nwithin Amaryllidaceae, and have tri-lobed stigmas, unique within\nStenomesson.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andean Amaryllidaceae-atpB-rbcL spacer","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andean Amaryllidaceae-atpB-rbcL spacer with gap\nmatrix","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andean Amaryllidaceae-both genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4365.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Andean Amaryllidaceae-ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4366.phy"}]}
