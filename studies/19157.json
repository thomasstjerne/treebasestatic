Sphaerotheca is a group of powdery\nmildews mainly infecting herbaceous plants. In tropical countries such\nas Thailand, asexual morph of Podosphaera is more commonly found than\nsexual morph. Therefore, studies on diversity and molecular\nphylogenetics of powdery mildews in Thailand are important. In this\nstudy, morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses based on ITS\nsequence of the Podosphaera from Thailand were carried out. We reported\nnine plant species as new host records of powdery mildew in the world,\nviz.Â Cyanthillium cinereum and Spilanthes iabadicensis (Asteraceae),\nJusticia comata (Acanthaceae), Millingtonia hortensis (Bignoniaceae),\nPouzolzia zeylanica (Urticaceae), Hydrocleys nymphoides (Alismataceae),\nRaphistemma pulchellum, Gymnema inodorum (Apocynaceae) and Leucas\ndecemdentata (Lamiaceae). In addition, 22 new records of Podosphaera\nfound in Thailand. Phylogenetic affinity of Podosphaera species found in\nThailand and related species from other regions is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podospheara","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107783.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podospheara","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107784.phy"}]}
