The results are\nillustrated with two cladograms and indicate that Anigozanthos together\nwith Macropidia form a monophyletic group diagnosed by a string of\nsynapomorphies, with Macropidia fuliginosa being a derived relative of\nthe species of Anigozanthos subgenus Anigozanthos. Consequently,\nMacropidia fuliginosa is here treated as a section Macropidia of\nAnigozanthos.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haemodoraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1579.phy"}]}
