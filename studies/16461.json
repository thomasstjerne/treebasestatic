Here, we investigated the\ndiscriminatory power of four putative DNA barcoding loci (ITS,\ntrnH-psbA, matK, and rbcL) and corresponding multi-locus combinations\nfor 135 individuals from 33 species of Schisandraceae, using distance-,\ntree-, similarity-, and character-based methods. Our results showed that\nthe plastid trnH-psbA intergenic spacer and nuclear ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region possess higher species resolving power\nthan the other two chloroplast genes, matK and rbcL. The degree of\nspecies resolution greatly increased with multi-locus combinations,\nespecially ITS+matK and ITS+trnH-psbA+matK. We propose the combination\nof ITS and matK as the most ideal barcode for discriminating the\nmedicinal plants of Schisandraceae. The individuals of closely related\nspecies Schisandra rubriflora and Schisandra grandiflora always\nintertwined with each other on phylogenetic trees, which indicated that\nthe species boundary between these two species is indistinct.\nFurthermore, the samples of these two species from the southern Hengduan\nMountains region formed a distinct cluster that was separated from the\nsamples of other sampling regions, implying the presence of cryptic\ndiversity. The feasibility of DNA barcodes for identification of\ngeographical authenticity was also verified here. The database and\nparadigm that we provided in this study could be used as reference for\nthe authentication of traditional Chinese medicinal plants utilizing DNA\nbarcoding.","trees":[{"tree_label":"trnH-psbA+matK
