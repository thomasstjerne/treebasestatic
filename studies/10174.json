The present study\nrepresents the second contribution in a series describing several novel\nspecies in different capnodealean genera defined in a previous study.\nNovelties on Eucalyptus from Australia include: Penidiella\npseudotasmaniensis, P. tenuiramis, Phaeothecoidea intermedia, P.\nminutispora, Pseudocercospora tereticornis, Readeriella angustia, R.\neucalyptigena, R. menaiensis, R. pseudocallista, R. tasmanica,\nTeratosphaeria alboconidia, T. complicata, T. majorizuluensis, T.\nminiata, T. profusa, Zasmidium aerohyalinosporum and Z. nabiacense,\nwhile Teratosphaeria xenocryptica is described on Eucalyptus from Chile.\nNovelties on other hosts include Phaeophleospora eugeniicola on Eugenia\nfrom Brazil, and Zasmidium nocoxi on twig litter from the USA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"179","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeria, 1 of 1000 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6653.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, 1 of 1000 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6233.phy"}]}
