The disease affects human, domestic animals\nand wildlife. However, leptospirosis is challenging in its diagnosis in\nhumans. Culture technique, which is time consuming, is not recommended\nfor clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in humans. For these reasons,\nserological and molecular techniques remain the test of choice. The\nmajor objective of this study was to explore the genetic characteristic\nof Leptospira species which are prevalent among agro-pastoralists living\nin KataviÂ–Rukwa Ecosystem, Tanzania.","trees":[{"tree_label":"new","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95612.phy"}]}
