The 28S rDNA,\ntef1 and rpb2 loci significantly supported the monophyletic status of\nseveral distinct genera of hypogeous Pyronemataceae. The genetic\nidentity of Genabea fragilis is established, and the new species Genabea\nhyalospora, G. urbana, Myrmecocystis mediterranea and M. microspora are\nproposed to accommodate undescribed lineages. Two rare species, M.\nsphaerospora and M. spinospora, are here tentatively identified based on\ncollections that are morphologically similar to the original\ndescriptions. The genus Genea was found to be monophyletic, except for\nG. cazaresii, which is nested among epigeous species of Humaria. The new\ncombination Humaria cazaresii is proposed to accommodate this\nspecies","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr108696","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108696.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr108698","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108698.phy"}]}
