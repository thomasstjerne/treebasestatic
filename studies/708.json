The isolates fall into two pheromone response categories.\nOne of these includes isolates of widespread distribution in the United\nStates, and all appear to be capable of forming zygotes inter se. The\nsecond group is larger and more complex, encompassing four mating groups\nas defined by zygote formation. Comparison of DNA sequences (internal\ntranscribed spacers 1 and 2 of the nuclear rDNA repeats) fully supports\nthe same subdivision of the isolates. Both selfing and outbreeding\nclones were among the isolates. The possibility that other Volvocales\nspecies might respond to these same pheromones remains to be\ntested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlamydomonas allensworthii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5545.phy"}]}
