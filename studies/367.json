Two species of Alloplectus were\nincluded in the analyses and one of Drymonia was used as the outgroup.\nRestriction site variation was analyzed using Wagner parsimony and\ncharacter state weighting that favors convergent losses over convergent\ngains. The large numbers of equally most parsimonious trees prevented\nexamination of each tree independently. Thus, examination of\nphylogenetic relationships was based on a strict consensus of all most\nparsimonious trees. The resulting phylogeny is largely congruent with\nrecent classification schemes, although the positions of several species\nare not in accordance with traditional relationships. As a result of the\ncladistic analysis of the cpDNA restriction site variation, section\nPentadenia is at least paraphyletic, and possibly polyphyletic with\nsection Stygnanthe. The lack of resolution among the several clades\nwithin section Stygnanthe does not provide evidence for or against\nmonophyly of this section. Several clades are strongly supported with\ncpDNA data and provide insight into biogeography and origin of\nmorphological adaptations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Columnea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3252.phy"}]}
