It comprises several economically or medicinally important\ngenera including Cuminum, Daucus, Laser, Laserpitium and Thapsia among\nothers. Recent molecular studies, based mostly on nrDNA ITS sequences,\nrevealed that neither Daucus nor Laserpitium are monophyletic. To\naddress issues of relationships and apply respective nomenclatural\nchanges, we obtained additional ITS sequences as well as independent\ndata from three plastid markersrps16 intron, rpoC1 intron and rpoB-trnC\nintergenic spacerfor a comprehensive sample of the subtribe. We examined\ndata for 260 accessions representing all genera of Daucinae and 81 of\nits ca. 93 species. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The results indicate that\nformer Laserpitieae constitute a paraphyletic grade at the base of the\nspiny-fruited members of Daucinae while traditionally delimited Daucus\nand Laserpitium are polyphyletic. To maintain a monophyletic Daucus, we\nsuggest including the following genera and species into its synonymy:\nAgrocharis, Melanoselinum, Monizia, Pachyctenium, Pseudorlaya, Rouya,\nTornabenea, Athamanta dellacellae and Cryptotaenia elegans. The species\nof Laserpitium occur in seven clades and only six species of the\nLaserpitium s.str. clade retain the generic name. Several species are\ntransferred to Ekimia, Laser and Thapsia; additionally, a monospecific\ngenus Siler is restored and a new genus, Silphiodaucus, is established.\nThe inclusion of Ammodaucus into Thapsia suggested in an earlier study\nis not supported. The position of Laserpitium pseudomeum requires\nfurther study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"no rpoB MB","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93891","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93891.phy"},{"tree_label":"no rpoB ML","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93892","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93892.phy"},{"tree_label":"All 13 ML","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93882","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93882.phy"},{"tree_label":"All MB","ntax":"241","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93883","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93883.phy"},{"tree_label":"All ML","ntax":"241","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93884","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93884.phy"},{"tree_label":"All 13 MB","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apiaceae subtribe Daucinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93881.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA MB","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93885","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93885.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA ML","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93886","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93886.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MB","ntax":"212","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93887","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93887.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS short ML","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93889","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93889.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS short MB","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apiaceae subtribe Daucinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93888.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML","ntax":"212","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93890","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93890.phy"}]}
