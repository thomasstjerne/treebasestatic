Molecular data corroborate the deep separation\nbetween the complex thalloid and leafy/simple thalloid liverworts\nimplied by morphological data, but the monophyly of liverworts could not\nbe rejected. The effects of accounting for site-to-site rate\nheterogeneity in these data were examined using maximum likelihood\nmethods. Comparison of trees obtained with and without rate\nheterogeneity showed that simply allowing for heterogeneity had a\ngreater improvement on likelihood score than optimization of\ntransition/transversion bias. Incorporation of site-to-site rate\nheterogeneity in the larger analysis, however, did not necessarily\nchange which topology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hepaticae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1344.phy"}]}
