The combinability of these data partitions was\nassessed in several ways: measures of phylogenetic signal, character\nsupport for trees, congruence of tree topologies, compatibility of data\npartitions with suboptimal trees, and homogeneity of data partitions.\nCombined parsimony analysis of all data equally weighted yielded the\nsame tree as the 12S partition analyzed under parsimony and maximum\nlikelihood. The COI, allozyme, and morphology partitions were generally\ncongruent and compatible with the tree derived from combined data. The\ncall data were significantly different from all other partitions,\nwhether considered in terms of tree topology alone, partition\nhomogeneity, or compatibility of data with trees derived from other\npartitions. The lack of effect of the call data on the topology of the\ncombined tree is probably due to the small number of call characters.\nThe general incongruence of the call data with other data partitions is\nconsistent with the idea that the advertisement calls of this group of\nfrogs are under strong sexual selection.
