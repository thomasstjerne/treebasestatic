One lineage contains the genera Lentinula, Rhodocollybia,\nTetrapyrgos, a resurrected and redefined Mycetinis, and two unresolved\nclades designated /marasmiellus and /gymnopus. /marasmiellus includes\nthe type species of Marasmiellus and is dominated by members of Gymnopus\nsect. Vestipedes. /gymnopus includes the type species of Gymnopus,\nMicromphale and Setulipes, and members of Gymnopus sect. Levipedes. A\nsecond lineage includes the genera Marasmius s.s., Crinipellis and\nChaetocalathus (separate study) and represents a redefined\n/marasmiaceae. A third lineage includes the genera Cylindrobasidium,\nFlammulina, Gloiocephala, Physalacria, Strobilurus, Xerula and Marasmius\nsect. Epiphylli, and represents /physalacriaceae. One new combination in\nRhodocollybia and four new combinations in Mycetinis are proposed. A\ndiscussion of the taxonomic implications resulting from the phylogenetic\nreconstruction is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopoid Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_482.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopoid Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4468.phy"}]}
