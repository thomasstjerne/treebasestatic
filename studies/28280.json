Five known species (T.\ncheejenii, T. fibulifera s.s., T. “neofibulifera”, T. lloydiae-candidae\nand T. olens) and four new species (T. australe, T. guangxiensis, T.\nlatispora and T. subfibulifera) in the complex are recognized based on\nmorphological characteristics, molecular evidence, and geographic\ndistribution. Sequences of eight species of the complex were included in\nthe phylogenetic analyses because T. olens lacks of molecular data. The\nphylogenetic analyses were performed by a combined sequence dataset of\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the partial nuclear large\nsubunit rDNA (nLSU), and a combined sequence dataset of the ITS, partial\nnLSU, the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the translation\nelongation factor 1-α (TEF1), the largest and second largest subunits of\nRNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2). The eight species formed eight\nindependent lineages with robust support in phylogenies based on both\ndatasets. Illustrated description of the six species including Tremella\nfibulifera s.s., T. “neofibulifera” and four new species, and\ndiscussions with their related species are provided. A table of the\ncomparison of the characteristics of nine species in the T. fibulifera\ncomplex is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tremella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134426.phy"}]}
