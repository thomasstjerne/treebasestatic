We used\nwhole-genome sequencing to solve the spatiotemporal origins of the most\ndevastating panzootic to date, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium\ndendrobatidis, a proximate driver of global amphibian declines. We\ntraced the source of B. dendrobatidis to the Korean peninsula, where one\nlineage, BdASIA-1, exhibits the genetic hallmarks of an ancestral\npopulation that seeded the panzootic. We date the emergence of this\npathogen to the early 20th century, coinciding with the global expansion\nof commercial trade in amphibians, and we show that intercontinental\ntransmission is ongoing. Our findings point to East Asia as a geographic\nhotspot for B. dendrobatidis biodiversity and the original source of\nthese lineages that now parasitize amphibians worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"184","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytrid fungi mtDNA PhyML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111639.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"181","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytrid fungi MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytrid fungi RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111922.phy"}]}
