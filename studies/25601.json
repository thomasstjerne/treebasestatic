Basidiocarps of\nPhylloporia have been used as medicines in folklore mainly in Shandong\nProvince, China. However, although the species diversity of Phylloporia\nhas been extremely explored worldwide recently, the species identity of\nthe medicinal basidiocarps is still unconfirmed. In this study, we\nsampled basidiocarps of Phylloporia from the host genera recorded in\nmedicinal studies. On the basis of morphological and phylogenetic\nevidence, it is clarified that Phylloporia lonicerae is the most widely\nused medicinal species of this genus, P. fontanesiae is rarely used, and\nP. pulla is potentially used. The taxonomical status of these three\nspecies are briefly discussed, and P. lonicerae and P. pulla originally\ndescribed outside China are described with illustrations. This\nclarification is crucial for medicinal studies and potential industry\ndevelopment of this kind of fungal resources.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121445","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121445.phy"}]}
