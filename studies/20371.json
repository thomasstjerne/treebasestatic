Phylogenetic analyses identified four\nsubclades within L. pseudotheobromae sensu lato, which are corresponding\nto L. pseudotheobromae and L. chinensis, as well as other two reported\nspecies L. lignicola and L. The distinct phylogenetic position of these\nfour clades is supported by differences in conidial morphology and these\nare, therefore, described as Lasiodiplodia chineisis sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule of 16","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20371 22x1704 con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 23456 78x1957 con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103020.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 23456 78x1957 BS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103019.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20546 40x1892 BS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20546 40x1892 CON","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103081.phy"}]}
