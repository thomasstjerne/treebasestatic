The\nstrain, Y.lipolytica NCIM 3590 (Yl3590), isolated from Scottish sea\nwaters was reinvestigated for its phenotypic, molecular and genomic\nproperties as it exhibited characteristics unlike Y.lipolytica, namely,\ngrowth at low temperatures (10-20°C) and absence of extracellular\nlipolytic activity. Preliminary studies based on colony/cellular\nmorphology, effect of temperature/salt on growth, sugar assimilation and\nfermentation tests were inconclusive to ascertain the identity of the\nstrain. Hence, molecular identification was performed using ITS and\nD1/D2sequences and BLAST analysis suggested that Yl3590 is 100%\nidentical to Y.bubula NCAIM Y.01998 and Y.bubula CBS 12934. Phylogenetic\nanalysis with reference Yarrowia sequences reported in the NCBI database\nrevealed thatYl3590 clustered with Y.bubula under a separate node.\nAdditionally, to corroborate the results, whole genome sequencing using\nIIlumina NextSeq technology was performed and we report here the first\ndraft genome of this strain. The genomic relatedness ofYl3590 was\ndetermined with the available reference genome sequences of Y.bubula CBS\n12934 as well as Y.lipolytica CLIB 89 and CLIB122 using genome wide\nmetrics, digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide\nidentity (ANI). The values obtained for dDDH (94.1%), ANIb/ANIm\n(99.41/99.42%) and for Ortho ANI (99.47%) between Yl3590 and Y.bubula\nwere greater than for Y. lipolytica. These were above the acceptable\nthreshold values (dDDH ≥ 70%, ANI/orthoANI ≥ 95-96 %) for species\ndelineation, indicating that they belong to the same genomic species.\nHence, we suggest that Yl3590 could be reclassified as Yarrowia bubula\nNCIM 3590.","trees":[{"tree_label":"D1D2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Yarrowia lipolytica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Yarrowia lipolytica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117180.phy"}]}
