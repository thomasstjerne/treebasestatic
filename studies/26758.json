Two\nspecies, C. griseolilacina and C. sinensis were described as new\nspecies; both possess branched and pale purple-tinged fruit bodies.\nHowever, the former scarcely branched, while the latter is profusely\nbranched. The phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) sequences confirmed the distinctions between these two new\nspecies and their close relationships with C. rubicundula and C. fumosa\nin the genus. An evolutionary tendency in genus Clavaria was discussed.\nAdditionally, morphological features of the two new species were\ndescribed in detail and were illustrated with line drawings and\nphotographs. Holotypes of the new species are deposited in the\nMycological Herbarium of Hunan Normal University (MHHNU). The ITS\nsequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank. A key is\nprovided for the known Clavaria species in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131439.phy"}]}
