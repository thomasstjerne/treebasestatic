Despite their different origins, five of the\nseven isolates studied caused poor seedling establishment of rice in a\nlaboratory inoculation experiment. The species is characterized by\noogonia with smoothwalled or sometimes one projection, with one to two\nantheridia, and aplerotic oospores. Hyphal swellings were rarely\nobserved. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer\nregion of the ribosomal RNA gene and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase\nsubunit 1 and 2 genes confirmed that the species differed from other\nGlobisporangium species. This novel species is described and illustrated\nin detail.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97588","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97587","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97589","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97590","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97590.phy"}]}
