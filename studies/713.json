The molecular phylogeny supports the\nplacement of the genus Akera, a taxon previously regarded by some\nauthors as a cephalaspidean, within the Anaspidea. Incongruence between\nthe molecular data and the classifications based on morphology suggests\nthat some of the taxonomic characters (i.e., shell, parapodia fusion)\ntraditionally used for the classification of sea hares must be\nreevaluated, since they maybe homoplastic. The ancestral nature of\nNotarchus based on the molecular evidence suggests that homoplasy may be\nan explanation for the morphological resemblance of this species to the\nmore derived sea hares with highly fused parapodia and concentrated\nnerve ganglia. Finally, examples are given of how comparative studies of\nthe evolution of learning mechanisms in the anaspidean clade will\nbenefit from the phylogenetic hypothesis presented in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anaspidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3748.phy"}]}
