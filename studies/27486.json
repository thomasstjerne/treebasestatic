However, combining\nthe three approaches to address species distribution at a global scale\nand drivers that shape it remains a study field yet poorly developed. A\nthree steps process fully based on open-access data and open-source\nsoftware, mixing biostatistical (SDM and ecological closeness\ncalculation) and molecular approaches (divergence time estimation), was\ndeveloped to address common questions regarding saprotrophic fungi\ndistribution. The process is reported in this paper using Hexagonia\nhydnoides (Sw.) M. Fidalgo as a model species. This well-known polypore\nexhibits an unclear distribution pattern with some strongly disconnected\npopulations and has a well-documented dependence to host tree species,\nand available open-access molecular data. The ensemble SDM were\nperformed using two algorithms: Random Forest and MaxEnt. The ecological\ncloseness calculation was computed thanks to a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe divergence time estimation was based on a bayesian molecular clock\napproach using three molecular datasets: 28S, ITS1+5.8S+ITS2+LSU, and\nSSU+ITS1+5.8S+ITS2+LSU, and fossils calibration points. Divergence time\nestimations were consistent with previous works, notably for the most\nrecent taxa (Polyporales, Polyporaceae, and Trametes), which divergence\ntime was recently estimated with the whole genome. Results suggested\nthat H. hydnoides is a Neotropical species that have evolved rather\nrecently (30.37±2.29 million years ago) during the Eocene period. It\nseems to be no climatic nor edaphic limitation to its presence in the\nwhole pantropical area, suggesting that populations strongly\ndisconnected from its originating area (i.e. in Eastern Africa) are\ncertainly due to rare long-distance dispersal events and that this\nspecies has de facto limited long-distance dispersal abilities.","trees":[{"tree_label":"SSU-ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_PRANK_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128263","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128263.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_KALIGN_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128264","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128264.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU-ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_MUSCLE_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128265","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128265.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_MAFFT_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128266","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128266.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_KALIGN_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128267","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128267.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_CLUSTAL_OMEGA_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128253","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128253.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU-ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_CLUSTAL_OMEGA_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128254","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128254.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU-ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_KALIGN_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128255","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128255.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_MUSCLE_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128256","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128256.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU-ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_MAFFT_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128257","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128257.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_MAFFT_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128258","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128258.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1-58S-ITS2-LSU_PRANK_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128259","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128259.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_MUSCLE_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128260","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128260.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_PRANK_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128261","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128261.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_CLUSTAL_OMEGA_COMBINED_TREE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128262","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128262.phy"}]}
