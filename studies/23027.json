Glandular secretion\nwithin these structures serve as nuptial gifts, and thus sexual\nselection may have contributed to their high species richness. However,\nspecies diversity of dwarf spiders in East Asia is yet understudied.\nHere we describe 13 new species from Taiwan belonging to the erigonine\ngenus Shaanxinus Tanasevitch, 2006: S. magniclypeus sp. n. (♂♀), S.\nshihchoensis sp. n. (♂♀), S. shoukaensis sp. n. (♂♀), S. hirticephalus\nsp. n. (♂♀), S. mingchihensis sp. n. (♂♀), S. makauyensis sp. n. (♂♀),\nS. lixiangae sp. n. (♂♀), S. curviductus sp. n. (♂♀), S. tsou sp.\nn. (♂♀)S. hehuanensis sp. n. (♂♀), S. seediq sp. n. (♂♀), S.\nmeifengensis sp. n. (♂♀) and S. atayal sp. n. (♂♀). In addition, one new\nspecies from Vietnam, S. tamdaoensis sp. n. (♂) is described from museum\nmaterial. We reconstructed the dimension of glandular tissues associated\nwith male prosoma modifications in Shaanxinus, as well as the detailed\npalpal structure by micro-computer tomography. Placement within\nShaanxinus and intrageneric relationships were inferred by means of a\ncladistic analysis based on morphological characters. Sequences of COI,\n16S and 28S genetic markers corroborated the monophyly of some species,\nas well as male-female matching. poly-/paraphyly of morphologically\ndelimitated species in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) trees led to the\ndiscovery of two cryptic species, for which diagnostic morphological\ncharacters could then be identified. We discuss incomplete lineage\nsorting and introgression as possible causes of mtDNA poly-/paraphyly in\nmorphologically indistinguishable specimens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112797.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112798.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112795.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112796.phy"}]}
