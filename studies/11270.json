These analyses,\ncombined with our previous morphological information, revealed a\ndetailed diversification process of Platycerus in Japan, and estimates\nof their divergence times. Introgression of the COI gene was also\ndiscovered in some species. From this data, it was inferred that the\ngenetic divergence of Platycerus has occurred intensely in southwestern\nJapan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr29961","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_29961.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr29959","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_29959.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr29960","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_29960.phy"}]}
