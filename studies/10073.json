We used\ndifferences in the genitalia of the Cretan Xerocrassa species as\npotential indices of sexual selection. First, we rejected the hypothesis\nthat differences in the genitalia of the Xerocrassa species can be\nexplained by genetic drift using coalescent simulations based on a\nmitochondrial gene tree. Second, we showed that there is no evidence for\nthe hypothesis that the differences in the genitalia can be explained by\nnatural selection against hybrids under the assumption that this is more\nlikely in geographically overlapping species pairs and clades. Thus, the\ndifferences in the genitalia evolved probably as a result of sexual\nselection. Finally, we showed that the evolution of differences in the\nlength of the flagellum that forms the tail of the spermatophore is\nconcentrated towards the tips of the tree indicating that it is involved\nin speciation. The tail of the spermatophore enables the sperm to escape\nfrom the female gametolytic organ. Thus, the radiation might have been\ntriggered by sexual conflict or cryptic female choice. If speciation is\nfacilitated by sexual selection, niches may remain conserved and\nnon-adaptive radiation may result.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xerocrassa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6189.phy"}]}
