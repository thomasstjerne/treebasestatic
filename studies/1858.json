However, the phylogenetic placement\nof Monogramma and Rheopteris remain to be examined. The inclusion of\nRheopteris cheesmaniae (the sole representative of the genus) in the\nvittarioids has been questioned since its description half a century\nago, and although the placement of Monogramma within the vittarioids is\nwell supported with non-molecular characters, its relationship to other\nmembers of the vittarioid clade is unknown. We present new phylogenetic\nevidence from plastid rbcL sequence data indicating that Rheopteris is\nstrongly supported as a member of the vittarioid clade, and that\nMonogramma is polyphyletic. Data from molecular and non-molecular\ncharacters suggest that a clade containing Rheopteris and part of\nMonogramma, i.e., those species sometimes ascribed to the genus\nVaginularia, represent the earliest diverging lineage within the\nvittarioids, and that remaining members of Monogramma are derived from\nwithin Haplopteris.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rheopteris and the Polyphyly of Monogramma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_997.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rheopteris and the Polyphyly of Monogramma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_998.phy"}]}
