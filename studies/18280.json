{"Authors":" Eduardo Abreo","Year":" 2015","Title":" Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of potential\nbacterial entomopathogens isolated from grasshoppers species\n(Orthoptera: Acrididae)","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Bacillus","DOI":"","Abstract":" Of the bacteria pathogenic to insects, the spore-forming\nbacilli are viewed as having the highest potential for use in the\nmanagement of insect pest populations, and these organisms have received\nthe greatest commercial attention. On the other hand, B. thuringiensis\nrarely induces epizootics except in cases where insects are in confined\nor crowded areas such as bee hives, insect-rearing facilities, or stored\ngrain bins. This might account for the fact that of the few strains of\nBt selected with activity against grasshoppers, all have been isolated\nfrom soils and no attempt to isolate Bacillus thuringiensis from\ngrasshoppers has yet been published. Among the Enterobacteriaceae,\nSerratia spp. and Yersinia spp. have been used for the control of insect\npests. Similarly to Bacillus spp., there is no report of isolates of\nthese genera isolated from grasshoppers. A strain of Yersinia sp. named\nMH96 was obtained from soil in New Zealand and showed activity against\nthe first instar larva of L. migratoria. Although Serratia spp. have\nbeen isolated from grasshoppers, their pathogenicity has not been\nfurther studied.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93953","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93953.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93952","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93952.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93946","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93946.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93947","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93947.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93948","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93948.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93949","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93949.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93950","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93950.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93951","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93951.phy"},{"tree_label":"1 Most Pars Tree","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93954","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93954.phy"}]}
