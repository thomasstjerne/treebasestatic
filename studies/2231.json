They comprise two sister orders,\nthe Bryopsidales and Dasycladales. We infer the phylogenetic\nrelationships among the siphonous green algae based on a multi-locus\ndata matrix and analyze temporal aspects of their diversification using\nrelaxed molecular clock methods calibrated with the fossil record. The\nmulti-locus approach resolves much of the previous phylogenetic\nuncertainty, but the radiation of families belonging to the core\nHalimedineae remains unresolved. In the Bryopsidales, three main clades\nwere inferred, two of which correspond to previously described suborders\n(Bryopsidineae and Halimedineae) and a third lineage that contains only\nthe limestone-boring genus Ostreobium. Relaxed molecular clock models\nindicate a Neoproterozoic origin of the siphonous green algae and a\nPaleozoic radiation of the orders into their families. The inferred node\nages are used to resolve conflicting hypotheses about species ages in\nthe tropical marine alga Halimeda. Interpretation of fossils as extant\nspecies should follow only from statistically sound morphometric\nanalyses, using time-series in various parts of the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Siphonous Algae, BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5450.phy"}]}
