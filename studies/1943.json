While there has been a long history of\nattempts to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships within this\nclade, studies have largely resulted in conflicting conclusions. Current\nideas regarding the limits of species and genera in this subfamily\n(Oligocottinae) and their branching order are based primarily on\nmorphology (Bolin 1944, 1947). The primary objectives of this study are:\n(a) to determine if the phylogenetic relationships inferred from DNA\ncharacters are concordant with those inferred from morphological\ncharacters and (b) to determine if a habitat shift from the subtidal to\nthe intertidal environment resulted in the diversification of the group.\nCytochrome b and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Dehydrogenase subunit\none mitochondrial gene fragments and one nuclear intron (S7 ribosomal\nprotein) were sequenced in order to infer the phylogenetic relationships\nwithin this subfamily. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian algorithms were\nemployed to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. We found that several genera\nin this clade are not monophyletic and that there is a clear\nphylogenetic signal indicating that a habitat shift from the subtidal to\nthe intertidal habitat has resulted in the diversification of the\nOligocottinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sculpin Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5000.phy"}]}
