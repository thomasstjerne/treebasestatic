Root samples were collected\nfrom eight individuals of M. hildebrandtii and two individuals of M.\ndrouhardii in Madagascar, and 21 individuals of M. oleifera in Uganda.\nTotal DNA was extracted from the root samples, and partial nSSU rDNA of\nAM fungi were amplified using a universal eukaryotic primer NS31 and an\nAM fungal-specific primer AM1. The PCR products were cloned and divided\nby restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with HinfI\nand RsaI. Some representatives in each RFLP types were sequenced, and a\nneighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was conducted for the obtained\nsequences with analogous sequences of AM fungi. The RFLP and\nphylogenetic analyses showed that the AM fungi closely related to Glomus\nintraradices or G. sinuosum were detected in many samples. The AM fungal\ngroups frequently detected in the Moringa spp. might be widely\ndistributed species in semi-arid environments.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringa AM fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5878.phy"}]}
