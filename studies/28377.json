Hyphoderma puerense is\ncharacterized by effused, basidiomata with smooth to flocculent hymenial\nsurface, a monomitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, and\nellipsoid basidiospores. Hyphoderma tenuissimum is characterized by\nresupinate basidiomata with tuberculate to minutely-grandinioid hymenial\nsurface, septate cystidia, and cylindrical to allantoid basidiospores.\nSequences of ITS+nLSU rRNA markers of the studied samples were\ngenerated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference methods. These\nanalyses showed that the two new species clustered into Hyphoderma, in\nwhich H. puerense grouped with H. moniliforme, and H. tenuissimum formed\na sister group to H. mopanshanense. In addition to the new species, an\nidentification key to Chinese Hyphoderma is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphodermataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134780.phy"}]}
