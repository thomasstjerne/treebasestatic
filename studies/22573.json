One hypogeous\nsecotioid species is proposed as Lactarius sulphosmus sp. nov. One\nagaricoid new species Russula vinosobrunneola sp. nov. is proposed and\nis morphologically distinguished from R. sichuanensis, although the\nITS-based phylogeny was incapable to separate them. Therefore a\nmulti-gene phylogenetic analysis of nLSU, ITS, mtSSU and tef-1α genes\nsequences of Russula subsection Laricinae was carried out, and the\nmulti-gene phylogeny supports them as different species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112484.phy"}]}
