Morphologically, it conforms with the characters\nof Monochaetia by the presence of a single apical and basal appendage on\nthe conidia. Considering phenotypic measurements of conidia, such as\nlength of apical and basal appendages, conidiogenous cells and molecular\nphylogeny of partial large subunit rRNA (LSU), internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS) and Î²-tubulin (TUB2), our taxon is distinguished from\nother Monochaetia species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111938","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111938.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111937","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111937.phy"}]}
