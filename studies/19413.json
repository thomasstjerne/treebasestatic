It is\ntypified by G. exilisporus sp. nov., and characterized by resupinate\nbasidiomata darkening in potassium hydroxide, a monomitic hyphal system\nwith simple-septate and hyaline to yellowish generative hyphae, and\nhyaline, thin-walled, and cylindrical to oblong-ellipsoid basidiospores.\nPhylogenetic analyses results inferred from 5.8S and nLSU rDNA sequences\nindicate that G. exilisporus belongs to Phanerochaetaceae in Polyporales\nand is closely related to the genus of Hyphodermella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geliporus exilisporus MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110250.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geliporus exilisporus MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110249.phy"}]}
