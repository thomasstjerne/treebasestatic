It is one of the most cultivated fruit crops\nin China due to the strong demand. Strawberry plants are susceptible to\nmany fungal diseases at different stages of their crop cycle. Leaf spot\nsymptoms on strawberry leaves were observed in a field in Guangdong\nprovince, China, during a collection survey in summer 2021. The fungus\nthat caused the leaf spots was isolated in the laboratory. Morphological\ncharacters and with combined gene analysis of LSU, SSU, ITS and TEF1-α\nsequence data, identified the pathogen as Pseudopithomyces maydicus\n(Didymosphaeriaceae), the fungal species associated with strawberry leaf\nspots. The pathogenicity of Pseudopithomyces maydicus was assessed on\npotted strawberry leaves and putative pathogen was isolated following\nthe Kochs postulates. This is the first report of Pseudopithomyces\nmaydicus causing leaf spots on strawberries in China. This study will\nprovide novel data to the micro fungi associated with strawberries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135607.phy"}]}
