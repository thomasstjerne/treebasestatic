Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony analyses\nrecovered similar trees and supported the monophyly of Hecalini and its\ntwo included subtribes, but excluded the Oriental genus Hecalusina He,\nZhang & Webb, the position of which was poorly resolved among the\nincluded outgroup taxa. Within subtribe Hecalina, the analysis recovered\ntwo major lineages, one including only New World taxa and the other\nincluding a second New World clade nested within a larger lineage\ncomprising taxa from the Afrotropical, Oriental, and Australian regions.\nThe large, widely distributed genus Hecalus was not recovered as\nmonophyletic. Species of this genus grouped into two separate,\nnoncontiguous clades, one North American and the other comprising\nAfrican, Australian, and Oriental species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hecalini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_107490.phy"}]}
