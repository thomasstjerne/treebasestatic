Analyses of morphological traits and\nmolecular sequence data led to identifications of the causal agents of\nthe powdery mildew diseases involved. Microidium bauhiniicola, hitherto\nonly known from Argentina and Brazil, is new to Mexico. The phylogenetic\nanalysis revealed an isolated position distant from Microidium\nindicating an undescribed genus, which is introduced as Bulbomicroidium\ngen. nov. Sequences derived from a Mexican specimen of C. lanestris on\nQuercus canbyi agree completely with other North American sequences, but\ndiffer from sequences retrieved from Asian collections, suggesting that\nC. lanestris in Asia is not conspecific with C. lanestris s. str. in\nNorth America. A new species of Phyllactinia on Mimosa malacophylla is\nmorphologically similar to P. dalbergiae but readily distinguishable by\ndifferences in the asexual morph. Based on morphological peculiarities\nand results of molecular sequence analyses, this species is described as\nPhyllactinia mimosae sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystotheca ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bauhinia Microidium 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllctinieae 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110635.phy"}]}
