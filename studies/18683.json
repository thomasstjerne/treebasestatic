It is characterized by the brightly\ncolored multi-storied basidiocarps. In this study, P. ailaoshanensis is\ndescribed and illustrated as a new species based on morphological and\nmolecular evidence. This species is characterized by its multi-storied\nbasidiocarps, zonate and fuzzy pileus, light ivory to yellow orange\npileal surface, hollow main axis and globose to subglobose basidiospores\n(4.15 × 3.94.8 μm). Phylogenetically, on the basis of combined dataset\nof the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear large subunit rDNA\n(nLSU), translation elongation factor 1-α gene (EF-1α) and small subunit\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), P. ailaoshanensis is strongly\nsupported as a new species of Podoserpula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93013","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93013.phy"}]}
