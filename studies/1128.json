One solution is to combine\nalgorithmically many small trees into a single, larger supertree. Here\nwe present a virtually complete, species-level phylogeny of the\nmarsupials (Mammalia: Metatheria), built by combining 158 phylogenetic\nestimates published since 1980, using Matrix Representation with\nParsimony. The supertree is well resolved overall (73.7%), although\nresolution varies across the tree, indicating variation both in the\namount of phylogenetic information available for different taxa, and the\ndegree of conflict among phylogenetic estimates. In particular, the\nsupertree shows poor resolution within the American marsupial taxa,\nreflecting a relative lack of systematic effort compared to the\nAustralasian taxa. There are also important differences in supertrees\nbased on source phylogenies published before 1995 and those published\nmore recently. The supertree can be viewed as a meta-analysis of\nmarsupial phylogenetic studies, and should be useful as a framework for\nphylogenetically explicit comparative studies of marsupial evolution and\necology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 2 and 4 to 10","ntax":"267","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marsupialia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1752.phy"}]}
