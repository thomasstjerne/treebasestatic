Likewise, phylogenetic studies sampling more than\njust a handful of the species of Symphoricarpos has not been pursued.\nHere I present evidence based on both chloroplast and nuclear DNA to\nhelp resolve the phylogenetic relationships of both the Caprifolieae, as\nwell as Symphoricarpos. For nuclear markers, I sequenced the ITS region\nin addition to the the geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR) gene, which\nappears to be present in only a single copy in Caprifolieae. Although\nGGR does not provide a great deal of resolution by itself, it does\nprovide additional phylogenetically informative characters. From these\ndata, there appears to be strong congruence between both the genomes\nwith respect to the relationships within Symphoricarpos, statistical\nsupport for any given hypothesis is weak. These additional data do not\nfurther support or clarify our understanding about the relationships\namong members of the Caprifolieae, showing conflicting results between\nthe chloroplast and nuclear genomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symphoricarpos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6670.phy"}]}
