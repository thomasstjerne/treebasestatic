Both species were\nsuccessfully induced for teleomorphic stages. Morphological comparisons\nwere made with similar species. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred\nbased on ITS, ACT, TEF, and GAPDH sequences. Colletotrichum\ncamelliae-japonicae belongs to the C. boninense species complex, while\nC. aracearum does not nest within any known species complex and forms\nsister clade to C. cliviae. This is the first report of Colletotrichum\nspecies from hosts Monstera delociosa and Philodenron selloum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98675","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98676","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98676.phy"}]}
