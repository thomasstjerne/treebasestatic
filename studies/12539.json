Uncinula\nare described and illustrated. Erysiphe havrylenkoana is a new species\nfound on Nothofagus alpina and N. obliqua in Argentina, and E. prunastri\nvar. japonica is a new variety collected on Prunus maximowiczii in\nJapan. Erysiphe havrylenkoana differs from E. nothofagi, E. patagoniaca\nand E. magellanica in having unique helicoid appendages, brownish from\nthe base to the beginning of helicoid part, spirally twisted at the\ncenter and straight or not spiral at the upper part with uncinate to\ncircinate tip. The phylogenetic analyses of rDNA sequences clearly\nshowed that the spiral pattern of helicoid appendages is an important\nmorphological character to delimit species among Nothofagus powdery\nmildews. Erysiphe prunastri var. japonica is distinct from E. prunastri\nvar. prunastri parasitizing hitherto Prunus species from East-Central\nAsia to Europe by having mainly 8 asci per chasmothecium and smooth,\nrarely septate appendages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52281.phy"}]}
