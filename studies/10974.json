A short revision of the vagrant Aspicilia\nspecies of North America is presented based on morphological, molecular\nand ecological data. Vagrant Aspicilia are common lichens throughout the\nsteppes of the northwestern USA and southwestern parts of Canada.\nSpecies delimitation of these lichens is difficult because of the\npaucity of morphological characters and large degree of variation.\nRepresentatives of North American and Eurasian species of Aspicilia\nfruticulosa and A. hispida were studied. Nucleotide sequence data (nuITS\nrDNA) from both Eurasian and American species were obtained, selected\nmorphological features (i.e., cortex, branching pattern, position of\npycnidia and shape of conidia) are illustrated and main distinguishing\ncharacters are tabulated. The results conclusively reveal that the\nAmerican vagrant species, known as Aspicilia fruticulosa, is distinct\nand accordingly described here as Aspicilia rogeri. sp. nov. The\nphylogenetic relationships of the new taxon are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspicilia rogeri","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25558.phy"}]}
