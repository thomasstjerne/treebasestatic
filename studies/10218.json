The first one,\nRamophialophora humicola, isolated from a soil sample collected in Ronda\n(Spain), is characterized by producing profusely branched conidiophores\nending in sterile, sometimes swollen apices, and subhyaline, dacryoid\nconidia born from both integrated and discrete phialides with\nconspicuous collaretes. ITS sequence data reveal its relationships with\nmembers of the Sordariales and its genetic differences with other fungi\nmorphologically close, such as Cladorrhinum spp. The second species,\nFibulochlamys chilensis, isolated from a soil sample collected in La\nJunta (Chile), is characterized by possessing micronematous, clamped,\nmostly branched conidiophores producing thallic, one-celled, very\nthick-walled conidia which exhibit strongly wrinkled surfaces in age.\nThe analysis of partial sequences of the ITS region and 28S rRNA gene\nreveal that this fungus is close to members of the gilled\nAgaricales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ramophialophora and other Sordariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6829.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fibulochlamys chilensis and other basidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6745.phy"}]}
