We have tested the hypothesis for Australian Fossombronia that\nusing spore morphology is sufficient to identify species by based on a\nmonophyly criterion applied to a molecular phylogeny. We used the\nchloroplast markers rps4 and trnL-F and the nuclear internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region to develop a phylogeny based on multiple accessions\nper putative morphospecies. Whilst the relationship between species had\nlittle support, the results did strongly support seven out of the eight\nspecies groupings based on spore morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr30077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_30077.phy"}]}
