Helicoma chiayiense is distinct in\nhaving hyaline conidiophores arising from repent mycelium, producing\nbroad conidia that bear secondary conidia. Helicosporium taiwanense is\ndistinct in having robust poly-denticulate conidiophores producing\nconidia with a wide conidial filament. The phylogenetic relationship of\nthese species were sought among representative taxa of the helicosporous\nhyphomycetes by comparing their ITS of the rDNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106501.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_tree_fig9","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106503","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106503.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree fig10","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106504.phy"}]}
