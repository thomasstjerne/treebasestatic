The dinoflagellates belong to the genus\nApocalathium: A. aciculiferum from Scandinavian freshwater lakes, A.\nmalmogiense from the Baltic Sea and A. aff. malmogiense from brackish\nAntarctic lakes. Our results show that A. aciculiferum separated from\nother lineages. We hypothesized that the main reason of this event is a\nlocal adaptation. The results are congruent with the dinoflagellates\nmorphologies. Overall, we have shown that transcriptomes are useful to\ndelineate recently diversified protists. This is of great importance,\nbecause many phytoplankton including harmful algal species, are\nmorphologically very similar and single genes lack sufficient\ninformation to determine speciesÂ’ relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106774","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106774.phy"}]}
