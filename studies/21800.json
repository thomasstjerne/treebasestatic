This combined methodological approach allowed the\nidentification of 14 known species and one new species, Cortinarius\nortegae, all inhabiting different Iberian and Balearic Islands\nwoodlands. Distinctive traits of the new taxon are the ochraceous-brown\npileus with some faint orange hues, the moderately reddish brown KOH\nreaction on pileus cuticle, the relatively stout stipe which is shorter\nthan the pileus diameter, the greyish or orange brown KOH reaction on\nstipe bulb context, and its symbiotic association with Quercus ilex\nsubsp. rotundifolia. Polymorphism analyses within some studied species\nshowed that the distribution of intraspecific lineages is dependent on\ngeography and, in some cases, tree host. Furthermore, the dating\nanalysis suggested that diversification within Calochroi started in the\nPliocene and that most of the current genetic diversity originated in\nthe Pleistocene. This temporal scenario supports the hypotheses of\nclimatic oscillations in the Quaternary driving the evolution of this\ngroup of ectomycorrhizal fungi","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius Calochroi ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107861.phy"}]}
