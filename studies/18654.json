The gene was, therefore, named CsGH3-1.\nPredicted protein sequence analysis revealed the presence of conserved\ndomains involved in the conjugation of amino acids to indole-3-acetic\nacid (IAA). Modelling of the protein and molecular docking of IAA,\nindole-3-butyric-acid (IBA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and\nbenzothiazole-2-oxyacetic acid (BTOA) into the active site of CsGH3-1\nindicated a high and similar binding affinity for the four substrates.\nExpression analysis by qPCR indicated that CsGH3-1 is regulated by\nwounding, darkness, and auxin in chestnut microshoots, in an\nontogenetic-dependent manner. Under IBA treatment, upregulation of\nCsGH3-1 was higher in mature than in juvenile shoots and was negatively\ncorrelated with the ability of microshoots to form roots. High levels of\nauxin-induced expression of CsGH3-1 were detected in mature shoots 24 h\nafter the IBA treatment, whereas transcript levels decreased in\nrooting-competent shoots with cell-type-specific expression. CsGH3-1\ntranscripts were specifically localized in cells involved in the\ninitiation of adventitious roots only in rooting-competent shoots at the\ntime when cells switch their fate to root initial cells. Thus, these\ndata show a correlation between the specific localization of transcripts\nand rooting competence, and they also suggest a role for CsGH3-1 in\nregulating auxin homeostasis during the onset of adventitious root\nformation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GH3 expression in chestnut","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92837.phy"}]}
