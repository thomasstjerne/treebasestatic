P. Karst., Polyporus varius (Pers.) Fr. and Hymenopellis radicata\n(Relhan) R.H. Petersen) from several mountain forest ecosystems in\nSerbia (Tara, Kopaonik and Stara planina), as well as reveal their\nphylogenetic relations with same and related species from other parts of\nthe world. Species identification was done by combining morphological\nand molecular data employing ITS1 - 5.8S - ITS2 region of rDNA.\nPhylogenetic trees were constructed and average genetic distances were\ndiscussed based on information obtained from the sequence analysis of\nsampled species and their comparison to 197 sequences from NCBI and\nUNITES databases. In order to estimate the importance of polymorphism\nwithin different sequences for their specific grouping in the\nphylogenetic tree, all relevant sequences were analyzed by employing\nalignment tool as well as looking for their specific polymorphic sites\nwithin main clade of each analyzed species. For the first time, inter\nand intraspecific relations as well as genetic origin of each selected\nspecies from the region of Serbia was revealed. Serbian fungal isolates\ncomprise a specific genetic group within species Fomitopsis pinicola,\nPolyporus varius and Hymenopellis radicata, as well as fall into the\nclades with European origin. A phylogenetic gap between Serbian species\nand other phylogenetically related ones could implicate that they are\neventually evolutionary conserved, supporting the high conservation\npriority of Balkan Peninsulas forest ecosystems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenopellis phylogenetic tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103134.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitopsis phylogenetic tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus phylogenetic tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103133.phy"}]}
