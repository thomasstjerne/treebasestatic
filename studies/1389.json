The\nstrongest argument for such theories was provided by Carex microglochin\nand Uncinia kingii, a seemingly indisputable link between Carex and\nUncinia. In this study we examine the limits of Uncinia by focusing on\nthese transitional species and their allies in Carex subg. Psyllophora,\na reduced unispicate group whose species are largely responsible for\nblurring generic and Carex subgeneric limits. Phylogenies derived from\nITS and ETS 1f sequences representing 72 taxa and all five Cariceae\ngenera distinguished four major clades (A, B, C, D), including a\npredominately unispicate, androgynous clade (A and B) that rejects the\nclassic Uncinia kingii/Carex microglochin transition series (i.e., they\nare polyphyletic). Nonetheless, analyses strongly support a sister\nrelationship between Uncinia s.s. and U. kingii. This is an unexpected\nresult for strong anatomical and morphological evidence would suggest\nthat U. kingii is closest to C. microglochin and its allies. Moreover,\nthe sister position of U. kingii to Uncinia s.s. suggests that contrary\nto previous classifications of Uncinia the characters of Uncinia sect.\nUncinia are plesiomorphic. This means that despite sect. Uncinia being\nlargely natural in this analysis, it - like Uncinia s.l. - cannot be\ndefined by any known morphological apomorphy. The implications of the\nanalysis for generic and Carex subgeneric relationships, including the\nsubgeneric and sectional classification of Uncinia, are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unispicate taxa in Cyperaceae tribe Cariceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2194.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony 8 WORST","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 One of 22 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2192.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony 10 BEST","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 One of 22 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2193.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4, ETS Indels","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unispicate taxa in Cyperaceae tribe Cariceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 ITS Indels","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unispicate taxa in Cyperaceae tribe Cariceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2196.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unispicate taxa in Cyperaceae tribe Cariceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2197.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leuco U. kingii Uncinia no","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2198.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leuco U. kingii no micro1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2199.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leucoglochin no micro1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2200.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leuco U. kingii Uncinia","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2201.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leuco U. kingii","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2202.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Leucoglochin","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Table 3 Constrained Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2203.phy"}]}
