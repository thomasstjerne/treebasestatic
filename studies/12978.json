Particularly\nimportant has been the discovery and reinterpretation of Late Jurassic\ntyrannosauroids from Europe and North America, which are intermediate in\nsize and phylogenetic position between small basal tyrannosauroids and\nthe largest Late Cretaceous species. The fragmentary nature of these\nJurassic specimens, however, has frustrated attempts to understand their\nsystematics and phylogeny. A new specimen from the Late Jurassic of\nEngland was recently named as a new species (S. langhami) of the genus\nStokesosaurus, which is known from several fragmentary fossils from\nNorth America. We review the systematics and phylogeny of these European\nand North American specimens and show that there are no unequivocal\nsynapomorphies uniting them. Furthermore, a revised phylogenetic\nanalysis does not recover them as sister taxa. This necessitates a\ntaxonomic revision of this material, and we name a new genus\n(Juratyrant) for the British specimen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tyrannosaurid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55061.phy"}]}
