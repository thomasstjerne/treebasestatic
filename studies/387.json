It turned out that the so-called genus\nIsabellaria is a polyphyletic entity; the diagnostic, apomorphic\nstructure of its clausilial apparatus, enabling a nearly complete\nobstruction of the shell aperture with the animal at rest, apparently\nevolved more than once from ancestors currently classified with the\nspeciose genus Albinaria. The classification based on general shell\nshape and sculpture, and distributional patterns, turns out to be the\nnatural one. This study also provides the first data on ITS1 sequences\nin gastropods. The recently published ITS1 sequence of another molluscan\nspecies, a bivalve, is quite different but similar in length to that of\nthe snails.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3332.phy"}]}
