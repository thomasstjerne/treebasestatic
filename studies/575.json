The genera\nLathraea, Harveya, and Hyobanche have been viewed as transitional links\nbetween the parasitic members of Scrophulariaceae and the strictly\nholoparasitic habit of the traditional Orobanchaceae. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of plastid rps2 and matK sequences were performed. The\ntransitional genera are not transitional to the traditional\nOrobanchaceae, but represent multiple independent origins of\nholoparasitism. Within Scrophulariaceae, the two traditional subfamilies\nRhinanthoideae and Antirrhinoideae are defined by the arrangement of the\ncorolla lobes during aestivation. However, neither of the two\nsubfamilies is monophyletic in our analyses, suggesting that corolla\nlobe position is a homoplastic character. While the traditional\nOrobanchaceae are monophyletic, tribes Buchnereae and Rhinantheae are\nclearly not, and genus Orobanche probably is not. Clades of parasitic\ngenera correspond well with biogeographic provinces. One strongly\nsupported clade contains the parasitic Scrophulariaceae, the traditional\nOrobanchaceae, and Lindenbergia. It is proposed that this clade be\ndefined as the Orobanchaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orobanchaceae and related taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3507.phy"}]}
