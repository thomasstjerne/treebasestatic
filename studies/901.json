However, there is little support for the most basal branches of\nthe radula-less dorid clade. Most of the traditional groups within the\nradula-less dorids are monophyletic and for the most part well\nsupported. These include the genera Dendrodoris, Doriopsilla,\nReticulidia, Phyllidiella and Phyllidia (when Fryeria is included in\nPhyllidia). On the contrary, the family Dendrodorididae and the genus\nPhyllidiopsis are paraphyletic. Branch support for those arrangements\nthat differ from the topology of previously published morphological\ntrees is poor. Data obtained from the 16S mtDNA gene seem to be adequate\nto resolve the phylogenetic relationships of derived clades of\nradula-less dorids, but longer sequences are necessary to obtain more\ninformation at the most basal nodes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Porostomata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5740.phy"}]}
