Hyphoderma puerense is characterized by effused,\nbasidiomata with smooth to flocculent hymenial surface, a monomitic\nhyphal system with clamped generative hyphae and ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. Hyphoderma tenuissimum is characterized by resupinate\nbasidiomata with tuberculate to minutely-grandinioid hymenial surface,\npresence of septate cystidia and cylindrical to allantoid basidiospores.\nSequences of ITS+nLSU rRNA gene regions of the studied samples were\ngenerated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference methods. These\nphylogenetic analyses showed that two new species clustered into\nHyphoderma, in which H. puerense grouped with H. moniliforme, and H.\ntenuissimum was sister to H. mopanshanense. In addition to new species,\nidentification key to Chinese Hyphoderma are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphodermataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134425.phy"}]}
