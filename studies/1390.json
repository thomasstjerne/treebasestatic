Here this clade is proposed as the new genus Auritella.\nSeven species are fully documented with taxonomic descriptions and\nillustrations, four of which are described as new. A key to genera and\nmajor clades of the Inocybaceae and a key to species of Auritella are\nprovided. A maximum likelihood tree using rpb2 and nLSU-rDNA nucleotide\nsequences depicts the phylogenetic relationships of five of the seven\nspecies of the genus, of which the Australian taxa form a monophyletic\ngroup. An ancient split between Australian and African lineages is\nhypothesized using a molecular clock that dates back at least to the\nlate Cretaceous (about 86 Ma). Diversification of Australian species of\nAuritella is estimated to have first occurred in the early Tertiary\n(about 60 Ma).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML clock tree of Auritella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2282.phy"}]}
