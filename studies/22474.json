Aleurodiscus bambusinus was collected from Jiangxi\nProvince, southern China on bamboo and is distinct by having a compact\ntexture, simple-septate generative hyphae, numerous acanthophyses,\nbasidia with a acanthophysoid appendage and smooth spores. Aleurodiscus\nchangbaiensis was collected from Jilin Province, northeastern China on\nangiosperm wood and is distinct by having clamped generative hyphae,\nnumerous acanthophyses and small smooth basidiospores. Aleurodiscus\nisabellinus was collected from Yunnan Province, southwestern China on\nboth bamboo and angiosperm wood and is distinct by having yellow to\nyellowish brown basidiocarps and acanthophyses, simple septate\ngenerative hyphae and smooth basidiospores. Aleurodiscus subroseus was\ncollected from Guangxi Autonomus Region, southern China on angiosperm\nwood and is distinct by having pinkish basidiocarps when fresh, clamped\ngenerative hyphae and echinulate basidiospores. In the phylogenetic\ntree, A. bambusinus, A. changbaiensis and A. isabellinus were nested\nwithin the A. cerussatus group, whilst A. subroseus formed a lineage\nsister to A. wakefieldiae. An identification key to 27 species in China\nis provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrul","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aleurodiscus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111985.phy"}]}
