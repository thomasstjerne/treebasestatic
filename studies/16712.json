Two groups within these Californian Salvia traditionally\nhave been recognized (usually treated as sections), but relationships\nwithin each, to each other, and to other Salvia are not known.\nPhylogenetic relationships of all species, with multiple accessions for\nmost, were obtained using chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal\nDNA (nrDNA) markers. Ancestral character state reconstruction of both\nvegetative and floral features was done on the resulting nrDNA tree.\nBiogeographical analysis of the groups within the CA-FP and adjacent\nfloristic provinces was done in BioGeoBEARS and species diversification\nassessed with BAMM. Significant conclusions drawn from the study\ninclude: 1) California sages should be classified into two monophyletic\nsections, Audibertia (15 spp.) and Echinosphace, (4 spp.) in the new\nsubgenus Audibertia; 2) subg. Audibertia and the Neotropical subg.\nCalosphace are sister clades, most closely related to Asian groups, and\nare likely Asian in origin; 3) nrDNA provides a fairly resolved tree for\nsubg. Audibertia with all species monophyletic; 4) cpDNA and nrDNA trees\nare strongly incongruent and provide evidence that hybridization and\nchloroplast capture have played an important role in the evolution of\nsubg. Audibertia; 5) ancestral character reconstruction of states in\nhabit, possession of spines, calyx lobing, and staminal features\nhighlights a complex (sometimes convergent) evolutionary history of this\niconic CA-FP lineage; 6) subg. Audibertia arose in desert areas and more\nrecently diversified into the Southwestern California Region and\nadjacent regions with the formation of the Mediterranean climate; and 7)\nthis diversification exhibits a slight decrease and increase in\nspeciation and extinction rates, respectively, over the groupÂ’s 11\nmillion year history.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87973.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87976.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87977.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87975.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87978.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87980.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87979.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salvia Audibertia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87974.phy"}]}
