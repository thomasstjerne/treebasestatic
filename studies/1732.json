While these retrotransposons are abundant\nin many animal genomes, the reverse transcriptase moiety can also be\nfound in several protists, fungi, and plants, indicating its ancient\norigin. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of PLEs was conducted,\nbased on extended sequence alignments and a considerably expanded\ndataset. PLEs exhibit the pattern of evolution similar to that of\nnon-LTR retrotransposons, which form deep-branching clades dating back\nto the Precambrian era. However, PLEs seem to have experienced a much\nhigher degree of lineage losses than non-LTR retrotransposons. It is\nsuggested that PLEs and non-LTR retrotransposons are included into a\nlarger eTPRT (eukaryotic target-primed) group of retroelements,\ncharacterized by 5’ truncation, variable target-site duplication, and\nthe potential of the 3’ end to participate in formation of\nnon-autonomous derivatives.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penelope-like Retroelements","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_968.phy"}]}
