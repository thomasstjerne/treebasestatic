The phylogenetic data showed that Acrophialophora and\nTaifanglania together constitute a monophyletic clade, but did not\nsupport the separation of two genera. Being the older and more\nfrequently used name, Acrophialophora is adopted as the generic name.\nTaifanglania is treated as a later synonym of Acrophialophora. The\ngeneric concept of Acrophialophora is updated. In addition, three new\nthermotolerant species isolated from soil samples in China were\ndescribed and illustrated in this paper. A. ellipsoidea sp. nov. is\ncharacterized by solitary phialides tapering into thin necks, and\nellipsoidal to fusiform conidia formed in long chains. A. angustiphialis\nsp. nov. is characterized by single phialides on tip or lateral of\nhyphae, and ellipsoidal or fusiform conidia. A. acuticonidiata sp. nov.\nis characterized by single phialides and fusiform conidia with prominent\ntips at each end. Phylogenetic analyses show that A. acuticonidiata , A.\nangustiphialis and A. ellipsoidea are most closely related to A.\ncurticatenata, A. hechuanensis and A. major, respectively. The\ntemperature test showed that the three new species are thermotolerant,\nwith optimal growth temperature between 37 Â°C and 40 Â°C, and maximum\ngrowth temperature near 50 Â°C. A key to the accepted species in\nAcrophialophora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Br Lens","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acrophialophora ITS SSU TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80096.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acrophialophora and Taifanglania ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80098.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acrophialophora ITS SSU TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80095.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acrophialophora ITS SSU TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80094.phy"},{"tree_label":"maj rule of 34","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acrophialophora and Taifanglania ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80099.phy"}]}
