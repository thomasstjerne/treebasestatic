Callianthemum\ncontains ca. 14 species, of which ca. 11 are distributed in Asia and\nthree in Europe. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus using\nITS and four plastid DNA sequences (matK, rpL32-trnL intergenic spacer,\ntrnL-trnF intergenic spacer, trnV-ndhC intergenic spacer) revealed that\nthe genus reached Europe twice with C. coriandrifolium representing one\nand C. anemonoides and C. kernerianum a second lineage. Support for C.\nanemonoides and C. kernerianum as sister species is weak. The crown\ngroup ages of the C. coriandrifolium lineage (median 2.2 million years)\nand of the C. anemonoides/C. kernerianum lineage (median 1.62 million\nyears) are similar and place their immigration to Europe in the\nQuaternary. Analysis of climatic data shows that C. coriandrifolium\ngrows in colder climate than C. anemonoides/C. kernerianum, and that the\nclimatic niches of the three European species are different considering\nall climatic variables analyzed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callianthemum trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117332.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callianthemum rpL32-trnL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117333.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callianthemum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117336.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callianthemum trnV-ndhC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117335.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callianthemum matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117334.phy"}]}
