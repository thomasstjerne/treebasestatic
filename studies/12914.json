However, the taxonomic status\nof these genera remains controversial. To demonstrate the phylogenetic\nrelationships of these genera, five gene regions [Alternaria alternata\nmajor allergen (Alt a 1), ï¢-tubulin, elongation factor 1ï¡ (EF-1ï¡),\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) and the second largest\nsubunits of RNA polymerase II (rpb2)] were sequenced. The phylogenetic\nanalyses have revealed that the Alternaria group is represented by two\nclades. The Nimbya group indicated a distant relationship with other\nspecies. Three Sinomyces species grouped into an independent clade. The\nAlternaria genus was polyphyletic, and formed two mainly independent\nclades. Embellisia was also not monophyletic but only four species\nclustered together. The Ulocladium group included A. cheiranthi and E.\nindefessa. The Sinomyces and Nimbya genera were monophyletic, while the\nAlternaria species may be resolved as two genera. Meanwhile, the\ntaxonomic status of Embellisia and Ulocladium needs to be\nrevisited.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53866.phy"}]}
