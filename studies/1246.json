This study\nexamined whether genes that are less conserved than the 16S rRNA gene\nwould distinguish Ca. P. australiense strains that are identical based\non their 16S rRNA genes. The capacity to distinguish these phytoplasmas\nmay provide insight into their origin and distribution, and may show a\npattern of association with particular plant hosts. Sequence analysis of\nthe tuf gene and rp operon showed that Ca. P. australiense strains could\nbe differentiated into four subgroups, which were named\n16SrXII-B(tuf-Australia I)(rp-A), 16SrXII-B(tuf-New Zealand I; rp-B),\n16SrXII-B(tuf-New Zealand II) and 16SrXII-B (rp-C). Strawberry lethal\nyellows 1 (SLY1), strawberry green petal (SGP), Australian grapevine\nyellows, pumpkin yellow leaf curl and cottonbush witches\u001a broom\nphytoplasmas were designated members of 16SrXII-B (tuf-Australia I;\nrp-A) subgroup. The strawberry lethal yellows 2 and cottonbush reduced\nyellow leaves phytoplasmas were assigned to 16SrXII (tuf-New Zealand II;\nrp-B) subgroup. No relationship was observed between these phytoplasma\nsubgroups and collection date, location or host plant. However, the\nstudy revealed evolutionary divergence in the 16SrXII group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tu elongation factor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1939.phy"},{"tree_label":"Table 2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ribosomal protein operon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1940.phy"}]}
