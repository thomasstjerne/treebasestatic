We\ndescribe the ovulate cone anatomy of Pinus nelsonii, a rare and\nphylogenetically isolated pinyon pine endemic to Mexico, and add the\nspecies together with Pinus ponderosa and the fossil Pinus belgica to a\nrecoded and expanded ovulate cone morphology matrix for fossil and\nextant Pinaceae. The cone anatomy of Pinus nelsonii conforms to previous\ngeneric concepts of Pinus. Despite its phylogenetically isolated\nposition among the soft pines (Pinus subgenus Strobus) and thus\npotential for displaying plesiomorphic features, the cone of Pinus\nnelsonii is unlike the oldest Pinus fossil cones in possessing enlarged,\nfunctionally wingless seeds partially embedded in scale tissue, and in\nlacking sclerenchyma in the cortex of the axis, in the bract, and in the\nscale. Cladistic analysis of cone morphology characters recovers several\nPityostrobus species in a clade with Pinus. Although the inferred\nrelationships among living species do not coincide in several respects\nto molecular studies, adding taxa and further exploration of characters\npromises to clarify relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pinus nelsonii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_26291.phy"}]}
