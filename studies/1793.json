Despite its new circumscription\nas a monotypic genus (Rhopalobrachium fragrans) the tribal placement of\nRhopalobrachium remained unknown. We investigated for Rhopalobrachium\nfragrans all morphological characters currently used for circumscribing\ntribes in the subfamily Ixoroideae sensu lato. The species has axillary\ninflorescences, with valvate flower aestivation, drupaceous fruits with\na single pendulous ovule per locule, and 3-pororate pollen grains. We\nalso performed Bayesian and parsimony analyses based on two chloroplast\nmarkers, rps16 intron and trnT-F region, to assess the phylogenetic\nposition of Rhopalobrachium within Ixoroideae sensu lato. These analyses\nproduced well-resolved and strongly supported topologies. The results of\nboth the morphological survey and phylogenetic analyses indicated a\nposition of Rhopalobrachium fragrans in the tribe Vanguerieae and a\nclose relationship with the Pacific genus Cyclophyllum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ixoroideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2743.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vanguerieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2744.phy"}]}
