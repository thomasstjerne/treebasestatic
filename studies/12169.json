The critical issue is to quantify the uncertainty of the\ninference. The posterior probabilities in Bayesian phylogenetic\ninference and the bootstrap values in frequentist approaches measure the\nvariability of the estimates due to the sampling of sites from genes and\nthe sampling of genes from genomes. However, they do not measure the\nuncertainty due to taxon sampling. Taxa that experienced molecular\nhomoplasy, recent selection, a spur of evolution and so forth may\ndisrupt the inference and cause incongruences in the estimated\nphylogeny. We define a Taxon Influence Index to assess the influence of\neach taxon on the phylogeny. We found that although most taxa have a\nweak influence on the phylogeny, a small fraction of influential taxa\nstrongly alter it, even in clades only loosely related to them. We\nconclude that highly influential taxa should be given special attention\nand sampling them more thoroughly can lead to more dependable\nphylogenies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mammalian Mitochondrial ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61622.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reptile Mitochondrial ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61623.phy"}]}
