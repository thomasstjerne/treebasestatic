A characteristic morphological feature of this fungus is the\nremarkable variations in the sporangiospore shape. This implies the\ngenetic variations occur in the nucleotide sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) in\nthe U. ramanniana isolates. The relationship between the variations of\nthe sequences of the nrDNA ITS regions and those of the sporangiospore\nmorphology was investigated for 12 isolates of U. ramanniana collected\nin Europe. Neighbor joining and parsimony analyses on the sequences\nsuggested that these isolates split into 3 groups. Precise examination\nof the morphology showed that the isolates of those respective groups\nwere different from each other in their sporangiospore shape. The\npresent study implies at least 3 intraspecific groups exist in U.\nramanniana and that the variations in the nucleotide sequences of the\nnrDNA ITS regions correlate well with those in the sporangiospore shape\nin these intraspecific groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 right","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 left","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2286.phy"}]}
