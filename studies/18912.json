This economically\nimportant forest tree is exploited mainly for the production of pulp for\nthe paper industry. The community of Botryosphaeriaceae species\noccurring on diseased and healthy E. globulus trees was studied on\nplantations throughout the country. Nine species from three different\ngenera were identified, namely Botryosphaeria (B. dothidea), Diplodia\n(D. corticola and D. seriata) and Neofusicoccum (N. australe, N.\nalgeriense, N. eucalyptorum, N. kwambonambiense, N. parvum and\nNeofusicoccum sp.). Of these, N. algeriense, D. corticola and D. seriata\nare reported for the first time on E. globulus, while N. algeriense, N.\neucalyptorum and N. kwambonambiense correspond to first reports in\nPortugal. The genus Neofusicoccum was clearly dominant with N. australe\nand N. eucalyptorum being the most abundant species on both diseased and\nhealthy trees. In artificial inoculation trials representative isolates\nfrom all nine species were shown to be pathogenic to E. globulus but\nthere were marked differences in aggressiveness between them. Thus, D.\ncorticola and N. kwambonambiense were the most aggressive while B.\ndothidea and D. seriata were the least aggressive of the species\nstudied.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97606.phy"}]}
