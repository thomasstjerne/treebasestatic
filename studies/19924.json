A molecular study was combined with a morphological study,\nin which the collections were compared with herbarium material. The\nmolecular study indicated that four Thai collections belonged to\nundescribed species within Lactifluus section Gerardii, as was also the\ncase for herbarium collections of a pleurotoid species from Nepal. One\nother collection from Thailand appeared closely related to Lf. uyedae,\nknown only from Japan. Five species are described as new in the genus:\nLf. auriculiformis, Lf. gerardiellus, Lf. bhandaryi, Lf. pulchrellus and\nLf. raspei.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112342","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112342.phy"}]}
