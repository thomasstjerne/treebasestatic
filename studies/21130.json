Cyclobalanopsidis\nin East Asia (China and Japan). In the previous report, we found that E.\ngracilis var. gracilis is divided into four genotypes that form each\nseparate clade with strong bootstrap support. In this study, we further\ninvestigated genotype speciation in E. gracilis var. longissima\noccurring on Q. acuta and Q. sessilifolia, and found that this variety\nis divided into two distinct genotypes, too. These results suggested\nthat E. gracilis is a species complex consisting of six true species.\nBased on the detailed morphological examinations, we proposed to divide\nE. gracilis into three new species (E. uncinuloides, E. pseudogracilis,\nand E. longifilum), one new combination (E. longissima), and two known\nspecies (E. gracilis s. str. and E. hiratae). Diagnosis key for these\nspecies were also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe gracilis 28s_56taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105194.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe gracilis ITS+28S_37taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe gracilis IGS62taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105196.phy"}]}
