Phylogenetic analyses of molecular\ndata recover a predominantly New World clade as sister to a solitary\nEast Asian species, C. maackii. Nuclear ribosomal DNA are congruent in\nthe placement of all taxa within the section, with a solitary exception:\nincongruence between ITS and ETS data in the placement of C. bonplandii\nand C. roraimensis suggests a hybrid origin for this lineage.\nBiogeography correlates strongly with phylogeny in the section, but\nthere have been at least two instances of long-range dispersal, one from\nan eastern North American clade to western North America and one from\nthe New World to Eurasia. Morphological characters studied are all\nhomoplastic. Developing a comprehensive infrasectional classification\nwith a phylogenetic basis would be complicated by the fact that most of\nthe novel morphological characters in the section have evolved within\nrelatively small, independent clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex section Ovales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2800.phy"}]}
