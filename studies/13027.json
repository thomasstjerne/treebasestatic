Details of the braincase, palate, and nasal crest that were\neither missed or disputed by previous authors are clarified. The nasal\ncrest is buttressed caudally and caudolaterally by elongations of the\nfrontals and prefrontals, respectively. The unique morphology of the\nfrontals and prefrontals permit differentiation of S. osborni from other\nhadrosaurs. S. osborni can be differentiated from Saurolophus\nangustirostris by a relatively shorter frontal contribution to the nasal\ncrest, a relatively straight premaxilla in lateral view, a weakly\nupturned oral margin of the premaxilla, and the absence of a vertical\nsulcus on the prootic above cranial nerve V. A reassessment of the\nphylogenetic affinities of S. osborni, exclusive of S. angus- tirostris,\nsuggests it is most closely related to the Laurasian taxa Prosaurolophus\nand Kerberosaurus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 14","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55269.phy"}]}
