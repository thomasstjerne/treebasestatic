The data set\ncomprises morphological, anatomical, biochemical, and some DNA\nstructural characters for a taxon sample of 35 species, including\nrepresentatives of all major lineages of vascular plants, especially\nferns. Phylogenetic relationships among vascular plants are\nreconstructed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Both\napproaches yield similar relationships and provide evidence for three\nmajor lineages of extant vascular plants: lycophytes, ferns, and seed\nplants. Lycophytes are sister to the euphyllophyte clade, which\ncomprises the fern and seed plant lineages. The fern lineage consists of\nfive clades: horsetails, whisk ferns, ophioglossoids, marattioids, and\nleptosporangiate ferns. This lineage is supported by characters of the\nspore wall and has a parsimony bootstrap value of 76%, although the\nposterior probability is much below 0.95. Each of the five fern clades\nis well supported, but the relationships among them lack statistical\nsupport. Our independent phylogenetic analyses of morphological evidence\nrecover the same deep phylogenetic relationships among tracheophytes as\nfound in previous studies utilizing DNA sequence data, but differ in\nsome ways within seed plants and within ferns. We discuss the extensive\nindependent evolution of the five extant fern clades and the evidence\nfor the placement of horsetails in our morphological analyses, evidence\nincluding non-homogeneity of morphological variation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6179.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6180.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 5","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6181.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 6","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6182.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6178.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Bootstrap Cons","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6544.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 7","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6183.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tracheophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6177.phy"}]}
