A total of 109 fungal isolates were\nobtained from 900 segments. All fungal isolates were identified based on\ntheir morphological characteristics. Thirty-six fungal isolates were\nselected by their morphological appearance on potato dextrose agar and\ncultured into potato dextrose broth. Fungal endophytes and each part of\nplant (leaves, flowers and stamens) were extracted with hexane, ethyl\nacetate and methanol. One hundred and eight crude extracts from fungal\nendophytes and nine crude extracts from N. nuciferawere determined for\ntheir antimicrobial and antioxidant activities by using a colorimetric\nbroth microdilution test and DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Cell\nethyl acetate extract (CE) obtained from fungal isolate LF020\n(Curvularia geniculata) and FL014 (Curvularia sp.) was the most active\nagainst S. aureus (MIC 8 ug/ml) and MRSA (MIC 4 ug/ml). CE extracts of\nfungal isolates FL033 (Fusarium verticillioides.) and FL048 (\nPenicillium sclerotiorum) gave the strongest against Cryptococcus\nneoformans with MIC 16 ug/ml. On the other hand, plant extracts showed\nthe lowest antimicrobial activity with MIC 1000 ug/ml. For antioxidant\nassay, CE extract from fungal endophytes isolate LF020 had the highest\nantioxidant activity with inhibitory concentration (IC50) 0.55mg/ml,\nfollowed by CE extract from stamen with IC50 of 0.59 mg/ml. This study\nconfirmed that endophytic fungi investigated from N. nucifera is a good\nsource of novel metabolites for future pharmaceutical applications.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102248.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102247.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102246.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102245.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102251.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102250.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102249.phy"}]}
