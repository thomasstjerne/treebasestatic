The taxonomic placement of\nnew genus within Lysiterminae is discussed on the basis of a\nphylogenetic analysis using sequence data from a fragment consisting of\nthe second and third domain regions of the 28S rDNA gene. A key to World\ngenera of Lysitermini is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lysitermini, 28S topology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_976.phy"}]}
