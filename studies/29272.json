The identification of these\nisolates was performed using multi-locus phylogenetic analyses coupled\nwith morphological observations. Based on these data, two new genera\nwere discovered, which belong in the class Dothideomycetes.\nAcericercospora gen. nov. (Mycosphaerellaceae) is introduced to\naccommodate Acericercospora hyrcanica sp. nov., causing leaf lesions on\nAcer cappadocicum and A. velutinum. Paramycocentrospora gen. nov.\n(Dothidotthiaceae) with Paramycocentrospora acericola sp. nov. as type\nspecies, causing leaf lesions on seedlings of Acer sp., are described.\nIn this paper, detailed descriptions and illustrations are provided for\nthe new taxa, supplemented by comprehensive comparisons with allied and\nsimilar taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135164.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135163.phy"}]}
