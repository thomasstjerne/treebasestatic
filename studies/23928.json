A taxonomic study on the\nAlternaria species isolated from cabbage with leaf spot symptoms\nrevealed a previously undescribed species, which is described here as\nAlternaria persiana sp. nov. This species falls within the Alternaria\nsection Japonica based on morphological characteristics and multiple\ngene sequences analyses. The production of mostly solitary, very rarely\nin a chain containing 2-3 conidia, both from the aerial hyphae and\nhyphae growing on the surface of culture medium; conidia with wide and\ndarkened longitudinal/transverse septa; brownish-black,\nreticulate/punctate mature conidia and chlamydospore like structures\nformed from conidiophore cells distinguishes this new species from the\ntwo, previously described species in the section Japonica. Pathogenicity\ntest was done on detached cabbage leaves under In Vitro conditions and\nlesions were formed on inoculated leaves. Re-isolation of the inoculated\nfungus from the treated leaves confirmed KochÂ’s postulates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115760","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115760.phy"}]}
