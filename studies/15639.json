Phylogenetic analyses of\ncombined dataset of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd),\nAlternaria allergen a 1 (Alt a1) and calmodulin genes revealed that the\nnew isolates clustered into a subclade distinct from the closely related\nAlternaria species A. tomato and A. burnsii. The solitary or short\nchains of conidia resemble those of A. burnsii. However, conidia with\nlong beaks are morphologically similar to A. tomato. Hence, the\npathogenic fungus is proposed as Alternaria capsicicola sp. nov.\nPathogenicity assays indicated that A. capsicicola causes leaf spot on\npepper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria capsicicola gpd, Alt a1, calmodulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79659.phy"}]}
