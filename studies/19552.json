In this article, a taxonomic study based on\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analysis of ITS, nLSU, EF1-α,\nmtSSU, β-tubulin, RPB1, RPB2 and nSSU sequences was carried out. The\nphylogenetic result confirmed that species of Favolus and Neofavolus\nevolved in parallel in nature from a common ancestor. Temperature maybe\na determinate factor of distributing of Favolus and Neofavolus spp. Four\nnew species of Favolus, F. niveus, F. septatus, F. pseudoemeici and F.\nsubtropicus, are described and illustrated from China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Favolus and Neofavolus ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101035.phy"}]}
