In an attempt to delineate\ngeneric boundaries,representative strains of the various Phoma sections\nand allied coelomycetous genera wereincluded for study. Sequence data of\nthe 18S nrDNA (SSU) and the 28S nrDNA (LSU) regionsof 18 Phoma strains\nincluded were compared with those of representative strains of 39\nalliedanamorph genera, including Ascochyta, Coniothyrium, Deuterophoma,\nMicrosphaeropsis,Pleurophoma, Pyrenochaeta, and 11 teleomorph genera.\nThe type species of the Phoma sectionsPhoma, Phyllostictoides,\nSclerophomella, Macrospora and Peyronellaea grouped in a subcladein the\nPleosporales with the type species of Ascochyta and Microsphaeropsis.\nThe newfamily Didymellaceae is proposed to accommodate these Phoma\nsections and related anamorphgenera. The present study demonstrated that\nPhoma radicina, the type species ofPhoma sect. Paraphoma and Phoma\nheteromorphospora, the type species of Phoma sect. Heterosporacan be\nassigned to the Phaeosphaeriaceae and Leptosphaeriaceae\nrespectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phoma complex, MB combined SSU, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6039.phy"}]}
