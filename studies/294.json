They are flower mimics, and they greatly reduce host reproduction\nand survival. They are relatively common, attacking approximately 960\nspecies in 11 genera of crucifers as well as at least five genera of\ngrasses. In modern taxonomic treatments the Puccinia monoica complex is\ntreated as four species that are differentiated by the number of spore\nstates in their life cycles. However, other systematic treatments have\ndivided the group into species or forms based on host association.\nWithin the species based on spore state there is morphological\nvariation, but it has not been readily assignable to either host species\nor geographic area. We used DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to\ndetermine whether there are cryptic species in this group that are not\nevident when only morphology is used. We sequenced the nuclear rDNA\nregion containing the internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1+5.8S gene +\nITS-2) of isolates from different hosts. Our results indicate that there\nare cryptic species in the Puccinia monoica complex, and that species in\nthis group cannot be identified strictly by life cycle stage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crucifer rust","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1410.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"crucifer rust","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1411.phy"}]}
