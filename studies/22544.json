Shells and, as far as known,\ngenitalia of thirteen species are described and figured. Two species are\ndescribed as new to science, i.e., A. vespa n. sp. and A. enguriensis\nn. sp. The diagnostic characteristics are summarized in a table. All\nlocality records are listed and shown in distribution maps. Based on\nBayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony analyses of\nmitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences we revise the classification of\nthe genus and suggest a division into three subgenera, Iliamneme,\nAcrotomina and Acrotoma s.str. The radiation of the Acrotoma species in\nthe Pliocene and Quaternary might have been triggered by the orogenesis\nof the Greater Caucasus, which created habitats, like canyons and alpine\nenvironments, to which the Acrotoma species adapted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110843","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110843.phy"}]}
