Porri is the largest section, containing almost all\nAlternaria species with medium to large conidia and long beaks, some of\nwhich are important plant pathogens (e.g.Â Alternaria porri, A. solani\nand A. tomatophila). We constructed a multi-gene phylogeny on parts of\nthe ITS, GAPDH, RPB2, TEF1 and Alt a 1 gene regions, which, supplemented\nwith morphological and cultural studies, forms the basis for species\nrecognition in sect. Porri. Our data reveal 63 species, of which 10 are\nnewly described in sect. Porri, and 27 species names are synonymised.\nThe three known Alternaria pathogens causing early blight on tomato all\ncluster in one clade, and are synonymised under the older name, A.\nlinariae. Alternaria protenta, a species formerly only known as pathogen\non Helianthus annuus, is also reported to cause early blight of potato,\ntogether with A. solani and A. grandis. Two clades with isolates causing\npurple blotch of onion are confirmed as A. allii and A. porri, but the\ntwo species cannot adequately be distinguished based on the number of\nbeaks and branches as suggested previously. This is also found among the\npathogens of Passifloraceae, which are reduced from four to three\nspecies. In addition to the known pathogen of sweet potato, A.\nbataticola, three more species are delineated of which two are newly\ndescribed. A new Alternaria section is also described, comprising two\nlarge-spored Alternaria species with concatenate conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML ITS","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76962.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML concatenated dataset","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76961","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76961.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes GAPDH","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76960","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76960.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML TEF1","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76963.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML GAPDH","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76951","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76951.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes ITS","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76950","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76950.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes concatenated dataset","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Large-spored Alternaria pathogens in section Porri","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76949.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML RPB2","ntax":"182","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76968.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes RPB2","ntax":"182","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76967.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes Alt a 1","ntax":"181","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76965.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML Alt a 1","ntax":"181","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76966.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes TEF1","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76964","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76964.phy"}]}
