Similar Phytophthora\nspecies was isolated again from Chiba, Kanagawa and Shizuoka districts,\nuntil 2004. P. megasperma is a complex species and some new species have\nbeen segregated from this complex species. On the other hand, several\nisolates were recovered recently from leaf, petiole, runner and crown\nrot of strawberry in Hokkaido in 2005 and morphologically and\nphylogenetically considered to be a new species. All the isolates were\nre-examined based on morphological study and multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalyses including rDNA ITS regions, rDNA LSU, translation elongation\nfactor 1-Î±, Î²-tubulin and coxI genes. In the morphological study, both\nrose and strawberry isolates showed mostly similar characteristics and\nsignificantly differed from P. megasperma sensu stricto and other\nrelated Phytophthora species by its external proliferation,\ncharacteristic funnel shaped oogonia, predominantly paragynous and\nintercalary antheridia and fast growth, 10.5 mm/day at the optimum\ntemperature, 28ÂºC. In the multi-locus phylogenetic tree, they formed\ndistinct monophyletic group in clade 7 with strong bootstrap support,\nalthough there are some differences in the position of the rose and\nstrawberry isolates. The results indicate that the rose and strawberry\nisolates will be the same species consisting of two varieties and\ndesignated here as Phytophthora nagaii var. nagaii and P. nagaii var.\nfragariaefolia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65457.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 333","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67957.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67961.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67962.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67960.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 121","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67959.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora nagaii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67958.phy"}]}
