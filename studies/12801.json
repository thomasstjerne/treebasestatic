A total of 52 diverse\nisolates of Streptomyces in the soil samples were isolated on four\ndifferent media and from these 6 isolates were selected on the basis of\ncultural characteristics, microscopic and biochemical studies.\nSequencing of 16S rDNA of the selected isolates identified them to\nbelong to six different species of Streptomyces. The molecular\nmorphometric and physico-kinetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences were\nperformed to predict the diversity of the genus. The computational\nRNomics study revealed the significance of the structural RNA based\nphylogenetic analysis in a relatively diverse group of\nStreptomyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr53211","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53211.phy"}]}
