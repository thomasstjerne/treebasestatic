Many lineages of cyanobacteria thrive in these\nharsh environments, but it is not fully understood how they survive in\nthese conditions and whether they have evolved specific mechanisms of\ncold adaptation. Phormidesmis priestleyi is a cyanobacterium found\nthroughout the cold biosphere (Arctic, Antarctic and alpine habitats).\nGenome sequencing of P. priestleyi BC1401, an isolate from a cryoconite\nhole on the Greenland Ice Sheet, has allowed for the examination of\ngenes involved in cold shock response and production of extracellular\npolymeric substances (EPS). EPSs likely enable cyanobacteria to buffer\nthe effects of extreme cold and by identifying mechanisms for EPS\nproduction in P. priestleyi BC1401 this study lays the way for\ninvestigating transcription and regulation of EPS production in an\necologically important cold tolerant cyanobacterium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exopolysaccharides of Phormidesmis priestleyi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97604.phy"}]}
