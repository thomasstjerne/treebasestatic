The closely related genera\nHypleurochilus, Salaria and Scartella were also studied to ascertain\ntheir relationship with Parablennius. Phylogenetic analyses were\ncompared with morphology-based taxonomical studies. Both Salaria and\nScartella appear well supported within a clade including all\nParablennius, indicating that this genus is paraphyletic. The species\npairs P. parvicornis-P. sanguinolentus and P. gattorugine-P. ruber are\ndistant from remaining Parablennius and each forms a monophyletic group.\nTwo new genera are described for these two species pairs. Remaining\nParablennius form two distinct well-supported groups: (1) a clade of\nAtlantic-Mediterranean Parablennius (P. pilicornis, P. marmoreus, P.\nrouxi, P. salensis and P. tentacularis); (2) a clade including\nHypleurochilus, the Indo-Western Pacific Parablennius (P. cornutus, P.\nintermedius, P. tasmanianus and P. yatabei) and the Atlantic P.\nincognitus and P. zvonimiri. Use of a relaxed molecular clock suggests\nthat Indo-Pacific Parablennius originated recently from an Atlantic\nParablennius that may have dispersed via southern Africa, rather than\nvia the Mediterranean-Red Sea seaway.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51326","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51326.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51327.phy"}]}
