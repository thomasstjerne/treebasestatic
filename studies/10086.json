Yoshimi & Y.\nDoi using morphological and molecular techniques. These two species were\nidentical in both macro- and micromorphological characters, and were\nclearly different from the generally known O. asterosperma. The\nidentity of the two species and their distinctness from O.\nasterosperma was further supported by both nuclear large subunit and\nITS rDNA phylogeny. The molecular analyses also revealed that O.\ncolumellifera shares its lineage with the boletoid mushroom-forming\nXerocomus chrysenteron complex, and that it does not form a\nmonophyletic clade with other Octaviania species. Our\nmorphological reevaluation, including transmission electron microscopic\nobservation of basidiospores, clarified the taxonomic boundary between\nO. columellifera and other Japanese Octaviania species.\nAccordingly, we propose a new genus, Heliogaster, for O.\ncolumellifera with designation of the lectotype. We discuss\nphylogenetic relationships with Octaviania sensu stricto species\nand the closely related boletoid (pileate-stipitate) fungi, generic\ncharacters of Heliogaster, and intraspecific phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliogaster and Octaviania: ITS_MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5991.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 NJ","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliogaster and Octaviania: LSU_NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6261.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 ML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliogaster and Octaviania: nLSU_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6276.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliogaster and Octaviania: ITS_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6246.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 NJ","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliogaster and Octaviania: ITS_NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6053.phy"}]}
