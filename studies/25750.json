Anthracnose fruit rot\nis an important postharvest disease of loquat. However, not much is\nknown about this disease in Taiwan. In this study, the fungi causing\nanthracnose fruit rot of loquat in Taiwan were identified using\nmorphological and molecular approaches. Based on ITS sequence data,\nisolates from diseased loquat fruit, collected in the main cultivation\nareas in central Taiwan, were identified as Colletotrichum species\nbelonging to clade 2 of the C. acutatum species complex. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of the ITS, GAPDH , CHS-1 , HIS3 , ACT , and TUB2 sequences\nplaced one isolate in C. nymphaeae , while the other isolates were\ndistinct from all known Colletotrichum species and described as C.\neriobotryae sp. nov. Based on our data, both species can cause\nanthracnose fruit rot of loquat, but C. eriobotryae is the main pathogen\nof this disease in central Taiwan. The growth of both species was\ninhibited, but not completely stopped by azoxystrobin in in vitro\nassays. The growth inhibition increased by enhancing the concentration\nfrom 0.031 to 8 mg/mL and by adding salicylhydroxamic acid, suggesting\nboth species to have an alternative respiration pathway. Furthermore, C.\ncitri was revealed to be a synonym of C. nymphaeae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum acutatum clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122597.phy"}]}
