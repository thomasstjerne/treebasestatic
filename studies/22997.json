The taxon was cultured successfully\nalthough no in-vitro sporulation was observed. The new species,\nGibellula gamsii, could be distinguished from closely related other\nGibellula species on the basis of morphological features and\nphylogenetic inferences recruiting concatenated sequences of five DNA\nloci including ITS, LSU, RPB1, RPB2 and EF1-α. The secondary metabolites\nof the culture of one G. gamsii strain, BCC47868, were studied\nconcurrently after preparative separation of the crude extract by\npreparative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Two new\n1,3-disubstituted β-carboline alkaloids, for which we propose the\ntrivial names, gibellamines A (1) and B (2), were isolated. The chemical\nstructures of these compounds were elucidated by interpretation of\nspectral data, generated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n(NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The alkaloid 1 also exhibited moderate\nanti-biofilm activity against Staphylococcus aureus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gibellula gamsii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112596.phy"}]}
