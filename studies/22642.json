Despite the coralloid habit and the presence\nof skeletal hyphae, other features, notably the presence of\ngloeocystidia, dichophyses and papillate hyphal ends, differentiate this\ngenus from Pterulaceae sensu stricto. Fieldwork in Brazil resulted in\nthe rediscovery of two coralloid fungi identifiable as Parapterulicium,\nthe first verified collections of this genus since CornerÂ’s original work\nin the 1950s. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and nrLSU\nsequences from these modern specimens revealed affinities with the\n/peniophorales clade in the Russulales, rather than Pterulaceae. The\npresence of distinctive hyphal elements, homologous to the defining\nfeatures of /peniophorales, is consistent with the phylogenetic evidence\nand thus clearly distinguished Parapterulicium and its type species P.\nsubarbusculum from Pterulaceae, placing this genus within\n/peniophorales. Parapterulicium was also found to be polyphyletic so\nBaltazaria gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate P. octopodites,\nScytinostroma galactinum, S. neogalactinum and S. eurasiaticogalactinum\nalso within /peniophorales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Russulales_IQTREE","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117208","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117208.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"881","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117212","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117212.phy"}]}
