The purpose of this study was\nto use comparative genomics to provide insights into the genetic\ndiversity and evolutionary history of bacteria that produce the potent\nbotulinum neurotoxin. Results: Comparative genomic analyses of over 170\nClostridia genomes, including our draft genome assemblies for 59 newly\nsequenced Clostridia strains from six continents and publicly available\ngenomic data, provided in-depth insights into the diversity and\ndistribution of BoNT-producing bacteria. These newly sequenced strains\nincluded Group I and II strains that express BoNT/A, /B, /E, or /F as\nwell as bivalent strains. BoNT-producing Clostridia and closely related\nClostridia species were delineated with a variety of methods including\n16S rRNA gene, concatenated marker genes, core genome and concatenated\nmulti-locus sequencing typing (MLST) gene phylogenies that related whole\ngenome sequenced strains to publicly available strains and sequence\ntypes. These analyses illustrated the phylogenetic diversity in each\nGroup and the diversity of genomic backgrounds that express the same\ntoxin type or subtype. Comparisons of the botulinum neurotoxin genes did\nnot identify novel toxin types or variants. Conclusions: This study\nrepresents one of the most comprehensive analyses of whole genome\nsequence data for Group I and II BoNT-producing strains. Read data and\ndraft genome assemblies generated for 59 isolates will be a resource to\nthe research community. Core genome phylogenies proved to be a powerful\ntool for differentiating BoNT-producing strains and can provide a\nframework for the study of these bacteria. Comparative genomic analyses\nof Clostridia species illustrate the diversity of\nbotulinum-neurotoxin-producing strains and the plasticity of the genomic\nbackgrounds in which bont genes are found.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure S3 A","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NASP SNP phylogeny Group II - Alaska E43 reference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93775.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3 A","ntax":"165","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"specI concatenated marker genes phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93774.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"165","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S rRNA gene phylogeny","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S6","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botulinum neurotoxin gene phylogeny","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93776.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3 B","ntax":"165","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"kSNP phylogeny of Clostridia genomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93773.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group II concatenated MLST genes phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93777.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S1 B","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"kSNP phylogeny Group I","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93778.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S3 B","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"kSNP phylogeny Group II","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93782.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NASP SNP phylogeny Group II - Eklund 17B reference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93783.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S1 A","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NASP SNP phylogeny Group I - ATCC 15579 reference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93781.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NASP SNP phylogeny Group I - Kyoto-F reference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93780.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S2","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group I concatenated MLST genes phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93779.phy"}]}
