However, more\nthan 30 species of Mycosphaerellaceae have been associated with Sigatoka\nleaf spots of banana, and previous reports of P. musae and P. eumusae\nneed to be re-evaluated in light of recently described species. The aim\nof the present study was thus to investigate a global set of 228\nisolates of P. musae, P. eumusae and close relatives on banana using\nmultigene DNA sequence data [internal transcribed spacer regions with\nintervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit gene (rpb2), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1),\nbeta-tubulin gene (tub2), and the actin gene (act)] to confirm if these\nisolates represent P. musae, or a closely allied species. Based on these\ndata one new species is described, namely P. pseudomusae, which is\nassociated with leaf spot symptoms resembling those of P. musae on Musa\nin Indonesia. Furthermore, P. eumusae, P. musae and P. fijiensis are\nshown to be well defined taxa, with some isolates also representing P.\nlongispora. Other genera encountered in the dataset are species of\nZasmidium (Taiwan leaf speckle), Metulocladosporiella (Cladosporium leaf\nspeckle) and Scolecobasidium leaf speckle.","trees":[{"tree_label":"T2","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished parsimony tree (first of four equally most\nparsimonious trees) of the Pseudocercospora ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127804.phy"},{"tree_label":"T3","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished distance tree (HKY85) of the\nPseudocercospora act alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127805.phy"},{"tree_label":"T8","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished parsimony tree (first of two equally most\nparsimonious trees) of the Pseudocercospora act alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127806.phy"},{"tree_label":"T6","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished distance tree (HKY85) of the\nPseudocercospora rpb2 alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127809.phy"},{"tree_label":"T7","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished parsimony tree (first of twenty equally\nmost parsimonious trees) of the Pseudocercospora rpb2 alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127810.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian phylogeny calculated from the Pseudocercospora\n4-gene alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127801.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian phylogeny calculated from the Scolecobasidium\n4-gene alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127802.phy"},{"tree_label":"T1","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished distance tree (HKY85) of the\nPseudocercospora ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127803.phy"},{"tree_label":"T4","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished distance tree (HKY85) of the\nPseudocercospora tef1 alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127807.phy"},{"tree_label":"T5","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished parsimony tree (first of six equally most\nparsimonious trees) of the Pseudocercospora tef1 alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127808.phy"}]}
