While there has been\nsignificant recent progress in development of the techniques used for\nmolecular dating, many issues remain. In particular, controversies\nabound over the appropriate use and placement of fossils for calibrating\nmolecular clocks. Several methods have been proposed for evaluating\ncandidate fossils, however, few studies have compared the results\nobtained by different approaches. Moreover, no previous study has\nincorporated the effects of nucleotide saturation from different data\ntypes in the evaluation of candidate fossils. In order to address these\nissues, we compared three approaches for evaluating fossil calibrations:\nthe single-fossil cross-validation method of Near et al. (2005); the\nempirical fossil coverage method of Marshall (2008); and the Bayesian\nmulti-calibration method of Sanders and Lee (2007), and explicitly\nincorporate the effects of data type (nuclear vs. mitochondrial DNA) for\nidentifying the most reliable or congruent fossil calibrations. We used\nadvanced (Caenophidian) snakes as a case study however our results are\napplicable to any taxonomic group with multiple candidate fossils,\nprovided appropriate taxon sampling and sufficient molecular sequence\ndata are available. We found that data type strongly influenced which\nfossil calibrations were identified as outliers, regardless of which\nmethod was used. Despite the use of complex partitioned models of\nsequence evolution and multiple calibrations throughout the tree,\nsaturation severely compressed basal branch lengths obtained from\nmitochondrial DNA compared with nuclear DNA. The effects of\nmitochondrial saturation were not ameliorated by analysing a combined\nnuclear and mitochondrial dataset. While removing the third codon\npositions from the mitochondrial coding regions did not ameliorate\nsaturation effects in the single-fossil cross-validations, it did in the\nBayesian multi-calibration analyses. Saturation significantly influenced\nthe fossils that were selected as most reliable for all three methods\nevaluated. Our findings highlight the need to critically evaluate the\nfossils selected by data with different rates of nucleotide substitution\nand how data with different evolutionary rates affect the results of\neach method for evaluating fossils. Our empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates that the advantages of using multiple independent fossil\ncalibrations significantly outweigh any disadvantages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mtDNA no Third SetD","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31151.phy"},{"tree_label":"CalibrationSetA","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibration SetA","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibration SetB","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31146.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibration SetD","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31147.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtDNA no Third SetA","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31148.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtDNA no Third SetB","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31149.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtDNA no Third SetC","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenophidian Snakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31150.phy"}]}
