These endemic and native plant species are being threatened\nby both native and introduced Phytophthora species. Through the Cape\nCitizen Science Programme, several surveys were conducted between\n2014-2019 to catalogue the diversity of Phytophthora species associated\nwith this region. During the baiting of the soil samples collected\nduring these surveys, we recovered several already described species\nalong with six isolates of Phytophthora sp. emzansi and three isolates\nof another Phytophthora species which morphologically resembled ITS\nClade 10 taxa. In the present study, we conducted multi-gene\nphylogenetic analyses using complete Internal Transcribed Spacer along\nwith partial cytochrome oxidase I, B-tubulin and heat shock protein 90\ncoupled microscopic investigation to revised the taxonomy of P. sp.\nemzansi and describe our newly recovered Phytophthora species. As\npredicted previously P. sp. emzansi for a monophyletic lineage with the\nITS Clade 2 species and sister taxon to P. capensis. Our newly\nrecovered Phytophthora species forms an independent lineage within the\nITS Clade 10b species and phylogenetically close to P.\nintercalaris and P. gallica. ","trees":[{"tree_label":"Clade2.HSP90.PhEmzansi","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122358","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122358.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade2.ITS.PhEmzansi","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122359.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade10.ITS.PhHansenii","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122350","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade10.BTUB.PhHansenii","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122351","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade10.COI.PhHansenii","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122352","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade10.HSP90.PhHansenii","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122353","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122353.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade2.COI.PhEmzansi","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122356","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122356.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade2.BTUB.PhEmzansi","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122355","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122355.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade10.CONCAT.PhHansenii","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122354","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122354.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade2.CONCAT.PhEmzansi","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122357","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122357.phy"}]}
