Here, we deduced the phylogeny\nof three groups of Archaeplastida and Haptophyta on the basis of\nsequences of the slowly evolving multiple nuclear genes and reduced the\ngaps or missing data, especially in glaucophyte operational taxonomic\nunits (OTUs). The present multigene phylogenetic analyses resolved that\nHaptophyta and two groups of Chromalveolata, stramenopiles and\nAlveolata, form a monophyletic group that is sister to the green plants\nand that the glaucophytes and red algae are basal to the clade composed\nof green plants and Chromalveolata. The bootstrap values supporting\nthese phylogenetic relationships increased with the exclusion of\nlong-branched OTUs. The close relationship between green plants and\nChromalveolata is further supported by the common replacement in two\nplastid-targeted genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glaucophyta, green plants, and Haptophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6230.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glaucophyta, green plants, and Haptophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6093.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glaucophyta, green plants, and Haptophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6615.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glaucophyta, green plants, and Haptophyta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6259.phy"}]}
