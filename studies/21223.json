F and Dendrobium nobile Lindl. in Guangxi and\nJiangxi province of southern China, based on a polyphasic\ncharacterization including host, morphology, and molecular phylogeny.\nThe phylogenetic analysis was conducted based on the ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), large subunit 28S rRNA (LSU), actin (ACT),\npartial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1), and\nglyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) gene regions. Our study\nconfirms the phylogenetic distinctions of the two new species, as well\nas their phenotypic differences with known species in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106968.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106969","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106969.phy"}]}
