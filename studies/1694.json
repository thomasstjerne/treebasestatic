Morphological analyses retrieved 84 trees poorly supported by\nhomoplastic characters and resolved the seven species of Basiphyllaea in\na clade sustained by four synapomorphic characters. Molecular and\ncombined analyses retrieved almost identical trees in which the species\nof Bletia are in a clade with no support. Results indicate that in\nsubtribe Bletiinae there is a trend from achlorophyllous plants lacking\nleaves to chlorophyllous plants with tuberoid stems with small shoots\nand conduplicate leaves to plants with plicate leaves with vertical\ncorms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS consensus","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4724.phy"},{"tree_label":"combined tree","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4720.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-trnL 3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4721.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-trnL 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4722.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-trnL 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4723.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict morphology","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4725.phy"}]}
