We used a molecular\nphylogenetic approach to investigate the degree of host specialization\nof cyanobacteria associated with four closely related species of the\nlichenized fungus Peltigera and to compare these strains to other\nsymbiotic cyanobacteria. We conducted phylogenetic analyses on 16S,\nrbcLX, and trnL sequences from cyanobacteria associated with multiple\nspecimens of each lichen species and from symbionts of other fungi and\nplants, as well as from free-living strains of Nostoc and related genera\nof cyanobacteria. The genus Nostoc comprises two divergent lineages, but\nsymbiotic strains occur primarily within a single monophyletic lineage\nthat also included free-living representatives. Cyanobacteria from the\nsame lichen species were often more closely related to strains from\nother species or to plant symbionts or free-living strains than to each\nother. These results indicate that host specialization is low for the\ngenus Nostoc, and suggest that opportunities for coevolution with its\npartners may be rare.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiotic Cyanobacteria, trnL nos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_495.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiotic Cyanobacteria, rbcLX nonsym","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiotic Cyanobacteria, rbcLX nos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4573.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiotic Cyanobacteria, 16S nonsym","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4570.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symbiotic Cyanobacteria, 16S nos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4572.phy"}]}
