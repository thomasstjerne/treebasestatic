For\nexample, Olacaceae contain parasites and nonparasites, climbing lianas\nand trees, and members with dichlamydous and monochlamydous perianths.\nThis family is basalmost in the sandalwood order (Santalales), thus it\nrepresents the staging ground for many innovations that evolved in\nsubsequent groups. The present molecular phylogenetic study has obtained\nDNA sequence data (nuclear SSU rDNA and chloroplast rbcL and matK) for\nall but two of the 28 genera in this group. Maximum parsimony and\nBayesian analyses have resolved seven clades, well-supported by\nmolecular and morphological characters. Root hemiparasitism appears to\nhave first evolved in the clade containing Ximenia whereas clades\nbetween that one and the outgroup appear to be entirely\nautotrophic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basal Santalales MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basal Santalales BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1028.phy"}]}
