Appendiculati) are\nan economically important group of ectomycorrhizal fungi whose\nbasidiocarps have a yellow tube layer that often bruises blue, yellow\nreticulate stipe, mild taste, and firm yellow-tinged flesh that may or\nmay not blue when exposed. We use morphological characters and molecular\ndata (ITS and LSU) to establish a new genus, Butyriboletus, to\naccommodate 15 species of butter boletes that range around the northern\nhemisphere from Asia to Europe, North Africa and North America. We\nrecombine eight previously described butter bolete species and we\ndescribe seven new species: four from California, USA and three from\nYunnan, China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61823.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61825.phy"}]}
