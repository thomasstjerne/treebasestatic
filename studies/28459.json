Recent phylogenetic\ninvestigations resulted in a taxonomic lumping approach with the\nFloricolaceae and its genera being synonymized under the earlier family\nname, Teichosporaceae. Intergeneric relationships were therefore obsure\nand which morphs are phylogenetically significant in species delineation\nwarranted further studies. We here taxonomically revise the family\nTeichosporaceae based on both morphology and phylogenetic evidence. Type\nor representative specimens of Teichosporaceae were loaned and fresh\nspecimens were collected from China and Thailand. Maximum likelihood and\nBayesian analyses of a combined ITS, LSU, SSU, tef1-Î± and rpb2 dataset\nwere performed to clarify the phylogenetic affinities of the taxa. The\nbroad genus concept of Teichospora is dismissed based on morphological\ndissimilarities and phylogenetic relationships among the genera. We\naccept Asymmetrispora, Aurantiascoma, Floricola, Magnibotryascoma,\nMisturatosphaeria, Pseudoaurantiascoma, Pseudomisturatosphaeria,\nRamusculicola and Teichospora as distinct genera in the Teichosporaceae.\nAll recognized genera are phenotypically characterized and\nphylogenetically well-supported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132006","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132006.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132007.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132008.phy"}]}
