{"Authors":" Jeremy Catalin Andersen, Nicholas J Mills","Year":" 2012","Title":" DNA extraction from museum specimens of parasitic\nHymenoptera","Journal":" PLoS ONE","Volume":" 7","Issue":" 10","Pages":" e45549","Keywords":" ancient DNA, Insect Museum, Braconidae, Trioxys, Metoerus,\nAtanycolus","DOI":" 10.1371/journal.pone.0045549","Abstract":" At the same time that molecular researchers are improving\ntechniques to extract DNA from museum specimens, this increased demand\nfor access to museum specimens has created tension between the need to\npreserve specimens for maintaining collections and morphological\nresearch and the desire to conduct molecular analyses. To address these\nconcerns, we examined the suitability of non-invasive DNA extraction\ntechniques on three species of parasitic Hymenoptera (Braconidae), and\ntest the effects of body size (parasitoid species), age (time since\ncollection), and DNA concentration from each extract on the probability\nof amplifying meaningful fragments of two commonly used genetic loci. We\nfound that age was a significant factor for determining the probability\nof success for sequencing both 28S and COI fragments. While the size of\nthe braconid parasitoids significantly affected the total amount of\nextracted DNA, neither size nor DNA concentration were significant\nfactors for the amplification of either gene region. We also tested\nseveral primer combinations of various lengths, but were unable to\namplify fragments longer than ,150 base pairs. These short fragments of\n28S and COI were however sufficient for species identification, and for\nthe discovery of within species genetic variation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Atanycolus MP Tree
