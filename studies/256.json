The results confirm\nprevious findings that Lycopersicon and Cyphomandra are derived from\nwithin Solanum. Three out of four Solanum subgenera with more than one\nrepresentative in this analysis (Minon, Potatoe, Solanum) are found to\nbe polyphyletic, suggesting that the subgeneric classification of the\ngenus needs revision. Subgenus Leptostemonum is monophyletic within the\ncontext of our sampling. Three primary clades can be distinguished\nwithin Solanum. Clade I includes representatives of sections\nArchaesolanum, Dulcamara, Holophylla, Jasminosolanum, and Solanum. Clade\nII includes members of subgenus Potatoe (sections Basarthrum,\nLycopersicon, and Petota). Clade III includes all representatives\nsampled from subg. Leptostemonum, sects. Allophyllum, Brevantherum,\nGeminata, Pseduocapsicum, and Cyphomandropsis, and the genus\nCypohomandra. Solanum as a whole and each of the three primary clades\napppear to be New World in origin. Within Leptostemonum, African and\nAustralian members are derived from New World ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1316.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1317.phy"}]}
