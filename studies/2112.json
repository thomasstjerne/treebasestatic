This result is supported\nby ITS and nLSU-rDNA sequences with strong measures of branch support,\nin addition to several morphological and ecological similarities. An\ninclusive ITS study was performed using a mixed model Bayesian analysis\nthat suggests the derived status of Anamika within Hebeloma, thereby\nrendering Hebeloma a paraphyletic genus. However, the monophyly of\nHebeloma cannot be rejected outright given ITS and nLSU-rDNA data. Thus,\nwe propose two new Asian species in Anamika : A. angustilamellata sp.\nnov. from dipterocarp and fagaceous forests of southwestern China and\nnorthern Thailand ; and A. lactariolens comb. nov., a Japanese species\noriginally described in the genus Alnicola. A complete description of A.\nangustilamellata, including illustrations, is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anamika","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3080.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anamika","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3079.phy"}]}
