This is the first\nidentification of caryophyllaceous anther smuts in the Outer Hebrides\naccording to modern species concepts and the first report of\nMicrobotryum silenes-acaulis confirmed by molecular analysis from the\nBritish Isles. Additionally, the genetic structure of Microbotryum\nsilenes-acaulis, based on all currently available ITS sequences, is\nanalysed and discussed. Seven ITS genotypes are determined for\nMicrobotryum silenes-acaulis, including three genotypes in North America\nand four genotypes in Europe. Compared to European accessions, all North\nAmerican accessions share specific nucleotides and are genetically\ndivergent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Outer Hebrides Microbotryum silenes acaulis ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103975.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microbotryum hebrides ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103974.phy"}]}
