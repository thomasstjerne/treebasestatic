There are two types of polyploidy, autopolyploidy genome\nduplication within a species and allopolyploidy, whole genome\nduplication coupled with hybridization. Penstemon subsection Saccanthera\nis a species complex of closely related diploids and polyploids. The\nspecies in this complex are P. heterophyllus (2x, 4x), P. parvulus (4x),\nP. neotericus (8x), P. laetus (2x) and P. azureus (6x). Previous studies\nhave hypothesized that P. azureus is an allopolyploid of P. parvulus\n(4x) X P. laetus (2x). To test the hypothesis of allopolyploidy in the\norigin of P. azureus and to determine possible progenitors two nuclear\nloci (Adh & NIA) and three chloroplast spacer regions (trnD-trnT,\nrpoB-trnC, rpl32-trnL) were sequenced from P. azureus, P. heterophyllus,\nP. laetus, P. parvulus, and P. neotericus. These data were analyzed in a\nphylogenetic framework and a network analysis was used on the nuclear\ndata. Both nuclear datasets supported the allopolyploid origin of P.\nazureus with divergent Adh orthologs recovered in all five accessions of\nP. azureus and divergent NIA orthologs recovered in three of the P.\nazureus accessions. Furthermore, the Adh and NIA datasets support three\nhypotheses for the possible progenitors of P. azureus: (1) P.\nheterophyllus (2x) X P. parvulus; (2) P. heterophyllus (4x) X P. laetus;\nand (3) P. heterophyllus (2x) X P. heterophyllus (4x). Markedly, all\nhypotheses support P. heterophyllus (2x) as a progenitor. In addition,\nthe Adh and NIA trees also suggest that P. neotericus is an\nallopolyploid, P. parvulus is an autopolyploid with two distinct\norigins, and P. heterophyllus (4x) is an autopolyploid or allopolyploid.\nThe cpDNA analysis resolved geographically structured clades. This\npattern seems best explained by local adaptation of the chloroplast\ngenome and chloroplast capture. However, multiple origins of the\npolyploid species and gene flow could also explain this pattern. This\nstudy provides the first molecular phylogenetic evidence of the\nallopolyploid origin of P. azureus and has given insight into the origin\nof the other polyploids in this species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP8","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94882","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94882.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94883","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94883.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94884.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP6","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penstemon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94573.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94605.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP13","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94574","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94574.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94668.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penstemon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94669.phy"}]}
