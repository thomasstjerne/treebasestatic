However, due to the\nmorphological complexity and the limited phylogenetic information on the\nvarious species and genera of this fungal family, our understanding of\nits systematics and evolution remains rudimentary. In this study, DNA\nsequences of four genes (nrLSU, tef1-Î±, rpb1, and rpb2) were newly\nobtained from ca. 200 representative specimens of Boletaceae. Our\nphylogenetic analyses revealed seven major clades at the subfamily\nlevel, namely Austroboletoideae, Boletoideae, Chalciporoideae,\nLeccinoideae, Xerocomoideae, Zangioideae, and the Pulveroboletus Group.\nIn addition, 59 genus-level clades were identified, of which 22 were\nuncovered for the first time. These 22 clades were mainly placed in\nBoletoideae and the Pulveroboletus Group. The results further indicated\nthat the characters frequently used in the morphology-based taxonomy of\nBoletaceae, such as basidiospore ornamentation, the form of the\nbasidioma, and the stuffed pores each had multiple origins within the\nfamily, suggesting that the use of such features for high-level\nclassification of Boletaceae should be de-emphasized and combined with\nother characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"290","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78390.phy"}]}
