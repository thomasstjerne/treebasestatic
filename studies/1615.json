In the Saxifraga rivularis\ncomplex (2n = 26, 52), the number of species accepted ranges from a\nsingle polymorphic one (S. rivularis s.l.) to several (the circumpolar\nS. hyperborea, the amphi-Atlantic S. rivularis, the three amphi-Pacific\nspecies S. bracteata, S. flexuosa and S. arctolitoralis, and S. debilis\nin the Rocky Mountains). A combination of molecular (AFLPs), flow\ncytometrical, and morphological data from samples covering most of the\ndistribution range was used to delimit taxonomic species and to unravel\ntheir evolutionary relationships. Four lineages with distinct\nmorphological differences were recognized, representing four species:\nthe diploids S. bracteata, S. hyperborea (including S. flexuosa), and S.\ndebilis, and the tetraploid S. rivularis (including S. arctolitoralis).\nBased on a synthesis of the available data we provide a taxonomic\nrevision of the complex and propose one rank change (S. rivularis subsp.\narctolitoralis comb. nov.). Genome sizes as well as the intermediate\nposition of the S. rivularis lineage in the molecular and morphological\nanalyses suggest a single allopolyploid origin from the S. bracteata and\nthe S. hyperborea lineages, most likely in Beringia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga rivularis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_727.phy"}]}
