These data strongly supported the\nderived position of Hectorella within a clade consisting of Western\nAmerican members of Portulacaceae; the sister group of Hectorella was a\nclade including Montia, Claytonia and Lewisia. Implications for taxonomy\nare discussed; in order to accomodate monophyly in tribal-level\nclassification while preserving current tribes Montieae and Lewiseae,\nthe new tribe Hectorelleae is proposed for the family\nPortulacaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hectorella rbcL MP strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2366.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hectorella ndhF ML Tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2364.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hectorella matK MP strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2365.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hectorella ndhF MP Strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2363.phy"}]}
