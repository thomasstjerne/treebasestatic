Eleven isolates were\nrecovered from Castanea sativa, in areas severely affected by chestnut\nblight and eleven isolates from Quercus suber in areas with cork oak\ndecline. These isolates were compared with known C. parasitica and\nCryphonectria radicalis isolates using an integrated approach comprising\nmorphological, and molecular methods. Morphologically the atypical\nisolates were more similar to C. radicalis than to C. parasitica.\nPhylogenetic analyses based on ITS and β-tubulin sequence data grouped\nthe isolates in a well-supported clade separate from C. radicalis.\nCombining morphological, cultural and molecular data Cryphonetria\nnaterciae is newly described in the Cryphonectria-Endothia complex.\nMicrosatellite-primed PCR fingerprinting with (GACA)4 primer\ndiscriminated between C. naterciae C. radicalis, and C. parasitica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Combined","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46893","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46893.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_NJ","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46894","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46894.phy"}]}
