The two gene\nphylogenies concurred that section Cyclostigma sensu Webster is\npolyphyletic, with its members appearing in nine different clades\nthroughout Croton. The clade that retains the taxonomic type of the\nsection and about half of the species sampled is redefined here as a\nreduced, monophyletic section Cyclostigma, and the remaining species are\nplaced in other sections or informal clades. The ITS and chloroplast\nphylogenies are discordant regarding the position of the redefined\nsection Cyclostigma suggesting that reticulate evolution might have\nplayed a role in the evolutionary history of this group. These results\nhighlight that the tree habit has evolved on multiple occasions in\nCroton, and that there are other morphological characters that can\neffectively distinguish different tree lineages in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Croton, Cyc ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Croton, Cyc trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3101.phy"}]}
