The three new species are\ncharacterized by small to medium size, white or brown, adnate to\nsubdecurrent lamellae, pubescentstips with fibrils at bases, four-spore\nbasidia, amyloid spore, numerous cheilocystidia with various shapes and\npileipellis with short, simple or diverticulate excrescences. These\ncharacteristics are congruent to those of Mycena section Fragilipedes.\nPhylogenetic tree showed that M. venus, M. luguensis, and M. jingyinga\nhad the closest relationships to M. plumbea, M. haematopus, and M.\nabrambii, respectively. The details of morphological and phylogenetic\ndifferences among the three new species and the other similar species\nare discussed. The three new species bring the total of bioluminescent\nmushrooms to 96 and 15 species in the world and Taiwan,\nrespectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree inferred from Bayesian algorithm\nbased on ITS sequences.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree inferred from Bayesian algorithm\nbased on RPB2 sequences.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_113054.phy"}]}
