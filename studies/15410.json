This study\ninvestigated the systematics of Endoraecium from 55 specimens in\nAustralia based on a combined morphological and molecular approach.\nPhylogenetic analyses were conducted on partitioned datasets of loci\nfrom ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA. The recovered molecular phylogeny\nsupported a recently published taxonomy based on morphology and host\nrange that divided Endoraecium digitatum into five species. Spore\nmorphology is synapomorphic and there is evidence Endoraecium co-evolved\nwith its Acacia hosts. The broad host ranges of E. digitatum, E. parvum,\nE. phyllodiorum and E. violae-faustiae are revised in light of this\nstudy, and nine new species of Endoraecium are described from Australia\nbased on host taxonomy, morphology and phylogenetic concordance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endoraecium RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70627.phy"}]}
