Taxonomic identity of this fungal morph\nhas long intrigued mycologists starting from M. J. Berkeley who named it\nas Sclerotium stipitatum Berk. & Curr. in 1860. Its unique\nmorphology and total lack of spores of any kind defied proper\nidentification. Molecular phylogenetic methods unequivocally prove that\na nilamanga specimen that we obtained recently from Kerala is a Xylaria\nspecies sharing 99% sequence similarity with X. acuminatilongissima, a\ntermite associated species first reported from Taiwan. The hypogeal\norigin of nilamanga specimens indicate that they could very well be\ngrowing on abandoned subterranean termite nests. The sterile structures\ncan be considered as a morphologically variable, multihyphal aggregated\nsclerotial stage of the fungus that can remain dormant or quiescent when\nthe environment is unfavourable.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylaria NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95517.phy"}]}
