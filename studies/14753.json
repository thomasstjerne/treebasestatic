A new genus, Pseudophialophora is erected to\naccommodate three species, which is characterized by slow growth on\npotato dextrose agar, curved conidiogenous cells without a conspicuous\ncollarette apex, and oblong ellipsoidal conidia. Pseudophialophora\neragrostidis, P. panicorum and P. schizachyrii are assigned to this\ngenus. A new species of Magnaporthiopsis is also reported and named as\nM. panicorum. Distinctions between them and phylogenetic relationships\nwith other Magnaporthaceae taxa are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66834.phy"}]}
