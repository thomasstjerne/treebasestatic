The phylogenetic study for all isolates involved the\ncombination of genes translation elongation factor-1α (tef1), rpb2 and\ncal for 12 selected isolates. GCPSR criteria were used for the\nrecognition of species; morphological and cultural characters was\nperformed allowing for the identification of taxa. Results presented\nherein revealed a previously unrecorded wealth of Trichoderma species in\nCoffea spp. and in connection with coffee leaf rust. Sixteen species\nwere identified during a survey. These included Trichoderma agressivum,\nT. andinense, T. atroviride, T. guizhouense, T. hamatum, T.\nkoningiopsis, T. lentiforme, T. parareesei, T. petersenii, T. spirale,\nT. theobromicola and T. virens. Additionally, four novel Trichoderma\ntaxa were found and are described in the present work. The true\npotential of such Trichoderma isolates for the coffee plants in terms of\npossible physiological benefits but, in particular as a tool to protect\n(fungal bodyguards) coffee plantations against its worst disease (CLR)\nwill be investigated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117062.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117063.phy"}]}
