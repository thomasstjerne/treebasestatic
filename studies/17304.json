Its most distinctive morphological features are asci and\nascospores that are distinctly longer than those of other Rhytisma\nspecies on Salix. rDNA ITS and LSU sequence analyses also indicate that\nthis fungus is sufficiently distinct from other Rhytisma species to\njustify new species status.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhytisma filamentosum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86792.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhytisma filamentosum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86791.phy"}]}
