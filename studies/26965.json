Boletaceae subfamily\nChalciporoideae was re-circumscribed to include the new genus\nNevesoporus. Specimens of the new taxa were collected in the Atlantic\nForest of eastern Brazil, an endangered, globally important biome for\ntropical biodiversity. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using a\nmulti-locus dataset (ITS+28S+TEF1+RPB1+RPB2) from a large taxon set\nacross the Boletaceae justify erection of the new genera.\nMacromorphological, micromorphological, habitat, and multilocus DNA\nsequence data are provided for the new species. A key to the known\nnative and introduced bolete species from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest\nis provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"246","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132587","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132587.phy"},{"tree_label":"new con 50 majrule","ntax":"329","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135068.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"246","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132588","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132588.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"219","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126369.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"219","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126370.phy"}]}
