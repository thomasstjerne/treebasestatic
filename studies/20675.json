Ferns\ncomprise a major terrestrial plant radiation with an extensive\nevolutionary history providing a wealth of modern and fossil data for\nmodelling environmental drivers of diversi cation. Here we develop a\nnovel Bayesian model to simultaneously estimate correlations between\ndiversi cation dynamics and multiple environmental trajectories. We\nestimate the impact of di erent factors on fern diversi cation over the\npast 400 million years by analysing a comprehensive dataset of fossil\noccurrences and complement these ndings by analysing a large molecular\nphylogeny. We show that origination and extinction rates are governed by\nfundamentally di erent processes: originations depend on within-group\ndiversity but are largely una ected by environmental changes, whereas\nextinctions are strongly a ected by external factors such as climate and\ngeology. Our results indicate that the prime driver of fern diversity\ndynamics is environmentally driven extinction, with origination being an\nopportunistic response to diminishing ecospace occupancy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"1118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fern diversification patterns BEAST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102654.phy"}]}
