The objective of this study was to identify\nspecies of Lasiodiplodia associated with dieback and stem-end rot of\nmango in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil, and compare the\nspecies in relation to mycelial growth, pathogenicity and virulence. A\ntotal of 120 isolates of Lasiodiplodia were used and identifications\nwere made using a combination of morphology and phylogenetic analysis\nbased on partial translation elongation factor 1-Î± sequence (EF1-Î±)\nand internal transcribed spacers (ITS). The following species were\nidentified: Lasiodiplodia crassispora, L. egyptiacae, L. hormozganensis,\nL. iraniensis, L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae and L. viticola.\nLasiodiplodia theobromae was the most frequently isolated species, which\nrepresented 41% of all the isolates. Only this species had been\npreviously reported on mango in Brazil, while the other species\nrepresent the first report associated with the mango tree diseases in\nthis country. Lasiodiplodia crassispora and L. viticola are reported for\nthe first time associated with the mango diseases worldwide. There were\nsignificant differences in mycelial growth rates among the Lasiodiplodia\nspecies and also in the optimum temperature for growth. All species of\nLasiodiplodia were pathogenic on mango fruit. There were significant\ndifferences in virulence among the species, wherein L. viticola and L.\nhormozganensis were the most virulent, while the least virulent were L.\niraniensis, L. pseudotheobromae, L. crassispora and L. egyptiacae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
