The morphological features of\nthese new isolates were substantially different to those presented in\nthe original description of P. alti- cola, but identical to an\nex-paratype isolate (CBS 121939) of that species. The original\ndescription of P. alticola was likely based on mixed cultures and has\nbeen previously recognised as nomen dubium. In order to clarify this\nconfusion, we have designated a neotype and emended P. alticola based on\nthese new collections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99741.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99740","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99740.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora umhlaba concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123366.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99742","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99742.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99743","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99743.phy"}]}
