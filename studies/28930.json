In the traditional\ncircumscription the genus is polyphyletic, and the monotypic family\nCerinomycetaceae is paraphyletic. Aiming for a more concise\ndelimitation, we revise Cerinomyces s.l. with a novel phylogeny based on\nsequences of nrDNA (SSU, ITS, LSU) and protein-coding genes (RPB1, RPB2,\nTEF1-α). We establish that monophyletic Cerinomyces s.s. is best\ncharacterized not by the corticioid morphology, but by a combination of\ntraits: hyphal clamps, predominantly aseptate thin-walled basidiospores,\nand low content of carotenoid pigments. In our updated definition,\nCerinomyces s.s. encompasses five well-supported phylogenetic clades\ndivided into two morphological groups: (i-iii) taxa with arid corticioid\nbasidiocarps, including the generic type C. pallidus; and (iv-v) newly\nintroduced members with gelatinous basidiocarps, like Dacrymyces enatus\nand D. tortus. The remaining corticioid species of Cerinomyces s.l. are\nmorphologically distinct and belong to Dacrymycetaceae. Our analysis\nplaces the carotenoid-rich Cerinomyces canadensis close to Femsjonia\n(Dacrymycetaceae). We transfer clamps-lacking C. grandinioides group to\nDacrymyces. In addition, we address genera related to Cerinomyces s.l.\nhistorically, such as Ceracea, or morphologically, like Dacryonaema and\nUnilacryma. All in all, we describe twenty-four new species and propose\nnine new combinations in both Cerinomycetaceae and Dacrymycetaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cer0 bor BI","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerinomyces borealis clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134225.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 pal BI","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerinomyces pallidus subclade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134229.phy"},{"tree_label":"dactes BI","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134235.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 bor ML","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134224.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 ena ML","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134227.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 pal ML","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134228.phy"},{"tree_label":"dactes ML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134234","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134234.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 tor BI","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerinomyces tortus clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134231.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 alb ML","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134223.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 alb BI","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerinomyces albosporus clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134222.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 ena BI","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerinomyces enatus clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134226.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer0 tor ML","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134230.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer2 ML","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134232","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134232.phy"},{"tree_label":"cer2 BI","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymyces grandinioides clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134233.phy"}]}
