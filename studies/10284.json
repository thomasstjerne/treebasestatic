One such family is the Meliaceae. Here we infer the\nhistory of the neotropical Meliaceae genus Cedrela (17 species), the\nsister clade of which today is restricted to tropical Asia. Sequences\nfrom the nuclear ribosomal spacer region and five plastid loci obtained\nfor all ingroup species and relevant outgroups were used to infer\nspecies relationships and for molecular-clock dating under two Bayesian\nrelaxed clock models. The clock models differed in their handling of\nrate autocorrelation and sets of fossil constraints. Results suggest\nthat (1) crown group diversification in Cedrela started in the\nOligocene/Early Miocene and intensified in the Late Miocene and Early\nPliocene, and (2) Central American Cedrela species do not form a clade,\nimplying reentry into Central America after the closure of the\nPanamanian Isthmus. At present, Cedrela is distributed in both dry and\nhumid habitats, but morphological features suggest an origin in dry\nforest under seasonal climates, fitting with Miocene and Pliocene\nCedrela fossils from deciduous forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cedrela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6910.phy"}]}
