We present a molecular phylogeny\nincluding the aplacophorans Neomeniomorpha (Solenogastres) and\nChaetodermomorpha (Caudofoveata). Our analysis recovered instead the\nclade Aculifera (Aplacophora + Polyplacophora). A relaxed Bayesian\nmolecular clock estimates an Early Ordovician appearance of the\naculiferan crown group. This is consistent with the presence of\nchiton-like molluscs (paleoloricates) with seven or eight dorsal shell\nplates, interpreted to be ancestral to both chitons and aplacophorans,\nin the Late Cambrian (~501-490 million years ago). Molecular,\nembryological and palaeontological data indicate that the aplacophorans\nevolved from chiton-like ancestors. The recovery of cephalopods as a\nsistergroup to aculiferans suggests that the plesiomorphic condition in\nmolluscs might be a morphology similar to monoplacophoran limpets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aplacophorans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46103.phy"}]}
