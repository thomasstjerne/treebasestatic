The family is distinguished by having\npycnidial conidiomata with brown, furfuraceous margins, brown conidia\nwith hyaline, tube-like basal appendages, longitudinal striations, and\nrhexolytic secession. Six species occurring on Eucalyptus are newly\nintroduced, namely H. australiensis, H. ellipsoidea, H.\npseudohawaiiensis, and H. ravenstreetina from Australia, H. kleinzeeina\nfrom South Africa, and H. viterboensis from Italy. Epitypes are\ndesignated for H. spermatoidea and H. weresubiae, both also occurring on\nEucalyptus. Members of Harknessia are commonly associated with leaf\nspots, but also occur as saprobes and endophytes in leaves and twigs of\nvarious angiosperm hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Harknessiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52236.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Harknessiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52237.phy"}]}
