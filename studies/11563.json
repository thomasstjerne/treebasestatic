Research conducted mostly in Canada\nindicates that this disease is primarily caused by Fusarium lactis\nPirotta. Ninety-eight Fusarium isolates obtained from diseased sweet\npeppers from Belgium, as well as from other countries (Canada, the\nNetherlands and the United Kingdom) were identified by sequencing the\ntranslation elongation factor 1α (EF). Of these 98 isolates, 13 were\nidentified as F. oxysporum Schltdl., nine as F. proliferatum (Matsush.)\nNirenberg and two belonged to clade 3 of the F. solani species complex.\nOf the 74 remaining isolates, the EF sequence showed 97% to 98%\nsimilarity to F. lactis. Of these isolates, the β-tubulin (TUB),\ncalmodulin (CAM) and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II\n(RPB2) genes were also sequenced. Analysis of the combined sequences\nrevealed that the 74 isolates share nine combined sequences that\ncorrespond to nine multilocus sequence types (STs), while the F. lactis\nneotype strain and one other strain, both isolated from figs, form a\nseparate ST. Together, these 10 STs represent a monophyletic F. lactis\nspecies complex (FLASC). An unusually high level of genetic diversity\nwas observed between (groups of) these STs. Two of them (ST5 and ST6)\nfulfilled the criteria for species recognition based on genealogical\nexclusivity and together represent a new monophyletic species lineage\n(FLASC-1). The seven other STs, togetherwith the F. lactis neotype ST,\nform a paraphyletic species lineage in the African clade of the\nGibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC). From each of the 10 STs,\nthe mycotoxin production was assessed using a multi-mycotoxin liquid\nchromatography mass spectrometry method. Out of the 27 analyzed\nmycotoxins, beauvericin and fumonisins were detected in sweet pepper\ntissue and in maize kernels. The 10 STs clearly differed in the amount\nof mycotoxin produced, but there was only limited congruence between the\nproduction profile and the phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, the\nmorphological characterization (based on mycelial growth rate and the\nlength of macroconidia) showed distinct differences between the 10 STs,\nbut again there was limited congruence with the phylogenetic results. In\nconclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrate that 75% of the\nisolates obtained from sweet pepper with internal fruit rot belong to a\nF. lactis species complex (FLASC), including a new FLASC-1 monophyletic\nspecies, and that the members of this complex display great genetic and\nphenotypic diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47072.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47083.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47082.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47081.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47080.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47079.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47077.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47076.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47075.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47074.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium lactis and Gibberella fujikuroi species\ncomplex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47073.phy"}]}
