The 650-700 species are distributed in Eurasia\nand North America; exceptions are three species on the tropical African\nMts. Maximum likelihood analyses of 2088 aligned nucleotides of plastid\nand nuclear sequences obtained from 188 accessions of Delphinieae from\nthroughout the geographic range (plus relevant outgroups) show that\nAconitum is nested within Delphinium and that three short-lived (annual\nor biennial) Mediterranean species belonging to Delphinium subgenus\nStaphisagria are the sister clade to all other Delphinieae. Ancestral\nstate reconstructions and molecular clock dating imply that the Early\nOligocene ancestor of the mostly perennial Delphinieae was an annual or\na biennial. Via the Beringian corridor, Aconitum entered North America\nc. 3.3 Ma ago and Delphinium c. 2.9 Ma ago; Delphinium also reached the\nEast African Mts. at 2.4 Ma ago, during the major uplift experienced by\nthe East African Rift system. Late Miocene bursts in diversification\nrates in the Himalayan and South-Western Chinese clades of Aconitum and\nDelphinium are associated with transitions from annual to perennial or\npseudo-annual growth.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"191","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47872.phy"}]}
