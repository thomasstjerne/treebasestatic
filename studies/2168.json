Section\nLimniris is polyphyletic as currently delineated because series Spuriae,\nFoetidissimae, Syriacae, Longipetalae, Vernae, Unguiculares, and some\nelements of Tenuifoliae are placed outside of the core group of Limniris\nspecies. The most inclusive monophyletic clade of Limniris species\nincludes the series Californicae, Sibericae, Laevigatae, Tripetalae,\nPrismaticae, Ensatae, Ruthenicae, Hexagonae, and Chinensis, and I.\nsongarica. Within the core Limniris clade series Sibericae, Tripetalae,\nand Chinensis are polyphyletic while Laevigatae is paraphyletic. With\none exception, species within the core Limniris group are distributed in\neither Asia or North America, with a few Asian species extending into\nEurope and for the most widespread species, Iris pseudacorus (series\nLaevigatae), into northern Africa with naturalized populations in North\nAmerica. The one exception is I. setosa with a native range that\nincludes both eastern Asia and North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iris section Limniris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5330.phy"}]}
