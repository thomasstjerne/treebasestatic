Those specimens yielded a novel asexual morph of Jattaea\n(Calosphaeriaceae), Jattaea bruguierae, which is confirmed as a new\nspecies by morphological characters such as nature and measurements of\nconidia and conidiophores, as well as a multigene analyses based on\ncombined LSU, SSU, ITS and β-tubulin sequence data. Jattaea species are\nabundantly found from wood in terrestrial environments, while the\nasexual morphs are mostly reported from axenic cultures. Jattaea\nbruguierae is the first documentation of an asexual morph species from\nmarine- habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108606.phy"}]}
