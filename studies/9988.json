Mitochondrial sequence data\n(~500 bp) from individuals covering large parts of its (mainly insular)\ndistribution reveals deep cryptic variation and strong geographic\nstructure, with two well differentiated lineages. Molecular data also\nreveals that the wide Indian and Pacific insular distribution of Gehyra\nis very recent and, at least across the Indian Ocean islands, most\nprobably the result of human-aided dispersal, as no variation within\nthis lineage was found. Further research is needed to determine\ngeographic patterns of variation across Southeast Asia, the level of\ngenetic variation, and possible mechanisms of speciation. If recognized\nas distinct taxa, the binomen Gehyra insulensis should be resurrected,\nand applied to the Pacific lineage .","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gehyra mutilata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6629.phy"}]}
