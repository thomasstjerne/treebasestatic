While regional treatments\nof the genus have been conducted for Africa, South America and\nAustralia, there exists no study focusing on the Asian and Melanesian\nspecies. Previously, 24 species of Phyllopsora s. str. have been\nreported from major national studies and checklists representing 13\ncountries. We have studied herbarium material of 625 Phyllopsora\nspecimens from 18 countries using morphology, anatomy, secondary\nchemistry, and molecular data to investigate the diversity of\nPhyllopsora species in Asia and Melanesia. We report the occurrence of\n28 species of Phyllopsora including the following three species\ndescribed as new to science: P. sabahana from Malaysia, P. siamensis\nfrom Thailand and P. pseudocorallina from Asia and Africa. Eight species\nare reported as new to Asia. A key to the Asian and Melanesian species\nof Phyllopsora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"264","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllopsora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118288.phy"}]}
