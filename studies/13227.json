Of the 311 propagation materials and\nplants collected, 23% were infected by botryosphaeriaceous fungi. The\nhighest incidence was in failed grafted plants (33%), followed by Grade\n1 plants (28%), rootstock cuttings (19%), scion cuttings (17%) and Grade\n2 plants (7%). For grafted plants, most isolates (80%) were from near\nthe graft unions while infections on rootstocks and scion cuttings were\nmostly from the middle (39%) and basal parts (46%). Identification of\nisolates by morphological and molecular methods showed that seven\nspecies were present in nurseries, being Neofusicoccum luteum (57%), N.\nparvum (18%), N. australe (8%), Diplodia mutila (8%), Botryosphaeria\ndothidea (5%) and D. seriata (3%), with one novel isolate of N.\nmacroclavatum. These results show that Botryosphaeriaceae species were\npresent in propagation materials and in the grafted plants supplied by\nnurseries, indicating that some of the current vineyard infections may\nhave originated in the propagation nurseries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae species, NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_55930.phy"}]}
