The known species\ndiversity of the ornithuromorph clade has increased rapidly with the\naddition of new discoveries from the Early Cretaceous deposits of\nnortheastern China. Reported in this paper is the discovery of a new\nbird from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation, Liaoning Province,\nChina. The specimen represents a new species, Longicrusavis houi, but\nbears similarities to Hongshanornis longicresta from the same formation\nof Inner Mongolia. The two birds are comparable in size and share an\nunusual sigmoid mandible and elongate hindlimbs relative to their\nforelimbs. Together these taxa represent a clade (Hongshanornithidae,\nnew taxon) of specialized ‘shorebirds’ whose elongate hindlimbs indicate\necological adaptations different from those of other Jehol\nornithuromorphs. Phylogenetic relationships of Mesozoic birds are\ndiscussed based on the results of a comprehensive cladistic analysis.\nNew morphological information on Ornithuromorpha is provided through the\ndetailed description of the new taxon together with new information on\nHongshanornis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 9","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55834.phy"}]}
