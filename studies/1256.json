The current classification is largely based on\nmorphological characters and to a minor extent on physiology and host\nrange. In this study, a classification of the genus was constructed\nbased on DNA sequence data of three nuclear protein-coding genes (RPB2,\nG3PDH and HSP60) and compared with the traditional classification.\nSexual reproduction and the host range, important fitness traits, were\ntraced in the tree and used for the identification of major evolutionary\nevents during speciation. The phylogenetic analysis corroborated the\nclassical species delineation. In addition, the hybrid status of B.\nallii (B. byssoidea x B. aclada) was confirmed. Both individual gene\ntrees and combined trees show that the genus Botrytis can be divided\ninto two clades, radiating after the separation of Botrytis from other\nSclerotiniaceae genera. Clade I contains four species that all colonize\nexclusively eudicot hosts, whereas clade II contains 18 species which\nare pathogenic either on eudicot (5) or monocot (13) hosts. A comparison\nof Botrytis and angiosperm phylogenies shows that cospeciation of\npathogens and their hosts have not occurred during their respective\nevolution. Rather we propose that host shifts have occurred during\nBotrytis speciation, possibly by the acquisition of novel virulence\nfactors. Loss of sexual reproduction has occurred at least three times\nand is supposed to be a consequence of negative selection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_230.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP60 Bayes Majority rule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_297.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_471.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1974.phy"},{"tree_label":"G3PDH Bayes Maj Rule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1975.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 Bayes Maj Rule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1976.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1978.phy"},{"tree_label":"G3PDH hybrid MP Semistrict","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1979.phy"},{"tree_label":"G3PDH hybrid Bayes Maj Rule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1980.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP60 hybrid MP Semistrict","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1981.phy"},{"tree_label":"HSP60 hybrid Bayes Maj Rule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1982.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 hybrid MP Semistrict","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1983.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 hybrid Bayes Maj Rule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"the plant pathogenic genus Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1984.phy"}]}
