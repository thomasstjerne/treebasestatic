These species are found on dicots with\nApiaceae being one of the main host families. This study aims to clarify\nthe systematics and phylogeny of Entyloma on Eryngium (Apiaceae) with\nmolecular and morphological data. Eleven species from this group are\ndiscussed herein. Four of them are described as new taxa: E. carmeli sp.\nnov. on Eryngium falcatum, E. eryngii-cretici sp. nov. on Eryngium\ncreticum, E. eryngii-maritimi sp. nov. on Eryngium maritimum and E.\nho-chunkii sp. nov. on Eryngium yuccifolium. Analysis of the ITS region\nof rDNA is presented and supports the monophyly of Entyloma species on\nApiaceae and polyphyly of Entyloma on Eryngium. Within the Entyloma on\nApiaceae a cluster of species with anamorphs is presented, proving the\nidea that the anamorph is a taxonomically important character for\ndelimitation of species of Entyloma","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66318.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66319.phy"}]}
