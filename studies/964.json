These sequences include 1838 aligned positions\n(1013 parsimony informative for ingroup taxa) extending from the\nprotein-coding gene ND1 (subunit one of NADH dehydrogenase) through the\ngenes encoding tRNAIle, tRNAGln, tRNAMet, ND2 (NADH dehydrogenase\nsubunit two), tRNATrp, tRNAAla, tRNAAsn, tRNACys, tRNATyr, to the\nprotein-coding gene COI (subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase). These data,\nanalyzed in combination with 67 previously published morphological\ncharacters, provide statistical support for monophyly of iguanid\nsubfamilies Corytophaninae, Crotaphytinae, Hoplocercinae, Iguaninae,\nOplurinae, and Phrynosomatinae. Monophyly is neither supported nor\nstatistically rejected for iguanid subfamilies Polychrotinae and\nTropidurinae. Polychrotinae* and Tropidurinae* may be recognized as\nmetataxa, to denote the fact that evidence for their monophyly is\nequivocal, or replaced by recognizing as subfamilies constituent groups\nwhose monophyly has stronger empirical support. A phylogenetically\n(non-ranked) based, statistically robust taxonomy of iguanian lizards is\nproposed. The Old World lizard clade, Acrodonta, is comprised of\nChamaeleonidae and Agamidae* with the Agaminae, Amphibolurinae,\nDraconinae, Hydrosaurinae, Leiolepidinae, and Uromastycinae nested\nwithin Agamidae. The predominately New World clade, Iguanidae,\ncontains the groups Corytophaninae, Crotaphytinae, Hoplocercinae,\nIguaninae, Oplurinae, Phrynosomatinae, Polychrotinae, and\nTropidurinae* with Anolis, Leiosaurini (composed of the Leiosaurinae and\nEnyaliinae), and Polychrus as the subgroups of Polychrotinae* and\nLeiocephalini, Liolaemini, and Tropidurini as the subgroups of\nTropidurinae*.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_886.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iguanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_890.phy"}]}
