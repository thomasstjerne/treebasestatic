Despite the increasing\nnumber of studies using phylogenetic data to test DNC and evaluate\ncommunity assembly, it remains unknown whether phylogenetic\nrelationships alone can be used to predict invasion susceptibility\nacross communities differing environmentally and in disturbance history.\nIn this study, we evaluate whether phylogenetic structure of diverse\nnative communities predicts the occurrence of non-native species and\noffers insight into community assembly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"654","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesangiospermae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113123.phy"}]}
