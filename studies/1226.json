This is correct,\nbut the uncertainty may be extended to the sequences themselves. The\npresent study shows as long as vouchers are available neither problem is\nfatal, but if no voucher exists bad sequences and bad taxonomy may be\nforever linked. Previous phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequences have\nindicated that the small, south hemispheric, genus Oxychloë (Juncaceae)\nsurprisingly either is embedded within or sister group to the\nCyperaceae. This is not in accordance with traditional or current\nmorphological data. By studying five new accessions, representing four\nspecies of Oxychloë, and re-examining the two vouchers of the species,\nO. andina, previously used in phylogenies it has been possible to show\nthat these two sequences are erroneous. One being a chimeric sequence\nand the other most likely contaminated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Juncaceae-Cyperaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1884.phy"}]}
