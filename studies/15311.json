Cortinarius uraceomajalis is a vernal species\ncurrently only known from Hungary, Bulgaria and Italy, but likely is\ncommon throughout central and south-eastern Europe. Cortinarius\nuraceonemoralis is a widely distributed species in Europe. The new\ncombination Cortinarius nolaneiformis is based on Hydrocybe\nnolaneiformis Velen. And is a widespread species in Europe. Cortinarius\nuraceomajalis and C. nolaneiformis are preliminaryly placed in sect.\nColymbadini, characterised by having a positive (yellow) UV-reaction,\nwhile C. uraceonemoralis with a UV negative reaction is placed in sect.\nUracei. A neotype is selected for C. colymbadinus and C. uraceus to\nstabilize the nomenclature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Two new species of Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70316.phy"}]}
