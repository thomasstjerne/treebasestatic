We explored these relationships by combining two previously\npublished molecular datasets with new data to generate a complete matrix\n(7,104 bp) of evolutionarily disparate sequence elements from four genes\nfor 36 taxa. We analyzed each of the genes separately for base\ncomposition heterogeneity and heterozygosity. We analyzed the\nconcatenated matrix in a likeli‐ hood framework using seven different\npartitioning schemes. As the number of subsets in a given partitioning\nscheme increased, tree length and likelihood score also increased;\nhowever, the branching topology was little affected by increasingly\ncomplex partitioning schemes. Our best maximum likelihood tree has\nincreased bootstrap support at 13 of 30 ingroup nodes compared with\nprevious analyses, a result likely due to doubling the length of the\nsequence data. Coalescent‐based species tree inference produced a tree\ncongruent with all strongly supported nodes in the maxi‐ mum likelihood\ntree. This topology agrees with previous molecular studies in\nidentifying three small, early branching Old World genera (Eurostopodus,\nLyncornis, and Gactornis) and four more speciose terminal clades,\nrepresenting the New World nighthawks (genus Chordeiles) and three\nnightjar radiations centered in South America, Central America and the\nOld World, respectively. Increased node support across the tree\nreinforces a historical scenario with origins in the region surrounding\nthe Indian Ocean, followed by diversification in the New World and\nsubsequent recolonization and radiation in the Old World. Future work on\nthis group should incorporate additional members of the genera Lyncornis\nand Eurostopodus, to determine which is the basal lineage of\nCaprimulgidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"6 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97082.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDquartets","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97096.phy"},{"tree_label":"5 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97084.phy"},{"tree_label":"Soma PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97099.phy"},{"tree_label":"7 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97083","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Soma GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97098.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97097.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rag1 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97094","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97094.phy"},{"tree_label":"4 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97093","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97093.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cytb GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97092.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cmyc PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97091.phy"},{"tree_label":"1 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97090.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97089.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97088.phy"},{"tree_label":"6 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97087.phy"},{"tree_label":"5 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97086.phy"},{"tree_label":"7 PartFinder","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97085.phy"},{"tree_label":"4 GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nightjars","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97081.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cmyc GTRIG","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nightjars","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97095.phy"}]}
