This species is characterized by\nradially elongated pores, smooth and brown to dark brown pileus and\ncylindrical and slightly curved basidiospores. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on the ITS region revealed that P. longiporus forms a terminal,\nstrongly supported clade, closely related to P. ciliatus. A description\nand illustrations of the present species and a key to the species of\ngroup Polyporellus are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6099.phy"}]}
