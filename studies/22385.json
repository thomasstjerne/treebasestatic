Two new species in the M. elata clade, one\nfrom the Dominican Republic, initially distinguished by the informal\ndesignations Mel-18 and a second undesignated sister species from\nNorthern Arizona are now recognized. Mel-18 is described as a novel\nphylogenetically distinct species, M. hispaniolensis. Its previously\nundesignated sister species from Northern Arizona is described as M.\nkaibabensis. Two additional new species in the M. esculenta clade, one\nrecently discovered in Peru is described here as M. peruviana and\nanother from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Ecuador, previously\nknown taxon reported as Mes-14, is described as M. gracilis.\nAdditionally, M. vulgaris, (Mes-17), is reported from North America for\nthe first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella esculenta clade Mes-14","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113171.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella elata clade Mel-18","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113172.phy"}]}
