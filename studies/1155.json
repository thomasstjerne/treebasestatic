The wood decay genus Pleurotus may be atypical\nbecause more mating-types are found at the B locus than the A locus- the\nopposite pattern than observed for most other mushroom species. In this\nstudy we investigated the genetic structure of the A and B mating-type\nloci in Pleurotus by sequencing cosmids containing mating-type gene\nhomologues from the pantropical species P. djamor. The cosmids were\nisolated using a positional cloning method exploiting conserved gene\norder between the mating-type genes and more conserved genes having no\nfunction in mating (mitochondrial intermediate peptidase and CLA4). The\nsequences from the mating-type loci suggest that the types of genes\nresponsible for mating-type determination in P. djamor are the same as\nin the model mushroom species, namely homeodomain transcription factors\nand pheromone receptors. Three pheromone receptors were detected in a\nsingle isolate of P. djamor; it is possible there are more. However,\nonly one pair of homeodomain genes was found in the A mating-type\nregion. Although additional, undetected homeodomain genes may occur in\nthe P. djamor genome, it is hypothesized that the A mating-type locus of\nP. djamor is comprised of only one homeodomain pair, in part explaining\nthe lower number of A mating-types relative to the two or more pairs\nfound in the model species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"basidiomycete pheromone receptors","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_222.phy"}]}
