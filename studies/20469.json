Species in\nthis genus are prolific producers of rhizomorphs, or vegetative\nstructures, which, when found, are often associated with infection.\nBecause of their importance as plant pathogens, understanding the\nevolutionary origins of this genus and how it gained a worldwide\ndistribution is of interest. Interestingly, the first gasteroid fungus\nwith close affinities to ArmillariaGuyanagaster necrorhizuswas described\nfrom the Neotropical rainforests of Guyana. In this study, we conducted\nphylogenetic analyses to fully resolve the relationship of G.\nnecrorhizus with Armillaria. Data sets containing Guyanagaster from two\ncollecting localities, along with a global sampling of 21 Armillaria\nspeciesincluding newly collected specimens from Guyana and Africaat six\nloci (28S, EF1α, RPB2, TUB, actin-1 and gpd) were used. Three loci28S,\nEF1α and RPB2were analyzed in a partitioned nucleotide data set to infer\ndivergence dates and ancestral range estimations for well-supported,\nmonophyletic lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria and Guyanagaster\nLSU_GPD_RPB2_EF1a_Tub_actin1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101642.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria and Guyanagaster\nLSU_GPD_RPB2_EF1a_Tub_actin1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101656.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1atree","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101645","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101645.phy"},{"tree_label":"3gpdtree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101644","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101644.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSUtrees","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101646","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101646.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria and Guyanagaster\nLSU_GPD_RPB2_EF1a_Tub_actin1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101643.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101648.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tubtree","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101649","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101649.phy"}]}
