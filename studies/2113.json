This comprehensive analysis of the impact of gap\ncharacter incorporation spanned four different indel coding schemes,\ngaps coded as missing characters, simple binary characters, multi-state\ncharacters, and as a 5th state, across two optimality criteria: maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian Inference. Two nuclear (ITS and Waxy) and six\nchloroplast (trnS/G, trnL/F, trnK, matK, trnD/T, and rpoB-trnC) DNA\nregions were sequenced from 43 species of North American Psoraleeae as\nthe foundation of the study. Our results suggest that gaps can provide a\nsubstantial percentage of informative characters and can increase\nphylogenetic resolution and nodal branch support. Phylogenetic signal\nwithin indels was higher in chloroplast regions relative to nuclear\nregions, demonstrating their inclusion as especially important in\nchloroplast-based phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic analysis of generic\nrelationships within Psoraleeae is largely congruent with that proposed\nby Grimes (1990) with a few exceptions. New World species are supported\nas a monophyletic group. Our analyses suggest that Otholobium may need\nto be split into two genera and that Psoralidium is polyphyletic and\nwill require movement of Psoralidium tenuiflorum to Pediomelum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"99te DNA 1p0g MB con","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3081.phy"},{"tree_label":"99te DNA mp1g MB con","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3082.phy"},{"tree_label":"99te DNA 1p1g MB con","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3083.phy"},{"tree_label":"99te DNA mp0g MB con","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3084.phy"},{"tree_label":"54t DNA mp1g MB con","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3085.phy"},{"tree_label":"54t DNA mp0g MB con","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3086.phy"},{"tree_label":"54t DNA 1p0g MB con","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3087.phy"},{"tree_label":"54t DNA 1p1g MB con","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Psoraleeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3088.phy"}]}
