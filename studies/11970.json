To date, three\ninnate immune signaling pathways  the nuclear factor\n(NF)-kappaB-dependent Toll and immune deficient (IMD) pathways and the\nJanus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription\n(Jak-STAT) pathway  have been extensively characterized in An. gambiae.\nHowever, in addition to NF-kappaB-dependent signaling, three\nmitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways regulated by JNK, ERK\nand p38 MAPK are critical mediators of innate immunity in other\ninvertebrates and in mammals. Our understanding of the roles of the MAPK\nsignaling cascades in anopheline innate immunity is limited, so\nidentification of the encoded complement of these proteins, their\nupstream activators, and phosphorylation profiles in response to\nrelevant immune signals was warranted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree of MAPK catalytic domain\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48963.phy"}]}
