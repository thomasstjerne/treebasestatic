Their previous\ndescription as P. megasperma and P. drechsleri was re-examined in the\nlight of RFLPs and sequence comparisons of internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) regions of rDNA. Both taxa were more closely related to a clade\ncomprising P. sojae, P. cajani, P. vignae, P. melonis and P. sinensis\nthan to the unrelated P. megasperma s. str. or P. drechsleri. The P.\nmegasperma-like isolates from pistachio differed from all the above taxa\nin morphology, ITS sequence and AFLP patterns, and are described as a\nnew species, P. pistaciae. The P. drechsleri-like isolates from\npistachio had identical ITS sequences to those of P. melonis, P.\nsinensis and P. drechsleri-like isolates from cucurbits in Iran and the\nAFLP profiles of P. melonis, P. sinensis and the P. drechsleri-like\nisolates from pistachio were virtually identical. This and other\npublished isozyme and mtDNA evidence suggests these taxa should be\nconsidered conspecific and all subsumed within P. melonis with a revised\nhost range and geographical distribution. The relationships of P.\nmelonis and P. pistaciae with other members belonging to the same ITS\nclade are considered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pistaciae and sister taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3896.phy"}]}
