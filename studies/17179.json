These siphonous\nmacroalgae are composed of a single giant tubular cell containing\nmillions of nuclei and chloroplasts, and harbor diverse bacterial\ncommunities. Little is known about the diversity of chloroplast genomes\n(cpDNAs) in this group, and about the possible consequences of\nintracellular bacteria on genome composition of the host. We present the\ncomplete cpDNAs of Bryopsis plumosa and Tydemania expeditiones, as well\nas a re-annotated cpDNA of B. hypnoides, which was shown to contain a\nhigher number of genes than originally published. Chloroplast genomic\ndata were also used to evaluate phylogenetic hypotheses in the\nChlorophyta, such as monophyly of the Ulvophyceae (the class in which\nthe order Bryopsidales is currently classified).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85894.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85895.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85896.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85897.phy"}]}
