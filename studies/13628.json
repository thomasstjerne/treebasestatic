Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony, Bayesian, maximum\nlikelihood) showed the divergence of four forms that correlated with\nhost specificity and geographic locations: P. triticina from common\nhexaploid wheat that is found worldwide; P. triticina from cultivated\ntetraploid durum wheat is found wordwide; P. triticina from tetraploid\ndurum wheat from Ethiopia and P. triticina from diploid Aegilops\nspeltoides that has been found only in Israel. Phylogenetic analyses and\ncoalescence based genealogy samplers both indicated that P. triticina on\ndiploid A. speltoides , the probable B genome donor of hexaloid wheat,\ndiverged initially, followed by the Ethiopian durum wheat form and then\nby the common wheat form. P. triticina on worldwide cultivated durum\nwheat was the most recently coalesced form, which formed a clade nested\nwithin the common wheat form. By a relative time scale, the divergence\nof P. triticinia forms as delimited by host specificity appears very\nrecent. Significant reciprocal gene flow between the common wheat form\nand the durum wheat form , and from the common wheat form to Ethiopian\ndurum form was detected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58525.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58518.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58512.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58519.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58524.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58515.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58529","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58529.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58536.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58516.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58517.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58514.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58509.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58513.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58534","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58534.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58537.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58511.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58510.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58520.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58521.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58522.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58523.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58526.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58527.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58528","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58528.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58530","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58530.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58531","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58531.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58532","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58532.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58533.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58535","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58535.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 30","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58538.phy"}]}
