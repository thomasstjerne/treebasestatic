A new species, Cladosporium hebeiense\nwas isolated belonging to the genus Cladosporium from leaf spots of\nVitis vinifera in China. Morphologically distinct C. hebeiense consists\nof erect, flexuous, distinctly geniculate, subcylindrical conidiophores;\npale green-brown, smooth, thick-walled conidia with protuberant and\ndarkened conidial hila; and aseptate, obovoidal to short ellipsoidal,\nsmall terminal conidia. A multigene phylogenetic analysis based on the\ninternal transcribed spacer region, partial translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha gene and the actin gene shown C. hebeiense as a new\nspecies, different from C. ramotenellum. This study provides\nmorphological and molecular biological studies of the new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium hebeiense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110605.phy"}]}
