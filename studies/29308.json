Macromorphologically, fruiting\nbodies were annual to perennial, woody, sessile, dimidiate to ungulate,\nup to 23 cm in diameter and 20 cm in thickness. Hymenium part is whitish\nwith 4-5 pores per mm. Micromorphological characters revealed ovoid to\nellipsoid, truncated, double-walled, brown and spinulose basidiospores\nwhich up to (8.65-11.28) x (4.93-7.17). Hyphal system is trimetic with\nhyaline and clamped generative hyphae. Binding hyphae are profusely\nbranched, thinner and lighter than the skeletal hyphae which are thick\nand golden brown. Morphological characteristics showed high similarity\nto Ganoderma adspersum. In addition, the comparison of the sequences of\nGanoderma species revealed 100% homology with the ITS sequences of G.\nadsperesum and closure to those originated from Italy. According to this\nknowledge, this study is the first report of Ganoderma adspersum in\nNorthern African forest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135242","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135242.phy"}]}
