These features include a\nfrontoparietal dome, an enlarged nuchal ridge that obscures the\noccipital region, a circular orbit, ventral curvature in the\nposterolaterally directed paroccipital processes, a posteroventrally\ndirected foramen magnum, and a number of features on the braincase. The\nphylogenetic analysis positions Tatankacephalus with Ankylosauridae\nbased on its sharing of several characters with other members of this\nclade, including an enlarged nuchal segment that obscures the occiput in\ndorsal view, a ventrally curving lateral profile of the cranium anterior\nto the orbit, pyramidal postorbital boss, laterally projecting pyramidal\nquad- ratojugal boss, the presence of a postocular shelf, the presence\nof paranasal sinuses, and the lack of a cingulum on a max- illary (or\ndentary) tooth. It is considered a basal member of Ankylosauridae\nbecause it retains premaxillary teeth and a visible lateral temporal\nfenestra, in contrast to the absence of premaxillary teeth and an\nobscured lateral temporal fenestra in younger members of this\nclade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 18","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ankylosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55984.phy"}]}
