Important points of uncertainty or contention include, apart\nfrom ranking problems, monophyly of Papilionoidea plus Hesperioidea,\ntheir relationship with other Lepidoptera in general and the Hedyloidea\nin particular, the question of the sister group of the Pieridae (either\nPapilionidae, or Lycaenidae + Nymphalidae), and the division of families\ninto subfamilies. Traditional groupings are discussed and compared with\nthe results of a cladistic analysis using 103 characters and 74 species\n(59 butterflies and 15 moths). The cladistic analysis supports a number\nof currently held views about butterfly classification, such as\nmonophyly of five major family groupings (Hesperiidae, Papilionidae,\nPieridae, Lycaenidae and Nymphalidae) and suggests sister group\nrelationships between Papilionoidea and Hesperioidea, and Pieridae and\n(Lycaenidae + Nymphalidae). Most traditional subfamilies, however, are\nnot supported on the basis of the data set used but the Riodininae,\nwhich always appeared as a monophyletic, subordinate group within the\nLycaenidae, are a notable exception. Further, the analysis suggests\nthat, contrary to traditional ideas, the Parnassiinae, not Baroniinae,\nare sister to the remainder of the Papilionidae, Pseudopontiinae are\ninternal to (Pierinae + Coliadinae), Dismorphiinae are sister to all\nother Pieridae, and that Liptena, Poritia and Miletus represent the\nclosest relatives of the Riodininae. The data set is not well suited for\nan assessment of the position of the butterflies amongst other\nLepidoptera. Nevertheless, of the moths used, Macrosoma (Hedylidae,\nHedyloidea) and Urania (Uraniidae, Geometroidea) appear to be the\nclosest relatives of the butterflies. With regard to the higher\nclassification of the butterflies many problems thus remain, and several\nways to tackle these are discussed. The need for some form of\ninternational co-operation between fieldworkers, comparative\nmorphologists and molecular systematists is stressed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1154.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1143.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1141.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1142.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1138.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1139.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1140.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1146.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1147.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1148.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1149.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1150.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1151.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7b","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1152.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1153.phy"}]}
