Eukaryotic communities\nfrom deep horizons of boreal peatlands potentially contain large\ndiversity of fungal species that are poorly accessible to\nnon-sequence-based detection methods. In this work, we describe\nHolomycota communities associated with organic matter and pore water in\noxygen-depleted horizons of a boreal peatland in the Moscow region using\nhigh-throughput sequencing of highly variable domains of the 18S rRNA\ngene. We find high abundance and diversity of zoosporic fungi and taxa\nwith a yeast-like growth, indicating the similarity of deep peat\ncommunities with aquatic ones. Many Eumycota taxa in the peatland are\nfound to be represented by extremotolerant fungi, including dwellers of\nextreme habitats  Neocallimastigomycota and Wallemiomycetes. Remarkably,\nsequences belonging to the early-diverging Holomycota phylum\nRozellomycota (Cryptomycota) appear to dominate peat and water\ncommunities, accounting for 2580% of the Holomycota sequences. With only\na few exceptions, the deep peat was found to contain representatives\nfrom all major clades of the Rozellomycota phylum. Our results expand\nthe diversity of fungal lineages and show that deep oxygen-depleted\nhorizons of boreal peatland serve as repositories of early-diverging\nHolomycota species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S7a","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5b","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytridiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Zoopagomycota,\nMucoromycota, Blastocladiomycota, and Aphelida v3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114066.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5a","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cristidiscoidea and other Holomycota OTUs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114064.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microsporidia and Rozellida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114063.phy"}]}
