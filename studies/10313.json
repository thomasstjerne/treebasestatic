A new undescribed belowground vegetative structure of\nMorchella tomentosa in a burned boreal forest was investigated north of\nFairbanks, Alaska. The name “radiscisclerotium” is proposed to define\nthis peculiar and elaborate belowground vegetative structure of M.\ntomentosa. Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses based on ITS rRNA\nregions and nLSU gene strongly supported a new clade composed of M.\ntomentosa within the genus Morchella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6752.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6724.phy"}]}
