In this\nstudy, taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on species of Amauroderma s.\nlat. were carried out by morphological examination together with\nultrastructural observations, and molecular phylogenetic analyses of\nmultiple loci including the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS),\nthe large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and the second subunit of RNA\npolymerase II (RPB2), the translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF)\nand the β-tubulin gene (TUB). The results demonstrated that species of\nGanodermataceae formed ten clades. Species previously addressed in\nAmauroderma s. lat. were divided into four clades: Amauroderma s. str.,\nForaminispora, Furtadoa and a new genus Sanguinoderma. The\nclassification of Amauroderma s. lat. is revised, six new species are\ndescribed and illustrated, and eight new combinations are proposed. The\nkeys to species of Amauroderma s. str., Foraminispora, Furtadoa, and\nSanguinoderma are provided respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amauroderma 173x3368","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116909.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amauroderma 173x4824","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116910.phy"}]}
