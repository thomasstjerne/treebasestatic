Diaporthe species have\nbeen associated with twig canker, shoot blight, dieback, wood decay and\nfruit rot on members of the Rosaceae. In this study a collection of\nisolates from several Rosaceae hosts were characterised by multi-locus\nsequence analyses using the internal transcribed spacer, translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha, beta-tubulin, histone H3 and calmodulin loci.\nThe phylogenetic analyses of the combined five loci revealed that the\nisolates studied were distributed among four clades, of which two\ncorrespond to D. foeniculina and D. eres. The other two clades, closely\nrelated to D. passiflorae and D. leucospermi represent two new species,\nD. pyracanthae sp. nov. and D. malorum sp. nov., respectively. Further,\npathogenicity assays have shown that of the four species tested, D.\nmalorum was the most aggressive species on apple fruit and D. eres was\nthe most aggressive species on detached pear twigs. A revision of all\nDiaporthe (and Phomopsis) names that have been associated with Rosaceae\nhosts as well as their current status as pathogens of members of this\nfamily is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Rosaceae ITS TEF1 TUB HIS CAL MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101053.phy"}]}
