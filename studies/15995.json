Fifty one LAB strains\nwere isolated and four strains were identified as Lactobacillus (GI6,\nGI9, GI11 and GI15), three strains were identified as Weissella (FKI13,\nFKI21 and FKI29) and screened for their probiotic potential. The in\nvitro tests including survival in simulated acidic (pH 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0)\nand bile conditions (0.30% and 0.50% w/v), antimicrobial activity\n(against three gram negative, two gram positive bacteria and one yeast),\nresistance to eleven antibiotics and cholesterol reducing property were\nanalyzed. All the Lactobacillus and Weissella strains were able to\nsurvive in low pH and bile salt conditions at pH 3.0 and 0.30% bile salt\nfor 3 h while GI9 and FKI21 were able to resist pH 2.0 and 0.50% bile\nsalt for 3h without losing their viability. All LAB strains exhibited\ninhibitory activity against tested pathogens and FKI21 showed highest\ndiameter mean (9.04±0.55) against gram negative bacteria. The majority\nof the tested strains were resistant to gentamycin, cefuroxime,\nofloxacin and erythromycin, while sensitive to novobiocin and kanamycin.\nAll strains were able to deconjugate bile salts, where higher\ndeconjugation was observed in the presence of sodium glycocholate\n(P<0.05). The strain FKI21 showed maximum autoaggregation (79%) and\ncoaggregation with E. coli MTCC 1089 (68%). The exopolysaccharide\nproduction was ranged from 68.39 to 127.12 mg/L (P<0.05). Moreover,\nmaximum cholesterol reduction was observed in GI9 (58.08 µg/ml) and\nFKI21 (56.25 µg/ml) with bile salts. Due to their probiotic potential,\nthe strains GI9 and FKI21 were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and\nconfirmed as Lactobacillus crispatus GI9 and Weissella koreensis FKI21\nand regarded as a novel probiotic. This is the first study reporting the\nisolation of Weissella koreensis FKI21 from fermented koozh and\ndemonstrates their cholesterol reducing potential.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree # 8 simulated by Coalescence Contained within\nCurrent Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75675","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree #
