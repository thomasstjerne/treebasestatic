Xenosporium formosaforme and X. parvulum are described\nand illustrated as new species. Xenosporium africanum is described in\nthis paper as a new record for Taiwan. The phylogenetic relationship of\nXenosporium species and related taxa were sought by comparing the\nsequences of their nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S- ITS2 (ITS barcode). Phylogenetic\nanalysis of these Xenosporium species supports their placement in the\nTubeufiaceae. A synopsis of Xenosporium species producing ellipsoidal or\novoid conidia is given. The criteria used to differentiate species are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree ord","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110454.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree tub","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110455.phy"}]}
