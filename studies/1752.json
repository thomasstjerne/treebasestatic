In addition,\nResinicium bicolor and R. friabile are redescribed and illustrated.\nSequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region support the\nrecognition of the new taxa. Furthermore, nuclear small subunit\nribosomal RNA sequence data support the recognition of two groups of\nResinicium species: the Resinicium sensu stricto group, including R.\nbicolor, and the Resinicium sensu lato group that includes R.\nfurfuraceum. The genus Resinicium is redefined and a key to the\nResinicium sensu stricto species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S MB","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4774.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S ML","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4775.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MB","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resinicium sensu stricto","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4770.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resinicium sensu stricto","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4771.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resinicium sensu stricto","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1B","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4773.phy"}]}
