Steccherinum rubigimaculatum is\ndistinguished by odontioid hymenial surface dotted with rust tints and\nlonger aculei (up to 0.5 mm), a dimitic hyphal system with\nsimple-septata generative hyphae, strongly encrusted cystidia and\nellipsoid, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores (3.55 × 2.53.5\nµm). Sequences of ITS and LSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples\nwere generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods. The\nphylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of ITS+nLSU sequences\nshowed that the two new species belonged to the Steccherinaceae and\nnested into the residual polyporoid clade. The result demonstrated that\nSteccherinum puerense singly formed a well-supported monophyletic\nlineage distinct from other Steccherinum species and S. rubigimaculatum\nsistered to S. bourdotii with a strong support.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129222","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129222.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129224.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129226.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129223.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129225.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129227.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129228.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129230.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129231","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129231.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 11","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129232","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129232.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 12","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129233","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129233.phy"}]}
