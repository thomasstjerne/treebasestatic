Phytophthora grouped with Pythium,\nPeronospora, and Halophytophthora, distant from genera in the\nSaprolegniales. Albugo was intermediate between these two groups. Unlike\nPythium, Phytophthora was essentially monophyletic, all but three\nspecies forming a cluster of eight clades. Two clades contained only\nspecies with non-papillate sporangia. The other six clades included\neither papillate and semi-papillate, or semi-papillate and non-papillate\ntypes, transcending traditional morphological groupings, which are\nevidently not natural assemblages. Peronospora was related to P.\nmegakarya and P. palmivora and appears to be derived from a Phytophthora\nthat has both lost the ability to produce zoospores and become an\nobligate biotroph. Three other Phytophthoras located some distance from\nthe main Phytophthora-Peronospora cluster and probably represent one or\nmore additional genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of some oomycota genera (5.8S and\nITS2 data only)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of most taxa in the genus\nPhytophthora (ITS1, 5.8S & ITS2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3688.phy"}]}
