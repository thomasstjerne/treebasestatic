Although\nfossils have been recognized as being of potential importance in\nresolving the issue2,3, a lack of consensus over their systematics4,5\nhas obscured their contribution. Here, I show that a group of previously\nproblematic Cambrian arthropods from the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang\nfaunas form a clade close to crown-group euarthropods, the group\ncontaining myriapods, chelicerates, insects and crustaceans6. They are\ncharacterized by modified or even absent endopods, and two pre-oral\nappendages. Comparison with reconstructions of the crown-group\neuarthropod ground plan6 and recent investigations into onychophorans7,8\ndemonstrates that these two appendages are the first antenna (of extant\ncrustaceans) and a more anterior appendage associated with an ocular\nsegment. The latter appendage has been reduced in all crown-group\neuarthropods. Its most likely relic is as a component of the labrum9.\nThese fossils thus tie together results from disparate living groups\n(onychophorans and euarthropods).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"upper stem-group euarthropods","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4036.phy"}]}
