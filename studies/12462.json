As morphological difference\nbetween the two groups are not yet marked distinctly, we suppose that\nthe process of speciation has not yet been finished and propose a new\nvariety, E. japonica var. crispulae, for the latter group based on the\ndifference in host range and the distinct genetic segregation. Q. robur\n(pedunculate oak) is a new host of E. japonica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52239","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52239.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52238.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52241","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52241.phy"}]}
