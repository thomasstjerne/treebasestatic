MIF proteins\nalso play a role in innate immunity of invertebrate organisms or serve\nas virulence factors in parasitic organisms, raising the question of\ntheir evolutionary history and of a putative differential evolution of\nstructure/function relationships. We performed a broad survey of MIF\npresence or absence and evolutionary relationships across 803 species of\nplants, fungi, protists, and animals, and explored a potential relation\nwith the taxonomic status, the ecology, and the lifestyle of individual\nspecies. We show that MIF evolutionary history is complex, involving\nancestral duplications, multiple gene losses and recent clade-specific\nre-duplications. Of note, plants and plant parasites (other than fungi)\nharbour a median number of three MIFs, while heterotrophic and animal\nparasite species harbour a lower and variable MIF number. Intriguingly,\nMIFs seem to be essential and highly conserved with many sites under\npurifying selection in some kingdoms (e.g. plants), while in other\nkingdoms they appear more dispensable (e.g. in fungi) or present in\nseveral diverged variants (e.g. insects, nematodes), suggesting\npotential neofunctionalizations within the protein superfamily.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"224","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114051","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114051.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"224","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114098.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114045.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114047","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114047.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114048","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114048.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114044.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114046","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114046.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114052","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114052.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"718","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114097.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"718","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114096.phy"}]}
