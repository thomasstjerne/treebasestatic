WRKY genes contain one or two highly\nconserved DNA binding domains interrupted by an intron. We used partial\nsequences of five independent WRKY loci to assess their potential for\nphylogeny reconstruction. Loci were originally isolated from Theobroma\ncacao by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers; loci-specific\nprimers were subsequently designed. We tested those loci across the\nsister genera Herrania and Theobroma, with Guazuma ulmifolia as the\noutgroup. Overall, the combined WRKY matrices performed as well or\nbetter than other genes in resolving the intrageneric phylogeny of\nHerrania and Theobroma as measured by bootstrap values. The ease of\nisolating numerous, independent WRKY loci from diverse plant species,\nwith a single pair of degenerate primers designed to the highly\nconserved WRKY domain, renders them extremely useful tools for\ngenerating multiple, single- or low-copy nuclear loci for molecular\nphylogenetic studies at lower taxonomic levels.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theobroma and Herrania 2 WRKY loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_574.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theobroma and Herrania 5 WRKY loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_673.phy"}]}
