In this\nstudy, Colletotrichum strains associated with avocado anthracnose\ncollected in different states from Brazil were evaluated through\nphylogenetic analysis, morphological characterization and pathogenicity\nassays. Moreover, the events during pathogen infection of avocados were\nexamined by scanning electron microscope. To access genetic diversity of\n54 Colletotrichum strains was performed partial sequence analysis of the\ngene gapdh. A subset of 14 strains was selected based on the generated\ngroupings and the geographical origin for performing multilocus\nphylogeny analysis (gapdh, act, tub2 and ApMat). Two species previously\ndescribed were identified: C. siamense belonging to the C.\ngloeosporioides species complex and Colletotrichum karstii belonging to\nthe C. boninensespecies complex. All Colletotrichum strains evaluated\ncaused typical symptoms of anthracnose in avocado fruits. The most\nvirulent strain showed germination of the its conidia occurred between 6\nand 12 hai. Penetration through wounds occurred 48 hai, tissue\ncolonization occurred between 144 and 240 hai, and sporulation at 240\nhai via the production of acervulus, conidiophores and conidia. The\nfindings shed light on the aetiology of avocado anthracnose in Brazil\nand provide a better understanding of infection process of this\npathogen, which may assist in the development of disease management\nstrategies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum APMAT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128404.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128405.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum GAPDH CBSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128403.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128402.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GAPDH ACT TUB APMAT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128407.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum GAPDH CGSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128406.phy"}]}
