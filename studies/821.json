We used DNA sequence data of\n9,006 aligned base pairs from five genes (chloroplast atpB, matK, rbcL,\nand 18S and 26S nrDNA) to elucidate relationships among major lineages\nof Saxifragales (angiosperms, eudicots). These relationships were poorly\nsupported in previous studies, apparently because the lineages\noriginated in rapid succession. Using an array of methods that\nexplicitly incorporate assumptions about evolutionary process (weighted\nmaximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, LogDet/paralinear transformed\ndistances), we show that the initial diversification of Saxifragales was\nindeed rapid. We suggest that the poor resolution of our best\nphylogenetic estimate is not due to violations of assumptions or to\ncombining data partitions having conflicting histories or processes. We\nshow that estimated branch lengths during the initial diversification\nare exceedingly short, and we estimate that acquiring sufficient\nsequence data to resolve these relationships would require an\nextraordinary effort (=10^7 bp), assuming a linear increase in branch\nsupport with branch length. However, our simulation of much larger data\nsets containing a distribution of phylogenetic signal similar to that of\nthe five sampled gene sequences suggests a limit to achievable branch\nsupport. Using statistical tests of differences in the likelihoods of\ntopologies, we evaluated whether the initial radiation of Saxifragales\ninvolved the simultaneous origin of major lineages. Our results are\nconsistent with predictions that resolving branching order of rapid,\nancient radiations requires sampling characters that evolved rapidly at\nthe time of the radiation but have since experienced a slower\nevolutionary rate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP-cpDNA-pruned","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1209.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML-nrDNA-pruned","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1210.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP-nrDNA-pruned","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1211.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP-nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1207.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML-cpDNA-pruned","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1208.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP-cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1206.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP-5 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1212.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML-5 genes-pruned","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1213.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML-5 genes-constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1214.phy"}]}
