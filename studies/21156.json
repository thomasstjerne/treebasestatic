The grape and peony\nisolates share sequence homology in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosate\ndehydrogenase (G3PDH), heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), DNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase subunit II (RPB2), and necrosis and ethylene-inducing\nproteins 1 and 2 (NEP1 and NEP2) genes that place them in a distinct\ngroup closely related to B. aclada, a globally distributed pathogen of\nonion. Genetic results were corroborated with morphological and\npathogenicity trials that included two isolates of B. cinerea and two\nisolates B. paeoniae from peony in Alaska, and one isolate of B. aclada.\nWe observed differences in colony and conidium conidia morphology and\nability to cause lesions on different host tissues that suggest that the\ngrape and peony isolates represent a distinct species. Most notably, the\ngrape and peony isolates did not colonize onion bulbs, whereas B. aclada\nreadily produced lesions and prolific sporulation on onion tissue. This\nnew species Botrytis euroamericana is described herein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105256.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105260.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105258.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105259.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105257.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105261.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis euroamericana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105262.phy"}]}
