The most abundant taxon amongst these is\nthe ornithuromorph Gansus yumenensis, but enantiornithines have also\nbeen identified in the sample. Here we describe two incomplete,\nsemi-articulated appendicular skeletons, the first consisting of a\npartial left pelvic girdle and complete pelvic limb, and the second\ncomprised of a nearly complete right pelvic limb. Both specimens bear\ncharacteristics diagnostic of Enantiornithes, and are referred to a new\ntaxon, Qiliania graffini gen. et sp. nov. The exceptional,\nthree-dimensional preservation of these specimens (compared to the\ncrushed, nearly two-dimensional condition of most other Early Cretaceous\navian fossils) reveals new information regarding enantiornithine\nanatomy, evolution, and diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55330.phy"}]}
