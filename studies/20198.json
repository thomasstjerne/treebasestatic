DNA- based studies have determined four\ngenera within the family. In this study, we introduce a new species of\nNeooccultibambusa with evidence from morphology and analyses of combined\nLSU, SSU and RPB2 sequence data. The novel taxon is characterized by\nimmersed to semi-immersed ascomata in fissures of bark, central\nperiphysate ostioles, a two- layered peridium, filiform, septate,\ncellular pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical to subcylindrical asci,\nguttulate, hyaline to brown ascospores and in producing asexual morph\nchlamydospores in culture. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that the\nspecies belongs to Neooccultibambusa and forms a separate clade in the\ngenus. Neooccultibambusa jonesii can be readily distinguished from the\ngeneric type, N. chiangraiensis by its2-septate, mature dark brown\nascospores lacking a mucilaginous sheath.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neooccultibambusa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101839.phy"}]}
