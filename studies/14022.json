While phenotypic differentiation in characters, such\nas size or shape among insular organisms, has been well studied, insular\ndifferentiation in quantitative reproductive traits involved in chemical\ncommunication has received very little attention to date. Here, we\ninvestigated the impact of insularity on two syntopic bumblebee species\npairs: one including species that are phylogenetically related (Bombus\nterrestris and B. lucorum), and the other including species that\ninteract ecologically (B. terrestris and its specific nest inquiline B.\nvestalis). For each bumblebee species, we characterized the patterns of\nvariation and differentiation of insular (Corsican) vs. mainland\n(European) populations (i) with four genes (nuclear and mitochondrial,\n3781bp) and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions\n(MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees, by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results provide evidence\nfor genetic differentiation in Corsican bumblebees and show that,\ncontrary to theoretical expectations, island populations of bumblebees\nexhibit levels of genetic variation similar to the mainland populations.\nLikewise, our comparative chemical analyses of MMS indicate that\nCorsican populations of bumblebees are significantly differentiated from\nthe mainland yet they hold comparative levels of within-population MMS\nvariability compared to the mainland. Therefore, insularity has led\nCorsican populations to diverge both genetically and chemically from\ntheir mainland relatives, presumably through genetic drift, but without\na decrease of genetic diversity in island populations. We hypothesize\nthat MMS divergence in Corsican bumblebees was driven by a persistent\nlack of gene flow with mainland populations and reinforced by the\npreference of Corsican females for sympatric (Corsican) MMS. The\nimpoverished Corsican bumblebee fauna has not led to relaxation of\nstabilizing selection on MMS but to consistent differentiation chemical\nreproductive traits on the island.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62101","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62101.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62104","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62104.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62096.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62107.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62110.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1+","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62097.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62098.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62113.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1+","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62102","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62102.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62106.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62099.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62105","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62105.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62108","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62108.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4+","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62109","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62109.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62111","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62111.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62112.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1+","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62100.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mainland vs. Corsican populations of Bumblebees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62103.phy"}]}
