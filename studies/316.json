Nineteen Wagner trees were constructed using different\ncombinations of character subsets and outgroups. Although 12 trees were\nconstructed using the largest character cliques uncovered by character\ncompatibility analysis, these were highly unresolved. Four additional\ntrees were constructed using phenetic methods. Trees resulting from the\nvarious procedures were compared using several optimality criteria.\nWagner trees based on all 42 characters or on the subset of 27\nreproductive characters were most successful according to these\ncriteria. Branch-swapping trials, based upon common features found in\nthe Wagner and other trees produced another 10 trees that were as\nsuccessful as the Wagner trees. The number of about equally successful\ntrees is partly a function of homoplasy. Two-thirds of the character\nstate changes on the trees are homoplasious. The primitive breeding\nsystem of the Pontederiaceae is not clearly resolved, but heterostyly is\nprobably a synapomorphy of only one lineage of the family. A vicariance\nexplanation of the biogeography of the family, based on a Gondwanan\ndistribution, seems less parsimonious than an origin in South America,\nfollowed by several eastward dispersals. While Monochoria and Pontederia\nare apparently monophyletic under different analyses, Eichhornia and\nHeteranthera, as presently circumscribed, are probably\nparaphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pontederiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_679.phy"}]}
