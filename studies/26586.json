Phylogenetic analyses using\nITS+tef1-Î±+tub2+rpb2 revealed that the Lasiodiplodia isolates in this\nstudy were classified into eight clades including L. theobromae, L.\nbrasiliensis, L. thailandica, L. pseudotheobromae, Lasiodiplodia spp..\nNine species of Lasiodiplodia were recognized based on phylogenetic\nrelationship, morphorogial characteristics and each optimum growth\ntemperature, and 4 of them were newly recorded in Japanese mycoflora.\nFurthermore, new species L. hearbacea, L. latiosporus, L. parvisporus,\nand L. ryukyuensis are proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_5337","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia its tef1 tub2 rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124635.phy"}]}
