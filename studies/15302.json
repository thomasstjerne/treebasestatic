N. illicii\nmorphologically differs from Neofabraea alba, Neofabraea krawtzewii,\nNeofabraea malicorticis and Neofabraea perennans with its smaller\nascospore size, and from Neofabraea eucalypti by its 1-septate\nascospore. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions using maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian methods indicates that N. illicii is\ndistinct.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70295","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70295.phy"}]}
