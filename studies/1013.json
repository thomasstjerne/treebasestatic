To\nprovide new data for use in deep-level metazoan phylogenetic studies,\nprimers were developed to amplify a 1.3-kilobase region of the alpha\nsubunit of the nuclear-encoded sodium-potassium ATPase gene from\nnineteen bilaterians representing several phyla. Maximum parsimony,\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of these sequences (combined\nwith ATPase sequences for twenty-three taxa downloaded from Genbank)\nyield largely congruent trees that corroborate recent findings based on\nanalyses of other data sets (e.g., the 18S ribosomal RNA gene). The\nATPase-based trees support monophyly for several clades (including\nLophotrochozoa, a form of Ecdysozoa, Vertebrata, Mollusca, Bivalvia,\nGastropoda, Arachnida, Hexapoda, Coleoptera, and Diptera) but do not\nsupport monophyly for Deuterostomia, Arthropoda or Nemertea. Parametric\nbootstrapping tests reject monophyly for Arthropoda and Nemertea, but\nare unable to reject deuterostome monophyly. The sodium-potassium ATPase\nalpha subunit gene appears to be useful for deep-level studies of\nmetazoan phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 4: Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid MP\nStrict Consensus Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4159.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP6","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony\nTree #6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4160.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP5","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony Tree #5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4161.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony\nTree #4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4162.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP3","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony\nTree #3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4163.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony\nTree #1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4165.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaGoloboff1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Goloboff\nParsimony Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4166.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaMP2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Maximum Parsimony\nTree #2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4164.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPaaWAGTP","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Amino Acid Quartet Puzzling\nTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 1 & 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bilateran Metazoan ATPase Nucleotide Reduced 2 ML\nTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 3: Bilaterian Metazoan ATPase Nucleotide Reduced\n1 ML Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4158.phy"}]}
