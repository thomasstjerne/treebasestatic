Here\nwe describe a new species of horned dinosaur, Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum\nthat exhibits an apomorphic character in the frill, as well as a unique\ncombination of other characters. Phylogenetic analysis of 16 taxa of\nceratopsians failed to resolve relationships between P. perotorum and\nother Pachyrhinosaurus species (P. canadensis and P. lakustai). P.\nperotorum shares characters with each of the previously known species\nthat are not present in the other, including very large nasal and\nsupraorbital bosses that are nearly in contact and separated only by a\nnarrow groove as in P. canadensis, and a rostral comb formed by the\nnasals and premaxillae as in P. lakustai. P. perotorum is the youngest\ncentrosaurine known (70-69 Ma), and the locality that produced the\ntaxon, the Kikak-Tegoseak Quarry, is close to the highest latitude for\nrecovery of ceratopsid remains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pachyrhinosaurus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55086.phy"}]}
