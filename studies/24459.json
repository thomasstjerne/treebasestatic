Naming these\nphylo-species is complicated due to the lack of type material for F.\nchlamydosporum. Over the years a number of F. chlamydosporum isolates\nhave been accessioned in the culture collection of the Westerdijk Fungal\nBiodiversity Institute which were formerly identified based on\nmorphology only. The present study was undertaken to correctly identify\nthese ‘F. chlamydosporum’ isolates based on multilocus phylogenetic\ninference supported by morphological characteristics. Closer scrutiny of\nthe metadata associated with one of these isolates allowed us to propose\na neotype for F. chlamydosporum. Phylogenetic inference revealed the\npresence of nine phylo-species within the FCSC in this study. Of these,\neight could be provided with names supported by subtle morphological\ncharacters. In addition, a new species, as F. nodosum, is introduced in\nthe F. sambucinum species complex and F. chlamydosporum var. fuscum is\nraised to species level in the F. incarnatum-equiseti species complex\n(FIESC).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium chlamydosporum species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119010.phy"}]}
