Based on the BLAST search and morphological\nobservations, the fungus was identified as E. quercicola. This is the\nfirst record of E. quercicola on species of subgenus Cyclobalanopsis.\nPrevious studies revealed that E. quercicola is plurivorous infecting a\nwide range of tropical fruit trees and woody plants covering 9 families\nand 11 genera as well as hosts of subgenus Quercus. Further studies are\nneeded to address the question as to why only E. quercicola infect\nspecies of subgenus Cyclobalanopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe quercicola ITA+28S 45taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105662.phy"}]}
