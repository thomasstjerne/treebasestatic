It repre- sents a new and, more primitive than\nother known, member of this group and extends the lifespan of this\nfamily to 11 Ma, the longest of any known Early Cretaceous avian\nlineages. Furthermore, Eocon- fuciusornis and its relatives present many\nosteological transformations, such as the size increase of the\ndeltopectoral crest of the humerus and the keel of the sternum,\napparently an adaptation toward improved flight in the evolution of the\nConfuciusornithidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56310.phy"}]}
