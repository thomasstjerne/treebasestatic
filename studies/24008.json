Decades of work untangling the ecology and\nevolution of these organisms has simultaneously contributed to\ndevelopment of the fields of mutualism, coevolution, and plant-insect\ninteractions at large. With more than 800 species, figs (Ficus,\nMoraceae) are among some of the larger genera of angiosperms.\nPhylogenetic studies of Moraceae have supported the clade Castilleae as\nthe sister lineage of figs. Compared to figs, Castilleae has many fewer\nspecies (60 species and 11 genera), suggesting changes in rates of\ndiversification along these two branches. Relatively little is known\nabout Castilleae compared to Ficus, and we argue that defining the clade\ncomprising figs and Castilleae, hereafter Involucraoideae, focuses\nattention on opportunities for comparative studies of pollination\nmutualisms and diversification rates. In this study, we define\nInvolucraoideae and propose a revised classification scheme that\naccounts for the phylogenetic reconstruction based on the most\ncomprehensive sampling of this group to date. Moving forward, this\nclassification will better guide and support evolutionary, ecological,\nand comparative pollination biology studies of this most notable\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae ITS ML Tree","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae ITS ML Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115935.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ficus Bayesian Tree","ntax":"311","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115928.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae G3pdh Bayesian Tree","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae G3pdh Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115931.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae G3pdh ML Tree","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae G3pdh ML Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115930.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae GBSSI Bayesian Tree","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae GBSSI Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115933.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae GBSSI ML Tree","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae GBSSI ML Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115932.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae 3 gene Bayesian Tree","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae 3 gene Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115937.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae ITS Bayesian Tree","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae ITS Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115934.phy"},{"tree_label":"Involucraoideae 3 gene ML Tree","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Involucraoideae 3 gene ML Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_115936.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ficus Maximum Likelihood Tree","ntax":"310","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ficus Maximum Likelihood Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_116131.phy"}]}
