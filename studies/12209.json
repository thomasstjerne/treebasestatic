The affinities of one of the\nmost enigmatic lineages, surf silversides (Notocheiridae), have proven\nparticularly elusive due to this taxons unique morphology and rarity in\nmuseum collections. In this study, we use mitochondrial and nuclear\nsequence data to generate a phylogeny for seven of the eight families of\nAtheriniformes. Our results reveal that four families within\nAtheriniformes (Atherinopsidae, Notocheiridae, Atherinidae,\nMelanotaeniidae) are not monophyletic. Most notably, Notocheiridae is\npolyphyletic, with Notocheirus hubbsi nested within New World\nsilversides (Atherinopsidae), while members of Iso are sister to all\nother Old World Atheriniforms. These data suggest that the unique\nmorphology of Notocheirus and Iso is a result of adaptive convergent\nevolution to the high-energy surf habitat where these species live.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50216","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50216.phy"}]}
