Here we establish a\nmolecular clock for the moths based on mtDNA, and use it to estimate the\ntime of major life history events within the yucca moths. Colonization\nof yuccas had occurred 41.5±9.8 Mya, with rapid life habit\ndiversification and the emergence of pollinators within 0-6 My after\nyucca colonization. A subsequent burst of diversification 3.2±1.8 Mya\ncoincided with evolution of arid habitats in western North America.\nDerived non-pollinating cheater yucca moths evolved 1.26 ± 0.96 Mya. The\nestimated age of the moths far predates the host fossil record, but is\nconsistent with suggested host age based on paleobotanical,\nclimatological, biogeographical, and geological data, and a tentative\nestimation from an rbcL-based molecular clock. The moth data are used to\nestablish three alternative scenarios of how the moths and plants have\ncoevolved. They yield specific predictions that can be tested once a\nrobust plant phylogeny becomes available.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Prodoxidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3674.phy"}]}
