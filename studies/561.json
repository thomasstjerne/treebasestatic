It was described originally\nas Lecophagus fasciculatus and classified as a Zygomycete. To address\nthe systematic position of this fungus and to infer the phylogenetic\nrelationsips within other hyphomycetes, we determined and analyzed 18S\nrDNA sequences of C. muscicola and several of its predacious and\nnonpredacious relatives. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that C.\nmuscicola forms a monophyletic clade with nematophagous hyphomycetes,\nsuch as Arthrobotrys spp. This result indicates that the predacious\nnature of these fungi might be plesiomorphic for this lineage. The\nnonpredacious species of Cephaliophora, including the type species C.\ntropica, are distantly related to this lineage. Therefore the\nrotifer-capturing species of Cephaliophora, C. muscicola and C.\nlongispora, are transferred to the anamorphic genus Lecophagus, and we\nhave emended the genus accordingly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Discomycetes and pradacious hyphomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3471.phy"}]}
