In this study,\nforty-three cultures of Colletotrichum were isolated from areca palm\nleaves with anthracnose symptoms in eleven areca palm plantations in\neight counties in Hainan, China. The isolates were characterized based\non morphological characters, phylogenetic analysis of six loci (ITS,\nACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2 and ApMat) and pathogenicity tests. Eight\nColletotrichum species were delemeted, of which five previously known\nspecies (C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C.\nsiamense and C. tropicale), an unidentified species of Colletotrichum\nand a new species, C. arecicola, in the gloeosporioides species complex\nand C. karstii in the boninense species complex. Colletotrichum siamense\nwas the most common species associated with areca palm in Hainan,\nfollowed by C. arecicola. Pathogenicity test showed that all species\ncould cause anthracnose symptoms on areca palm leaves but isolates from\nthe gloeosporioides species complex caused larger lesions than isolates\nfrom the boninense species complex. Further research is needed to\nunderstand the epidemiology of these pathogenic species on areca palm in\norder to develop management strategies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120835","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120835.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120832.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119668.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120834","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120834.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120836","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120836.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120838.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120839.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120837.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126522","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120833.phy"}]}
