The pathogenic fungus Ophiocordyceps\nmizoramensis infected the host Polistes olivaceus (paper wasp) causing\ndeath to the whole colony within the hive.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mintre","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiocordyceps mizoramensis 12x475","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121056.phy"},{"tree_label":"mintr","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiocordyceps mizoramensis Ml analysis using Mr\nbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118236.phy"}]}
