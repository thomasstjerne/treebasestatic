Special emphasis was on\nphylogenetic relationships within the H. crustuliniforme complex. In\ntotal 52 collections were analysed, representing 39 taxa. Agrocybe\npraecox and two species of Alnicola were used as outgroups. The genus\nHebeloma appears to be monophyletic. Several well supported clades could\nbe recognized. However, many of the basal relationships are unresolved\nor only weakly supported. Alternative topologies could not be rejected.\nIt is therefore impossible to derive a revised infrageneric\nclassification of Hebeloma. The H. crustuliniforme complex appears\nparaphyletic, consisting of two clades with three and 17\nInterCompatibility Groups respectively. In the second clade many of the\nphylogenetic relationships are also unresolved, reflecting a high rate\nof recent speciation events. Most of the species in this clade form\nectomycorrhizae with members of the Salicaceae. The taxon that is basal\nto this clade, however, is not associated with these hosts. The host\ntree switch to Salicaceae has been followed by extensive and rapid\nspeciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3542.phy"}]}
