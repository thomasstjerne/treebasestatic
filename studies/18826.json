During\ndisease surveys in northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory\nof Australia, symptoms resembling those of T. destructans were observed\non young and adult leaves of native and plantation Eucalyptus spp. and\nits hybrids. Phylogenetic studies revealed Teratosphaeria species\nassociated with these symptoms are new taxonomic novelties described\nhere as T. novaehollandiae sp. nov. and T. tiwiana sp. nov. Isolates\nfrom previous records of T. destructans recorded in Australia were\nre-examined and based upon the phylogenetic evidence are reassigned to\nthese new taxa. We therefore conclude that T. destructans is absent from\nAustralia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94003","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94003.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97595.phy"}]}
