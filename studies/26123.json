Telamonia, based on morphological\nand ecological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses. Cortinarius\nlaccariphyllus sp. nov. (section Colymbadini) is associated with\nbroadleaf trees, with strongly hygrophanous basidiomata, special\nLaccaria-like lamellae, white and with an extremely sparse universal\nveil. Cortinarius pseudotorvus sp. nov. (section Telamonia) is\nassociated with broadleaf trees and is easily confused with C. torvus,\nbut can be distinguished by the colour of the fresh basidiomes and the\nstipe usually somewhat tapering towards the base. Cortinarius\nsubfuscoperonatus sp. nov. (section Fuscoperonati) is associated with\nconiferous trees, with subglobose to broadly ellipsoid spores and is\nclosely related to C. fuscoperonatus. A key to the new species and\nsimilar species in sect. Colymbadini, sect. Telamonia and sect.\nFuscoperonati is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128366.phy"}]}
