The new taxa were assigned to\nsection Echinospori due to the verrucose basidiospores and presence of\nclamp connections in the hyphae. Comprehensive description, photographs\nand comparisons with phenetically similar and phylogenetically related\nspecies are discurssed. The nrLSU based phylogenetic analysis performed\nusing Maximum Likelihood (ML) method, supported the novelty of the\nspecies","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114310","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114310.phy"}]}
