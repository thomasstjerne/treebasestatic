Many of them have been historically\ndescribed, but due to their morphological plasticity there is no\ncomplete understanding about their relationship and taxonomic status.\nCommonly applied names, particularly in the southern Neotropics, come\nfrom species of north-hemisphere distribution (i.e.: G. lucidum, G.\nresinaceum and G. applanatum). The aim of this work was to determine the\ndiversity of the Ganoderma genus in Uruguay through ITS-based\nphylogenies in combination with morphological, ecological and\ndistribution data. The results confirm the presence of 4 reddish laccate\nspecies (G. dorsale, G. platense, G. martinicense and G. mexicanum) and\n2 opaque species (G. australe s.l.). The species are morphologically\ndifferentiated mainly by its stipe, pilear surface, context, pores,\nbasidiospores and cutis cells. Regarding the ecological data, the\nspecies present differences in substrate preferences. In addition, a\ncomprehensive taxonomic discussion regarding phylogenetical position and\ntaxonomic status is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"140","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma species from Uruguay","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125102.phy"}]}
