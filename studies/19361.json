Here we propose Tuber\npolymorphosporus, and T. baoshanense as new species. These species are\ndescribed from Yunnan Province and differ in a combination of\nmorphologically features including ascoma color, peridium structure and\nascospore shape and size. These two new taxa have phylogenetic affinity\nto T. latisporum and T. polymorphosporus respectively, described from\nthe southwest China. Phylogenetic placement of these novel Tuber species\nin the Latisporum group are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tuber_ITS","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber_ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96372.phy"}]}
