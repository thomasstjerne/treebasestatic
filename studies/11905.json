Based on the culture, light and transmission electron\nmicroscopy and phylogenetic analyses was carried out. Thaumatomastix\nspecies are confined within the order Thaumatomonadida of the class\nImbricatea and phylum Cercozoa. They are heterotrophic and their cell\nbodies are covered with silica scales. Observations of thin sections as\nwell as whole-mounts indicate that the morphology and ultrastructure of\nUIO286 is identical to T. salina, which was initially described from\nsalt pools in Denmark. Detailed examination revealed some new features\nsuch as the presence of pseudopodia and silica deposition vesicles\nproducing spine scales. The phylogeny presented here includes ribosomal\nDNA sequences from both imbricatean cultures and environmental samples.\nThe 18S rDNA phylogenetic tree suggests that (i) Thaumatomastix is\nparaphyletic within the Thaumastomonadida clade, (ii) there is no close\naffinity between T. salina and other cultured and sequenced strains, but\nit is closely related to a sequence obtained from environmental DNA; we\npropose the present strain to serve as a reference culture of\nThaumatomastix species and T. salina. Further, we discuss the\ndistribution, habitats and evolution of scale formation among euglyphids\nand thaumatomonads.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaumatomonad","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48613.phy"}]}
