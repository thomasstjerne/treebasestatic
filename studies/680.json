Phylogenetic relationships among these species are\ncontroversial and have not been tested using molecular data. In this\nstudy we used sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region of\nnuclear ribosomal DNA to test previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Two\nsister species pairs are well supported: B. distichophylla plus B.\ngraebneriana, and B. lanceolata plus B. henryi. Sequence differences and\nmorphological characters support the recognition of B. lanceolata and B.\nhenryi. Sequence divergence between B. distichophylla and B.\ngraebneriana is twice as high as that between B. lanceolata and B.\nhenryi. These results are most consistent with the treatment proposed by\nCarvell and Eshbaugh. Biogeographically, one of the Chinese species (B.\ngraebneriana) is most closely related to the eastern North American\nspecies (B. distichophylla), while the other Chinese species (B. henryi)\nis allied with the Japanese species (B. lanceolata). Maximum likelihood\nanalyses do not reject clock-like evolution of nrDNA ITS spacers in\nBuckleya, and divergence times may date to the Late Miocene and\nPliocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buckleya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3690.phy"}]}
