Despite their critical importance for identifying the\nclosest living relatives of land plants, phylogenetic studies of\ncharophytes have provided equivocal results [1-5]. In addition, many\nrelationships remain unresolved among the land plants, such as the\nposition of mosses, liverworts and of the enigmatic Gnetales.\nPhylogenomics has proven to be an insightful approach for resolving\nchallenging phylogenetic issues, particularly concerning deep nodes\n[6-8]. Here we extend this approach to the green lineage by assembling a\nmultilocus data set of 77 nuclear genes (12,149 unambiguously aligned\namino acid positions) from 77 taxa of plants. We therefore provide the\nfirst multigene phylogenetic evidence that Coleochaetales represent the\nclosest living relatives of land plants. Moreover, our data reinforce\nthe early divergence of liverworts and the close relationship between\nGnetales and Pinaceae. These results provide a new phylogenetic\nframework and represent a key step for the evolutionary interpretation\nof developmental and genomic characters in green plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Phylobayes CAT","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25620.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phylobayes CAT","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25618.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML PROTMIXWAG","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25617.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML PROTMIXWAG","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25619.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML PROTMIXWAG","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25623.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phylobayes CAT","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25622.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML PROTMIXWAG","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25621.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phylobayes CAT","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Land Plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25616.phy"}]}
