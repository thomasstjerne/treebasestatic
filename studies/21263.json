This species has hitherto been characterized by\nhaving straight conidiophore foot cells. However, we found that recent\ncollections from Germany have conidiophores with sinuated and twisted\nfoot cells. So far sinuated foot cells were only known from the related\nP. fraxinicola, another species with Eastern Asian origin. We thus\nhypothesized that recent collections from Germany belong to P.\nfraxinicola which might have been introduced to Europe. Using\nmorphological and molecular rDNA data we found that no introduction took\nplace and that there is only P. fraxini in Germany.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllactinia fraxinicola ITS+28S 24 taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105661.phy"}]}
