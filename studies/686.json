However,\nbased on additional sequence from a second locus, actin, T. jamesii is\nseen to consist of many phylogenetic species. A clade of six to seven\nclosely related phylogenetic species of T. jamesii are symbiotic with\nfive of the six phylogenetic species of Letharia. Within this broad\nlevel of specificity, there are also narrower patterns of specificity.\nFor example, three cryptic species of T. jamesii were found only in two\nspecies of Letharia in California, a pattern that may be due either to\nbiogeography, or to Letharia phylogenetically tracking Trebouxia.\nAllopatric Letharia vulpina has switched to a genetically distant\nphylogenetic species within the T. jamesii morphospecies, suggesting\nthat habitat plays a role in specificity. One phylogenetic species of T.\njamesii was found to have a recombining population structure, as two\nalleles of two loci were found in all four pairwise combinations among\nthe haploid genotypes of that species. This result suggests that\nTrebouxia, a genus in which sexual structures have never been observed,\nis nevertheless recombining.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"fungal and green algal actin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3707.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3706.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxia jamesii actin intron 738","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3708.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7 L","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxi jamesii ‘letharii’ ITS + actin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3709.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxia jamesii ’letharii’actin intron 569","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3710.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7 R","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Letharia 6-locus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3711.phy"}]}
