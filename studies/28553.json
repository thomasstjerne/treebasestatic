Occulti-bambusa\nhongheensis and Seriascoma bambusae spp. nov. are introduced based on\nmorphological characteristics coupled with multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalyses of combined LSU, SSU, TEF1-Î±, RPB2 and ITS sequence data.\nOccultibambusa kunmingensis is also reported from a terrestrial habitat\nfor the first time. Comprehensive descriptions, color photo plates of\nmicromorphology, and a phylogenetic tree showing the placements of these\nthree taxa are provided. In addition, synopsis tables of Occultibambusa\nand Seriascoma with morphological features are also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132239","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132239.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132238.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132240","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132240.phy"}]}
