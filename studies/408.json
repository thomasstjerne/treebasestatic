These lice, hosted by\ngalliform, columbiform and tinamiform birds are reputedly basal in the\nphylogeny of Ischnocera. A cladistic analysis of sixty-two adult\nmorphological characters from thirty-one taxa revealed thirty equally\nparsimonious trees. The phylogeny is well resolved within the\nHeptapsogasteridae and supports the monophyly of the subfamily\nStrongylocotinae (sensu Eichler, 1963). Resolution within the Goniodidae\nis lower but suggests that the genera hosted by Columbiformes are\nlargely monophyletic. Mapping host taxonomy on to the phylogeny of the\nlice reveals a consistent pattern which is largely congruent down to the\nrank of host family, although at lower taxonomic levels the association\nappears to be more complex. The inclusion of more louse taxa may\nconsiderably help to unravel the coevolutionary history of both the\nhosts and their parasites.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 13 Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniodidae & Heptapsogasteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3401.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13 Adams","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniodidae & Heptapsogasteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3402.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 14 Island 1 Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniodidae & Heptapsogasteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3403.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 14 Island 2 Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniodidae & Heptapsogasteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3404.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15 Clados Style","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniodidae & Heptapsogasteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3405.phy"}]}
