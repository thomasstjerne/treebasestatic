The results\nsupport a morphology-based phylogeny, presented elsewhere, with\nYelicones being divided into two major groups corresponding to the New\nand Old World faunas. The African and Asian species largely form\nseparate clades except for Yelicones wui Chen & He from China which\nis associated with the Afrotropical species. Potential molecular\nsynapomorphies are illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Parasitic Wasp Yelicones","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2267.phy"}]}
