The species is characterized by\nits, applanate stromata with fulvous to rust color, perithecia,\nsubglobose to obovoid, asci without apical apparatus, not bluing in\nMelzerÂ’s iodine reagent, perispore dehiscent in 10% KOH, with conspicuous\ncoil-like ornamentation. The differences between the new species and\nsome morphologically similar Hypoxylon species are discussed.\nPhylogenetic analyses of ITS gene region demonstrated that H. puerense\nformed a single lineage and was sister to H. ticinense with strong\nstatistical supports (100% BS, 100% BT, 1.00 BPP).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134588.phy"}]}
