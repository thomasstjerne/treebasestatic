We obtained choke bearing grasses\nBrachypodium sylvaticum (Huds.) P. Beauv. grown in Huangshan, Anhui in\n2006. Mature stromata were developed on their culms and inflorescences,\nand obligately associated with host plants throughout areas higher than\nelevation of 1500 m. Nineteen fungal strains were isolated from those\nplants. Morphological characteristics of these fungal strains including\ncolony, conidium and conidiophore, pertherium and asci, growth rate on\nPDA plate, host specificity, and phylogenetic characteristics based on\ntubB and tefA fragments were mostly coincident with Epichloï¿½ sylvatica\nLeuchtm. et Schardl. These fungal characteristics of the Chinese origin\nE. sylvatica isolates were firstly documented in detail. The\nphylogenetic analysis demonstrated that E. sylvatica within Chinese B.\nsylvaticum is closely related with Japanese isolate, but different from\nEuropean strains, indicating the geographic separation may play an\nimportant role in fungal evolution. Here we proposed Epichloï¿½\nsylvatica var. huangshanense for this separate variety.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tub tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe sylvatica var. huangshanense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26498.phy"},{"tree_label":"tef tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe sylvatica var. huangshanense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26497.phy"}]}
