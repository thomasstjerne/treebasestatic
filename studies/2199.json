Although lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) are known to\ncospeciate with their hosts and have frequently served as important\nmarkers to infer host evolutionary history, most molecular studies are\nbased on only one or two markers. Resulting phylogenies may therefore\nrepresent gene, rather than species, histories and analyses of multiple\nmolecular markers are needed to increase confidence in the results of\nphylogenetic analyses. Herein, we phylogenetically examine nine\nmolecular markers in primate sucking lice (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) and\nwe use these markers to estimate divergence times among louse lineages.\nIndividual and combined analyses of these nine markers are, for the most\npart, congruent, supporting relationships hypothesized in previous\nstudies. Only one marker, the nuclear protein-coding gene Histone 3, has\na significantly different topology compared to the other markers, and we\nrecommend cautious use of this gene in future studies. Additionally, we\nfind that simultaneous use of multiple markers and calibration points\nprovides the most reliable estimates of louse divergence times, in\nagreement with previous studies estimating species divergences.\nEstimates of phylogenies and divergence times also allow us to verify\nthe results of Reed et al.Â (2007); there was contact between gorilla and\nhumans roughly 3 Ma resulting in a host switch of Pthirus lice from\ngorillas to humans. Thus, these results provide further evidence that\ncospeciating organisms can yield important information about the\nevolutionary history of their hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, CO3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3133.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3134.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2f","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, CAD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3135.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2i","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3139.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, EF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3136.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2h","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, Wg","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3138.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2g","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, RPII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3137.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3130.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primate Sucking Lice, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3131.phy"}]}
