Phylogenetic relationships among 21 Steinernema\nspecies were estimated using 28S ribosomal DNA sequences and\nmorphological characters. Sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed\nspacers were obtained to provide additional molecular characters to\nresolve relationships among S. carpocapsae, S. scapterisci, S.\nsiamkayai, andS. monticolum. Four equally parsimonious trees resulted\nfrom combined analysis of 28S sequences and 22 morphological characters.\nClades inferred from analyses of molecular sequences and combined\ndatasets were primarily reliably supported as assessed by bootstrap\nresampling, whereas those inferred from morphological data alone were\nnot. Although partially consistent with some traditional expectations\nand previous phylogenetic studies, the hypotheses inferred from\nmolecular evidence, and those from combined analysis of morphological\nand molecular data, provide a new and comprehensive framework for\nevaluating character evolution of steinernematids. Interpretation of\nmorphological character evolution on 6 trees inferred from sequence data\nand combined evidence suggests that many structural features of these\nnematodes are highly homoplastic, and that some structures previously\nused to hypothesize relationships represent ancestral\ncharacter-states.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Combined evidence tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3759.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined evidence tree 3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3761.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined evidence tree 4","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3762.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU FA MP tree 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3750.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU FA MP tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3749.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU FA MP tree 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3751.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU FA MP tree 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3752.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3753.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology MP tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3754.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology MP tree 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3755.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology MP tree 3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3756.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3758.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined evidence tree 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3760.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3763.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3764.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernematidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3765.phy"}]}
