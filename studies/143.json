The results are illustrated with\na cladogram and a strict consensus tree. A detailed character discussion\nis presented. Descriptions of all genera are supplied with brief notes\non distribution, references to chemical investigations, and chromosome\nnumbers. Lists of recognized species are also presented in connection to\neach genus, respectively. 21 new combinations are made, one new genus,\nXerolekia A. ANDERB., is described, Mollera is reduced to a synonym of\nCalostephane, and the genus Duhaldea is resuscitated. Anisopappus was\nfound to be a paraphyletic basal group in the tribe. The paleate genera\nAsteriscus, Nauplills, lghermia, Buphthalmum and Xerolekia form one\nmonophyletic group. lnula and other, similar genera were found to\nconstitute the ancestral complex of the Pulicaria group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inuleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inuleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1587.phy"}]}
