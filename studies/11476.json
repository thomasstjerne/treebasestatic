The application of\nmolecular phylogenetic techniques has identified the origins of numerous\nallopolyploids, but little is known on genomic and chromosomal\nconsequences of allopolyploidization, despite their important role in\nconferring divergence of allopolyploids from their parental species.\nHere, using several plastid and nuclear sequence markers, we clarify the\norigin of tetra- and hexaploids in a group of American daisies, allowing\ncharacterization of genome dynamics in polyploids compared to their\ndiploid ancestors. All polyploid species are allopolyploids. Among the\nfour diploid gene pools, the propensity for allopolyploidization is\nunevenly distributed phylogenetically with a few species apparently more\nprone to participate, but the underlying causes remain unclear.\nPolyploid genomes are characterized by differential loss of ribosomal\nDNA loci (5S and 35S rDNA), known hotspots of chromosomal evolution, but\nshow genome size additivity, suggesting the presence of processes\ncounterbalancing genome reduction. Patterns of ribosomal DNA sequence\nconversion and provenance of the lost loci are highly idiosyncratic and\ndiffer even between allopolyploids of identical parentage, indicating\nthat allopolyploids deriving from the same lower-ploid parental species\ncan follow different evolutionary trajectories.","trees":[{"tree_label":"pgiCI MP","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46246","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46246.phy"},{"tree_label":"pgiCII MP","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46247.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BI","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46200","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46200.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MP","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46201.phy"},{"tree_label":"cp data MP","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46203","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46203.phy"},{"tree_label":"pgiCII BI","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46248.phy"},{"tree_label":"5S spacer MP","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46244","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46244.phy"},{"tree_label":"5S spacer BI","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46243","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46243.phy"},{"tree_label":"cp data BI","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46202","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46202.phy"},{"tree_label":"pgiCI BI","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46245","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46245.phy"}]}
