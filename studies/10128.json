In addition to surveying all\ncurrently accepted taxa within Limnanthaceae, an anomalous population of\n4-petalous plants from Half Moon Bay, San Mateo County, California, was\nalso included. Further, a series of crossing experiments were performed\nbetween Half Moon Bay plants and two closely related species (Limnanthes\nbakeri and L. macounii). The results of this study confirm the monophyly\nof two sections within Limnanthes and also suggest that Limnanthaceae\nmay contain as few as four species of Limnanthes and the monotypic genus\nFloerkea proserpinacoides. Additionally, the molecular phylogenetic\nresults and crossing experiments do not support taxonomic recognition of\nthe Half Moon Bay population, rather it is part of a highly polymorphic\nLimnanthes douglasii sensu lato.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Limnanthes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6130.phy"}]}
