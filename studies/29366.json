Among the yeasts isolated in this study,\n31 strains were identified as 9 known species in the class Ascomycota\n(20/31) or Basidiomycota (11/31). The remaining 10 strains were found to\nrepresent three novel species in three clades of the class Ascomycota\nbased on morphological and phylogenetic analyses (ITS and nuc 28S),\nthree new species are proposed: Starmerella elongatum, Kazachstania\nparagamospora and Pichia mexicensis. Descriptions of these novel yeast\nspecies are provided along with discussion of their ecology in relation\nto the fermentation of pulque and their biochemical roles in this\nprocess.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135472.phy"}]}
