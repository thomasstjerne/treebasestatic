Photographs,\nline drawings, and detailed morphological descriptions for these species\nwere provided and compared against closely related taxa. The\nphylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region also\nsupported the recognition of these new species. The authors also report\nR. indocatillus for the first time from China; morphological and\nphylogenetic data are provided for the Chinese specimens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131001","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131001.phy"}]}
