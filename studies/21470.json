During recent\nsurveys, Fusarium species were associated with weevil damage in A.\ncruentus fields. Preliminary studies showed that some of these Fusarium\nspecies grouped into two distinct clades within the Fusarium fujikuroi\nspecies complex. The aim of this study was to characterise these\nisolates based on morphology and phylogeny of the Translation Elongation\nFactor 1α (TEF1α) gene region and ß-tubulin 2 region of the ß- tubulin\n(ßT) gene and to determine if these isolates are pathogenic to A.\ncruentus. Phylogenetic and morphological studies showed that these two\nclades represent two novel species described here as F. casha and F.\ncurculicola. Both species were shown to be pathogenic to A. cruentus. A\nstrong association is evident with these two species and weevils, but\nfurther research is needed to understand the role of weevils in disease\ndevelopment involving F. casha and F. curculicola in A. cruentus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106507.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106505.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106518.phy"}]}
