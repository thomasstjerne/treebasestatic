Surprisingly few studies have used\nphylogenetic analyses to discern the details of evolutionary\ndiversification in ornaments and armaments subject to sexual selection,\nand the origins of novel sperm traits and their subsequent modification\nare particularly poorly understood. Here we investigate sperm evolution\nin diving beetles (Dytiscidae), revealing dramatic diversification in\nflagellum length, head shape, presence of sperm heteromorphism, and the\npresence/type of sperm conjugation, an unusual trait where two or more\nsperm unite for motility or transport. Sperm conjugation was found to be\nthe ancestral condition in diving beetles, with subsequent\ndiversification into three forms, each exhibiting varying degrees of\nevolutionary loss, convergence and recurrence. Sperm head shape, but not\nlength or heteromorphism, was found to evolve in a significantly\ncorrelated manner with conjugation, consistent with the different\nmechanisms of head alignment and binding required for the different\nforms of conjugation. Our study reveals that sperm morphological\nevolution is channeled along particular evolutionary pathways (i.e.,\nconjugate form), yet subject to considerable diversification within\nthose pathways through modification in sperm length, head shape and\nheteromorphism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dytiscidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49838.phy"}]}
