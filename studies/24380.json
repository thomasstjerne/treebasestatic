Here we use\nextensive mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data (8878 bp) to show\nthat four species should be recognized. Our fully resolved and\nwell-supported tree shows that the American Anhinga (Anhinga anhinga) is\nsister to the three Old-World species, with the Oriental (A.\nmelanogaster) and African (A. rufa) Darters sister within the Old-World\nclade, which also includes the Australian Darter (A. novaehollandiae).\nWe estimate that the divergence between the New-World and Old-World\nbranches occurred 19-22 mya, with the Australian Darter separating from\nits Old-World congeners 14-16 mya and the Oriental and African species\nsplitting ~10 mya. The genus is yet another example of osteological\nconservatism in the Suliformes, which is comparable to that shown by the\ncormorants and shags. Nevertheless, the relationships we infer are\ncongruent with recent plumage studies and are biogeographically\nplausible. We suggest that further investigation of the variation within\nthe African and Australian Darters would be of interest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anhingidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117220.phy"}]}
