The genus\nSphaerulina (3- to multi-septate ascospores) was thus distinguished from\nMycosphaerella (1-septate ascospores). Several species in Sphaerulina\nhave been found to have anamorphs commonly associated with\nMycosphaerella. Sequence data derived from the rDNA (ITS 1, 5.8S and ITS\n2) gene suggest that Sphaerulina is heterogeneous, and that species with\nMycosphaerella-like anamorphs belong in Mycosphaerella, while those with\nyeast-like anamorphs belong to the Dothioraceae. Mycosphaerella\nsphaerulinae and its Pseudocercospora sphaerulinae anamorph are newly\ndescribed from leaf spots of Eucalyptus globulus and E. nitens in Chile.\nSphaerulina eucalypti, which occurs on Eucalyptus leaves in South\nAfrica, is transferred to Sydowia. This species is also newly linked to\nits anamorph, Selenophoma eucalypti. This study contributes to growing\nphylogenetic evidence that ascospore septation is a poor indicator of\ngeneric status in the Ascomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideales, NJ with Kimura-2-parameter model","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1221.phy"}]}
