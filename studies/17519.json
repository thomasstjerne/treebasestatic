This fungus produced fast-growing colonies that were grayish\nviolet to dark blue in culture and rapidly reproduced via production of\ncopious ballistoconidia. Phylogenetic analyses of the large and small\nsubunits and internal transcribed spacer regions of the nuclear rDNA\ncistron, translation elongation factor 1-α and β-tubulin sequences\nindicate this fungus is a member of Ustilaginomycetes, but holds an\nisolated position, distinct from the two currently recognized orders,\nUstilaginales and Urocystales. Here we describe Violaceomycetales ord.\nnov., Violaceomycetaceae fam. nov. and Violaceomyces palustris gen. et\nsp. nov. for this unusual fungus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Violaceomycetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87351.phy"}]}
