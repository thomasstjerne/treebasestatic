With Chaetomium\nthermophilum, Thielavia terrestris and Thielavia heterothallica three\ngenome sequences of thermophilic eukaryotes have been published. A\nphylogenetics-guided comparison of their proteomes with those of other,\nmesophilic Sordariomycetes revealed consistent amino acid substitutions\nassociated to thermophily that were also present in an independent\nlineage of thermophilic fungi. The most consistent pattern is the\nsubstitution of lysine by arginine, which we could find in almost all\nlineages but has not been extensively used in protein stability\nengineering. By exploiting mutational paths towards the thermophiles, we\ncould predict particular amino acid residues in individual proteins that\ncontribute to thermostability and validated some of them experimentally.\nBy determining the three-dimensional structure of an exemplar protein\nfrom C. Thermophilum (Arx1), we could also characterise the molecular\nconsequences of some of these mutations. Thus, the comparative analysis\nof these three genomes not only enhances our understanding of the\nevolution of thermophily, but also provides new ways to engineer protein\nstability.","trees":[{"tree_label":"v1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69412.phy"}]}
