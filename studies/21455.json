Recently, outbreaks of anthracnose\ndisease in A. compressus have been observed in Hainan and Guangdong\nprovinces in southern China. During late winter and early spring, in\nsome badly infected lawns, the incidence of anthracnose on carpetgrass\napproached 100%. Under high-moisture conditions, the crowns and oldest\nleaf sheaths of affected carpetgrass become necrotic, which led to whole\nlawns turning reddish brown. We first confirmed pathogenicity by\ninoculating a conidial suspension of the fungal species onto uninfected\nA. compressus. Next, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the\ncombined ITS, Sod2, Apn2, and Apn2/Mat1 regions and confirmed the\npathogen to be a novel species in the falcate-spored graminicolous group\nof the genus Colletotrichum. Microscopic examination showed that the\nspecies was also morphologically distinct from other similar species of\nColletotrichum. As a result of the molecular, phylogenetic,\nmorphological, and pathogenicity analyses, we proposed the name\nColletotrichum hainanense sp. nov for this undescribed fungal pathogen\nin this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109574","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109574.phy"}]}
