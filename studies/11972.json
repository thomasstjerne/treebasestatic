Several obvious errors are corrected and\nmethodological weaknesses are revealed. BLAST searches on the sequences\npublished in that paper and now in GenBank, showed high percentages of\nsimilarity of the alleged species with taxa that are considered only\ndistantly related in the literature. Inspection of the so-called voucher\nspecimens showed that some shells were misidentified, whereas others\ncontained dirt or were bleached, indicating that these had been\ncollected empty. Obviously the sequences published for those species\ncould not have originated from those spec- imens, which cannot be\nconsidered vouchers therefore, even if they are from the same locality.\nIn other instances, spurious sequences were published for correctly\nidentified voucher specimens. For several spe- cies for which we\ncollected specimens ourselves, the COI or the 16S sequence, or both,\nclearly differed from the results published by Steinke et al. The\nconsequences of our results for the molecular data on hel- icid\ngastropods and their classification are listed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48902","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48902.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48903.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48904.phy"}]}
