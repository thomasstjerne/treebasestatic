A monophyletic group of\nfive species with spinose forelegs is proposed, including M. angusta,\nnewly transferred from Arachosia, plus four new species: M. charrua, M.\nguenoana, M. fierro and M. carolina. One new species, M. tandil (from\nBuenos Aires Province), is proposed to be the sister group of Monapia\nvittata. A data matrix with 43 characters for the 13 species of the\ngenus (plus 9 amaurobioidine outgroups) was cladistically analyzed.\nAlthough relationships among species are mostly resolved, the basal\nphylogeny of the genus remains unclear. The previous hypothesis of\nrelationships of Monapia alupuran is unsupported in this new analysis.\nAdditional records are given for M. lutea and M. dilaticollis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monapia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1097.phy"}]}
