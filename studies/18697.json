Gloeoporus citrinoalbus is characterized by the\nlemon yellow pore surface and white margin of the fresh fruiting body,\ntiny pores (810 per mm), a monomitic hyphal system with clamped\ngenerative hyphae, presence of gloeocystidia, and allantoid\nbasidiospores measured as 3.84.1 × 0.81 µm. Gloeoporus hainanensis is\ncharacterized by white to cream pore surface, tiny pores (911 per mm), a\nmonomitic hyphal system with simple septate hyphae, and allantoid\nbasidiospores measured as 3.74.7 × 0.91.1 µm. Both morphological\ncharacters and phylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS and nLSU\nsequences confirmed the placement of the two new species in Gloeoporus\nand showed their relationships with similar species in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93841.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93840.phy"}]}
