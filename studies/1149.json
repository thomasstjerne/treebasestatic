Specimens were found on the slopes\nof Mount Victoria between elevations of 709 m and 1,940 m in areas of\nsecondary forest in close proximity to human habitation. The new species\ndiffers from P. gularis, by having a more developed nuchal crest,\nshorter limbs, larger and more heterogeneous dorsal body scales, and a\nshorter tail. P. phuwuanensis can be distinguished from P. gularis and\nthe new species by the presence of femoral pores and a distinct gular\nregion. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of P. gularis, P.\nphuwuanensis, the new species of Ptyctolaemus from Chin State, and other\nspecies in the draconine clade indicates that the P. phuwuanensis is\nsister to all other draconine agamids and we recommend the recognition\nof the genus name Mantheyus for P. phuwuanensis in light of these\nresults. Ptyctolaemus from Chin State and P. gularis are related but\nsignificantly different genetically and morphologically representing\nseparate species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ptyctolaemus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1775.phy"}]}
