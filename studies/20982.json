Multigene\nphylogeny based on nuclear ITS, ÃŸ-tubulin and HSP90 and mitochondrial\ncox1 and NADH1 gene sequences demonstrated that two species, P.\ntyrrhenica and P. vulcanica spp. nov., belong to phylogenetic Clade 7a,\nwhile the other two species, P. castanetorum and P. tubulina spp. nov.,\nclustered together with P. quercina forming a new clade, named here as\nClade 12. All four new species are homothallic and have low optimum and\nmaximum temperatures for growth and very slow growth rates at their\nrespective optimum temperature. They differed from each other and from\nrelated species by a unique combination of morphological characters,\ncardinal temperatures, and growth rates. Pathogenicity of all\nPhytophthora species to the root system of their respective host species\nwas demonstrated in soil infestation trials.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Clade7a_ITS ML
