The aim of this study was to prospect the\nMuscodor species producing antimicrobial volatiles, in tropical plants\nused in alternative medicine and coffee plants in Brazil. Eleven fungal\nisolates producing volatile metabolites was obtained and molecular\nphylogeny revealed the presence of at least three distinct species, M.\ncoffeanum, M. yucatanensis and Muscodor sp. SPME/GC/MS analyses of the\nmixture of volatiles emitted by Muscodor species obtained in this study\nrevealed the volatile profile and the presence of Cyclosativene as\ncompound with the highest percentage of peak per area to all isolates of\nMuscodor analyzed. All Muscodor isolates tested had some effect on the\ngrowth of Aspergillus species. Fifty-eight percent of the target species\nof Aspergillus died after six days exposure to volatiles emitted by M.\ncoffeanum CDA 741, in addition to the inhibition of growth in A.\nochraceus inoculated into coffee beans. A discovery of new Muscodor\nisolates, especially in different ecological niches with high activity\nof antagonism, is a promising source of biological control agent adapted\nto a particular environment that could be used on a specific site.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106793.phy"}]}
