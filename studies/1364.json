{"Authors":" Fredrik Pleijel, Jenny Persson","Year":" 2005","Title":" On the phylogenetic relationships of Axiokebuita, Travisia\nand Scalibregmatidae (Polychaeta)","Journal":" Zootaxa","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" We provide a description of newly collected specimens of\nAxiokebuita Pocklington & Fournier from Norway, previously known\nonly from east Canada and the Antarctic. Due to delineation problems\nbetween the only two described species, A. minuta (Hartman) and A.\nmillsi Pocklington & Fournier, these new specimens cannot\nunambiguously be referred to either species. Previously unnoticed\nadhesive papillae on the pygidium are present in both species and may\nconstitute an apomorphy for Axiokebuita. The taxon lacks many\nmorphological features otherwise characteristic for scalibregmatids, and\nto assess its affinities we present 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA-based analyses\ntogether with six other scalibregmatids and twenty other polychaetes. A\nnemertean is used as outgroup. All analyses support that Axiokebuita is\na scalibregmatid. Furthermore, Travisia Johnston, traditionally referred\nto the Opheliidae, is nested within the scalibregmatids, as sister to\nNeolipobranchius Hartman & Fauchald. Arenicolidae and Maldanidae may\nconstitute the sister group of scalibregmatids","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Axiokebuita, Travisia and Scalibregmatid\nPolychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4512.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B MP","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Axiokebuita, Travisia and Scalibregmatid\nPolychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4513.phy"}]}
