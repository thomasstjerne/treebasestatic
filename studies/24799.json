The ascomycete C. paspali is\nknown as the pathogen responsible for this disease in both grasses. This\nfungus produces alkaloids including ergot alkaloids and indole\nditerpenes which have potent neurotropic activities in mammals. A total\nof 32 isolates from Uruguay were obtained from infected P. dilatatum and\nP. plicatulum. Isolates were phylogenetically identified using partial\nsequences of the genes for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase\nsubunit II (RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), β-tubulin\n(TUB2) and the nuc rDNA 28S subunit (28S). Isolates were also genotyped\nby RAPD and presence of genes within the ergot alkaloid (EA) and\nindole-diterpene (IDT) biosynthetic gene clusters. This study represents\nthe first genetic characterization of several isolates of C. paspali.\nThe results from this study provide insight into the genotypic diversity\nof Claviceps paspali present in P. dilatatum and suggest that isolates\nfrom P. plicatulum could be considered an ecological subspecies or\nspecialized variant of C. paspali. Some of these isolates show\nhypothetical alkaloid genotypes never reported before.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RPB2 MP","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119008.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119009","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119009.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF MP","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119018","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119018.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119019","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119019.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S MP","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119022","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119022.phy"},{"tree_label":"TUB MP","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119020","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119020.phy"},{"tree_label":"TUB ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119021","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119021.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119023","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119023.phy"}]}
