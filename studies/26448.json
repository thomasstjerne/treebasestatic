In this\nstudy, we introduce a new genus Solomyces gen. nov. in the family\nThelebolaceae, which is supported by morphological observation and\nmultilocusbased [internal transcribed spacers (ITS) C LSU and ITS C LSUC\nMCM7C EF1AC RPB2] phylogenetic analysis. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian\nphylogenetic inference analyses indicated that Solomyces is a distinct\ngenus within this family. The new genus is compared against related\nThelebolaceae genera, and its description and illustration are provided.\nThis genus comprises one new species and one unnamed species (including\ntwo strains). We also report the addition of four new species \nPseudogymnoascus shaanxiensis, Pseudogymnoascus guizhouensis,\nPseudogymnoascus sinensis, and Geomyces obovatus  in the family\nThelebolaceae and present their morphological and phylogenetic\ncharacterizations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelebolaceae 52x2808","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129520.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelebolaceae 79x1220","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129521.phy"}]}
