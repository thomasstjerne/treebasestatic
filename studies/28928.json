Incorrect\nidentification will result in inaccurate biodiversity inventories that\nare an impediment to effective conservation management. Here, we present\ndata in which we argue that the generation of DNA barcode reference\nlibraries using DNA extracted from type specimens could resolve issues\nrelated to correct identification. The genus Micropholis (Sapotaceae) is\ndiverse and ecologically important in Neotropical lowland rain forests.\nWe first assessed the capacity of the molecular markers ITS2, matK and\nrbcL in differentiating species in the genus. Based on a phylogenetic\nreconstruction we found that many individuals in our study were\nincorrectly identified, and we argue that if we had access to a type\nspecimen DNA barcode reference library we would have more rapidly and\ncorrectly identified individuals.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134215","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134215.phy"}]}
