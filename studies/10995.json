Species in this clade form a conspicuous element of\ntropical forests worldwide and are important in horticulture, timber\nproduction, and pharmacology. To clarify phylogenetic uncertainty in the\ngroup, we conducted a multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the clusioids\nwith greatly improved taxon sampling compared to previous studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 1-2","ntax":"222","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clusioid Clade (Malpighiales), Expanded MajRule\nTree)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25569.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 3-4","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clusioid Clade (Malpighiales), Reduced MajRule\nTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25570.phy"}]}
