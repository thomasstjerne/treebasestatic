A gene encoding endo-rhamnogalacturonase (HIRHG), which\nbelongs to the glucose hydrolase family 28 (GH28), was found in a\nquantitative trait loci (QTL) region for virulence in Heterobasidion. In\nthis study, we showed that HIRHG was highly up-regulated during\ninfection of spruce bark compared with when grown in liquid culture and\nthat the protein was mainly produced during growth on complex carbon\nsources. Furthermore, our study of endo-rhamnogalacturonase revealed\nthat the gene had been lost in most of the biotrophic and hemibiotrophic\nplant pathogens investigated but was common in necrotrophic pathogens.\nExpression of the HIRHG gene in the hemibiotrophic fungus Magnaporthe\noryzae increased its capacity to grow on pectin; however, the\ntransformed M. oryzae isolates did not show a significant change in\nvirulence in our experimental set up.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92078.phy"}]}
