The causal organism, Phymatotrichopsis omnivora (=\nPhymatotrichum omnivorum), is known only as an asexual, holoanamorphic\n(mitosporic) fungus, and produces conidia resembling those of Botrytis.\nAlthough the corticoid basidiomycetes Phanerochaete omnivora\n(Polyporales) and Sistotrema brinkmannii (Cantharellales; both\nAgaricomycetes) have been suggested as teleomorphs of Phymatotrichopsis\nomnivora, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear small- and large-subunit\nribosomal DNA and subunit 2 of RNA polymerase II from multiple isolates\nindicate that it is neither a basidiomycete nor closely related to other\nspecies of Botrytis (Sclerotiniaceae, Leotiomycetes). Phymatotrichopsis\nomnivora is a member of the family Rhizinaceae, Pezizales (Ascomycota:\nPezizomycetes) allied to Psilopezia and Rhizina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3058.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3060.phy"}]}
