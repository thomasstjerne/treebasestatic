In this study\nwe record the discovery of Q. eucalypti causing leaf lesions on the\nnative to Uruguay tree, Myrceugenia glaucescens. The identity of the\npathogen was confirmed using DNA sequence comparisons of the ITS region.\nThis is the first record of the pathogen on a host other than\nEucalyptus. It clearly indicates a disturbing example of an alien\ninvasive pathogen having undergone a host-shift from non-native\nEucalyptus to a native tree in Uruguay.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP con tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Quambalaria eucalypti","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 NJ","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Quambalaria eucalypti","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5162.phy"}]}
