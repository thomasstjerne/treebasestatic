Three levels of sampling were employed: within an individual\n(a single spore), between individuals of a single soil sample, and\nbetween individuals of different soil samples across a 36 m2 area. High\nlevels of ITS sequence variation were discovered, and sequences from\ndifferent spores and different soil samples were sometimes more similar\nthan sequences of the same spore or soil sample. These results\ndemonstrate a complex pattern of rDNA organization within a natural\npopulation of Glomalean fungi, and challenge ideas of individuality and\ncollectivism in fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Semistrict of A. colossica 5.8S sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A. colossica type 1 sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3524.phy"}]}
