Genera previously included within the Buteoninae are Buteo,\nLeucopternis, Buteogallus, Harpyhaliaetus, Busarellus, Parabuteo,\nGeranoaetus, Geranospiza, Ictinia, Rostrhamus, Kaupifalco, and Butastur.\nWe analyzed representatives from all buteonine genera and most non-Buteo\n(i.e., 창\u001a\u001asub-buteo창\u001a\u001a) species with >3,000 bases of nuclear and\nmitochondrial DNA and found non-monophyly for the nominal genera Buteo,\nButeogallus, and Leucopternis. The Old World Lizard Buzzard (Kaupifalco\nmonogrammicus) is not closely related to buteonine taxa but is sister to\ngoshawks in the genera Melierax, Micronisus, and Urotriorchis. Another\nOld World genus, Butastur, is sister to the clade including all other\nbuteonine genera mentioned above. Investigation of several\n창\u001a\u001asuperspecies창\u001a\u001a complexes within the genus Leucopternis revealed\nnon-monophyly for the four subspecies of White Hawk (L. albicollis). On\nthe basis of mitochondrial data, L. a. albicollis forms a clade with L.\npolionotus, whereas L. a. costaricensis, L. a. ghiesbreghti, and L. a.\nwilliaminae form a clade with L. occidentalis. Among taxa included as\noutgroups, we found two species in the genus Circus to be clearly nested\nwithin a clade of Accipiter spp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML 500 bts","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a ML 500 bts","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a MB","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B ML 500 bts","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2997.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B MB","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buteoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2998.phy"}]}
