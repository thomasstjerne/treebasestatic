In this context, fungal enzymes can be used in the\nbioconversion of cellulose to glucose which can then be fermented to\nethanol. The aim of this work was to characterize LBM 033 strain and\nanalyze its efficiency in the hydrolysis of cellulosic substrates,\nincluding barley straw. LBM 033 strain was identified as Trametes\nvillosa by molecular techniques. The cell-free supernatant of T. villosa\nLBM 033 hydrolyzed pure cellulose to cellobiose and glucose and also\ndegraded the polysaccharides contained in barley straw to short soluble\noligosaccharides. These results indicate that macro fungi from tropical\nsoil environments, such as T. villosa LBM 033 can be a valuable resource\nfor in-house, cost effective production of enzymes that can be applied\nin the hydrolysis stage of lignocellulosic ethanol production.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trametes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121624.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trametes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121623.phy"}]}
