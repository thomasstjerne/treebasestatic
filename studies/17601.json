It plays a crucial\nrole in the stabilisation of the water-splitting Mn4CaO5 cluster, which\ncatalyses the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen by using light\nenergy. PsbO was also demonstrated to have a weak GTPase activity that\ncould be involved in regulation of D1 protein turnover. Our analysis of\npsbO sequences showed that many angiosperm species express two psbO\nparalogs, but the pairs of isoforms in one species were not orthologous\nto pairs of isoforms in distant species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Additional file 4","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus ML tree of psbO coding sequences","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87545.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus ML tree of psbO coding sequences","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87544.phy"}]}
