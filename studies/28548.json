Perenniporia subrhizomorpha is characterized by having\nan annual habit, resupinate and papery basidiomes, a dimitic hyphal\nsystem with crystallized generative hyphae in context, ellipsoid,\ntruncated, dextrinoid basidiospores (5.76.5 × 4.35.5 μm), and the\nabsence of cystidia and cystidioles. The morphologically similar species\nand phylogenetically closely-related species to the new species are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132213","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132213.phy"}]}
