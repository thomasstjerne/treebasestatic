Leucoagaricus brunneodiscus is distinguished by the presence\nof colourless to orange-white drops on the stipe, brownish-orange to\nbrown annulus with dark brown edge, ellipsoid basidiospores without a\ngerm pore, and small, clavate cheilocystidia. Detailed descriptions,\nfield photographs of the collected basidiomata, comparisons with\nmorphologically similar and phylogenetically related species and a\nphylogram generated from the combined dataset of nrITS and LSU sequences\nare provided. An artificial key to all Leucoagaricus taxa reported in\nIndia is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131984.phy"}]}
