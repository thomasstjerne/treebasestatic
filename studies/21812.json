Both species show unique morphological characters that\ndistinguish them from closely related species; Cryptodiscus muriformis,\ngrowing on decorticated or sometimes corticated branches of Picea abies\nand Pseudotsuga menziesii, resembles C. foveolaris and C. tabularum in\nthe yellowish-orange ascomatal disc, but is clearly distinguished by the\nmuriform ascospores. Schizoxylon gilenstamii grows on dead stems of\nGlobularia vulgaris and has a characteristic unique red-purple pigment\nin the epithecium and upper part of the excipulum that changes to\nbluish-green with KOH. We also report for the first time the anamorph of\nStictis brunnescens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107892.phy"}]}
