(INECOL) in Veracruz State. This new species is distinct\nbased on basidiome morphology and supported by phylogenetic analyses of\nsequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS and LSU regions. Fourteen\ndifferent collections obtained during 2012-2014, provided a wide\nmorphological variation and diagnostic color changes. Descriptions are\naccompanied by color images of the basidiomata, SEM photomicrographs of\nbasidiospores and comparisons with related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75736","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75736.phy"}]}
