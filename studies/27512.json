Phylogenies based on LSU and ITS sequence data were used to\ndetermine the relationship of the new taxon. Acrocordiella yunnanensis\nsp. nov. is introduced in this paper and is closely related to\nAcrocordiella omanensis in Requienellaceae. The novel taxon is\nillustrated and described, and a morphology-based key is provided to\nfacilitate identification of species of Acrocordiella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128298","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128298.phy"}]}
