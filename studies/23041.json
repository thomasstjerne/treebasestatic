It is\ncharacterized by annual, pileate, imbricated and sulphur yellow\nbasidiocarps, irregular hymenophore varying from poroid to hydnoid, a\nmonomitic hyphal structure in context but dimitic in the trama,\ngenerative hyphae bearing clam connections, indextrinoid skeletal\nhyphae, the absence of gloeocystidia, cystidia and gloeoplerous hyphae,\nthe presence of fusoid cystidioles, ellipsoid, thin-walled, finely\nasperulate, strongly amyloid and acyanophilous basidiospores measuring\n2.83.3 × 2.22.5 μm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the combined ITS\n(internal transcribed spacer region) and nLSU (the large nuclear\nribosomal RNA subunit) dataset demonstrated W. irregularis is a new\nlineage in Wrightoporiopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113020.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113019.phy"}]}
