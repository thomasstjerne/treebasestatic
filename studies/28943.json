The new species is characterized by sessile, gelatinous, light\nhoney-yellow to orange yellow, pulvinate to discoid, applanate,\nsometimes cerebriform basidioma, cylindrical to clavate probasidia\nmeasuring 40.060.0 × 4.09.0 µm, and hyaline, cylindrical or less\nreniform, 7-septate mature basidiospores measuring (17.0)18.023.5(24.0)\n× (5.9)6.38.0(8.4) μm. Phylogenetically, the new species forms a\ndistinct lineage closely related to D. stenosporus based on the ITS +\nnLSU dataset, but D. stenosporus has shorter probasidia (3040 × 4 μm)\nand smaller 3-septate mature basidiospores (1317 × 56 μm).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134264.phy"}]}
