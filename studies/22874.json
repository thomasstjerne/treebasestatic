Thirty-four\nisolates of Lasiodiplodia spp. were retrieved, which belong to twelve\ntaxa. Of which, eight species are new to science. Fungal identification\nwas conducted using a combination of morphology and multi-locus\nphylogenetic analyses based on combined translation elongation factor\n1-a sequence (tef1-a), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), ÃŸ-tubulin\n(TUB) and RNA polymerase II beta subunit (RPB2) nuDNA sequences. Cashew\nnut-shaped conidia and the baculate ornamentation on the conidia of\nLasiodiplodia spp. were first reported in this study. Aquilaria crassna\nproved a good host for Lasiodiplodia, and it is estimated that there\nwould be more new species of Lasiodiplodia in various substrates in\ntropical or subtropical area.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112201.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112202","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112202.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112203","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112203.phy"}]}
