We have addressed phylogenetic\nrelationships and presumed allopolyploid speciation by use of nuclear\n(NRPA2 and 5S-NTS) and chloroplast (matK, psbA-trnH, rps16, trnL,\ntrnL-F, and trnS-G) DNA sequence data. Nuclear and chloroplast data were\nincongruent, and nuclear data showed a better correlation with\nmorphology. Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic results show that: (1)\nLamium galeobdolon is sister to all remaining Lamium species; (2)\nWiedemannia is phylogenetically nested within Lamium; (3) L.\namplexicaule is polyphyletic; (4) most tetraploids have hybrid origins\nas suggested from the literature; (5) L. amplexicaule var. orientale is\nallotetraploid as well; and, (6) Mennemas (1989) infrageneric\nclassification is not corroborated by molecular data. Based on the\nmolecular results, and taking morphology into account, we suggest\nresurrection of the species L. aleppicum and L. paczoskianum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50% majority rule","ntax":"261","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamium 5S-NTS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31501.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50% majority rule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamium cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31502.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRPA2 Bayesian 50% MR","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamium NRPA2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31614.phy"}]}
