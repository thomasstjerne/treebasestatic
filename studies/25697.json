Partial rDNA sequences encompassing the internal\ntranscribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS), RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit (RPB2), translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha (TEF1), and\nβ-tubulin (TUB2) genes were obtained from the four endophytic Fusarium\nisolates. Mating type (MAT) loci PCR were used to assess the\nreproductive mode of these fungi. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses based\non RPB2, TEF1, and TUB2 sequences demonstrated that the endophytic\nisolates belong to two species clearly distinct from all known taxa in\nF. fujikuroi and F. lateritium species complexes. These isolates are\nheterothallic (self-sterile) with only the HMG domains present. Based in\nmorphological characters and molecular phylogenetic analyses, are being\nproposed Fusarium atlanticum and Fusarium massalimae as novel\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121606.phy"}]}
