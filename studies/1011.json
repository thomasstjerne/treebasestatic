Teleomorphs are reported\nfor Trichoderma minutisporum (Hypocrea minutispora sp. nov.) and T.\npolysporum (H. pachybasioides). Hypocrea pilulifera/T. piluliferum is\nredescribed. Trichoderma croceum is synonymized with T. polysporum. The\nnew species H. parapilulifera, H. stellata, and H. lacuwombatensis are\ndescribed. All of these species fall within the morphological concept of\nTrichoderma sect. Pachybasium and within the phylogenetic group\n‘pachybasium B5’ of Kullnig-Gradinger et al (2002). Parsimony analysis\nof nucleotide sequences from three unlinked loci ñ ITS1 and 2,\nendochitinase (ech42) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) -\ndetects two distinct phylogenetic lineages within the group “pachybasium\nB5,’ one comprising H. pachybasioides/T. polysporum, H. pilulifera/T.\npiluliferum, H. parapilulifera and H. stellata. This group is\ncharacterized by having conidia that are white in mass and is the only\nlineage within Hypocrea characterized by such conidia. The second group\nincludes the green conidial T. minutisporum and H. lacuwombatensis. The\npartition homogeneity test reveals significant recombination within\nformer, ìwhite-conidiaî species, but not within the ìminutisporumî\nlineage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea/Trichoderma species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4151.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr4150","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4150.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr4152","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4152.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr4153","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4153.phy"}]}
