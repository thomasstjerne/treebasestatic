It is,\nhowever, unclear to what extent natural selection shapes LDD. In a\nphylogenetic comparative study, we test whether species facing frequent\ncatastrophic population extinction have increased LDD.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"291","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protea, Leucadendron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113900.phy"}]}
