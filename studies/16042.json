The\nabundance and wide distribution of modern and disarticulated fossil\nOphiuroidea [2], including brittle-stars and basket stars, makes them an\nideal model system for global marine biogeography if we had the\nphylogenetic framework necessary to link extant and fossil morphology in\nan evolutionary context. Here we construct a phylogeny from a highly\ncomplete 425 gene 61 taxa transcriptome-based dataset covering 15 of the\n18 ophiuroid families and representatives of all extant echinoderm\nclasses. We calibrate our phylogeny with a series of novel fossil\ndiscoveries from the early Mesozoic. We confirm the traditional\npaleontological view that ophiuroids are sister to the asteroids and\ndate the crown-group Ophiuroidea to the mid Permian (270±30 mya). We\nrefute all historical classification schemes of the Ophiuroidea based on\ngross structural characters but find strong congruence with schemes\nbased on lateral arm plate microstructure [3, 4] and the temporal\nappearance of various plate morphologies in the fossil record. The\nverification that these microfossils contain phylogenetically\ninformative characters unlocks their potential to advance our\nunderstanding of marine biogeographical processes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"partitioned AA RAxML","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ohara ophiuroid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76302.phy"}]}
