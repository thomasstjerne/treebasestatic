The aim of work presented here was to explore the\ndiversity of blue-stain fungi and assess the influence of the felling\nmethod and storage time/sampling period on their abundance and species\ndiversity. Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) grown in Poland were cut in\nApril and July 2016, and fungal isolations from 20 stained logs that\nwere obtained by mechanized harvesting and chainsaw harvesting, were\ncarried out 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after felling. In total, eight fungal\ntaxa were identified, including seven known and one novel species. Among\nthe blue-staining fungi detected, seven taxa belonged to\nOphiostomatales, and one was identified as Sphaeropsis sapinea. The most\nfrequently isolated fungi were S. sapinea, Ophiostoma minus and\nOphiostoma ips. Additionally, Graphilbum acuminatum, Leptographium\nsosnaicola sp. nov., O. floccosum, O. piliferum and Sporothrix\neucastaneae were found. More fungal isolates were obtained from\nsummer-harvested logs than spring-harvested logs and from\nchainsaw-harvested logs than mechanically harvested logs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Leptographium spp. LSU","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122607","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122607.phy"},{"tree_label":"Leptographium_spp_TUB_tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122717","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122717.phy"},{"tree_label":"Leptographium_spp_TEF1_tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122718","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122718.phy"}]}
