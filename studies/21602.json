We aimed to estimate the number, age and\norigins of endemic grass lineages in the Madagascar region, and to\ncompare the diversification of C3 and C4 taxa. Location Madagascar and\nthe surrounding Indian Ocean islands, integrated within a global\ndataset. Methods We estimated 11 time-calibrated molecular phylogenies\nincluding 73% of Madagascar’s known grass flora (65% of endemics), using\ntwo calibration scenarios. Integrating the available sequences from\nworldwide grass species, a total of 1928 accessions were analysed. We\ntested range evolution models, estimated ancestral ranges, and compared\nthe patterns of lineage accumulation between endemic C3 and C4 grasses.\nResults We recovered 69 lineages endemic to or with an estimated origin\nin the Madagascar region, 25 of them C3 and 44 C4. Range evolution\nanalysis suggests widespread distance-scaling of dispersal and strongest\nhistorical links to Africa. Extant grass diversity largely accumulated\nsince the Miocene, with parallel increases in C3 and C4 taxa. Two large\nC3 groups in the “Forest shade clade” (Paniceae: Boivinellinae) and the\nbamboos (subtribe Hickeliinae) have an estimated origin in the\nMadagascar region. Divergences and crown ages of endemic C4 lineages\nlargely coincide with the Miocene grassland expansion. Main conclusions\nMadagascar’s extant grass flora is the result of multiple overseas\ndispersals, predominantly from Africa, and diversified from the Miocene\nonwards. C3 grasses are characterised by two large presumed in situ\nradiations of shade grasses in the Paniceae and bamboos. Endemic C4\nlineages result from twice as many immigration events, resulting in\nsmaller clades. Ages of C4 lineages are consistent with a Pliocene or\nLate Miocene origin of grasslands in Madagascar, but estimating the\nnature and expanse of such early grasslands will require further\nresearch.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107158.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bambusoideae younger 28Ma","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poeae older 32Ma","ntax":"392","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aristidoideae younger 32Ma","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aristidideae older 41Ma","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107171.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brachypodieae older 43Ma","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107167","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poeae younger 26Ma","ntax":"392","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bambusoideae older 34Ma","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107165.phy"},{"tree_label":"ArundinoideaeMicrairoideae younger 38Ma","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107180.phy"},{"tree_label":"ArundinoideaeMicrairoideae older 47Ma","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107181.phy"},{"tree_label":"Panicoideae younger 38Ma","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107172","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107172.phy"},{"tree_label":"Panicoideae older 48Ma","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107173","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107173.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chloridoideae older 49Ma","ntax":"373","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107183.phy"},{"tree_label":"Danthonioideae younger 29Ma","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Danthonioideae older 38Ma","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brachypodieae younger 34Ma","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107166","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paniceae younger 25Ma","ntax":"516","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107174","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107174.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paniceae older 30Ma","ntax":"516","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107175","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107175.phy"},{"tree_label":"AndropogoneaeArundinelleae younger 11Ma","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107176","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107176.phy"},{"tree_label":"AndropogoneaeArundinelleae older 14Ma","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107177.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chloridoideae younger 38Ma","ntax":"373","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107182.phy"}]}
