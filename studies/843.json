The fungus\nhas a bright yellow capitate ascigerous head, a white, ridged stalk, and\na well-developed membrane covering the whole ascoma. The asci,\nascospores, and paraphyses are similar to those of Cudonia and\nSpathularia. Based on morphology and DNA sequence analysis, a new\nspecies, Cudonia sichuanensis, is reported. Cudonia and Spathularia are\nclosely related to members of Rhytismataceae, as has been suggested\npreviously. The similarity of ascoma and ascospore development between\nthese two genera and Lophodermium (Rhytismataceae) is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"new Cudonia species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5668.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"new Cudonia species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5669.phy"}]}
