Parsimony analyses included two aproaches: a) a\nmultiple-sequence alignment where gaps were treated as missing or coded,\nb) using direct sequences by direct optimization as implemented by POY.\nAnalyses under direct optimization were conducted using the molecular\ndatasets independently and combined, and with morphological data.\nDifferent cost regimes were explored and that producing the highest\ncongruence between partitions was chosen. Among the genera considered,\nonly Piptochaetium, Austrostipa, and He! sperostipa were resolved as\nmonophyletic, while Achnatherum, Amelichloa s.l., Anatherostipa, Jarava,\nand Nassella were polyphyletic, and Aciachne was polyphyletic or\nparaphyletic. As a result, Amelichloa can be restricted to a\nmonophyletic group if including A. brachychaeta, A. ambigua, A.\nclandestina, and A. caudata, or it should be considered within Nassella.\nThe phylogenetic position of species of Aciachne suggests inbreeding and\noutbreeding events with species of Anatherostipa, Ortachne and\nHesperostipa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 2 rpoA trees","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rpoA tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7283.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 trnT-L tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnT-L tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 rpl16 tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rpl16 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7282.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 trnL-F tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnL-F tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5 combined 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined DNA+morpho 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5 combined 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined DNA+morpho 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7287.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5 combined 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined DNA+morpho 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7288.phy"}]}
