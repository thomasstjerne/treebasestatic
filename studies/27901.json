We estimate the phylogeny for Clitellata as a whole, using a\ntaxon sample adhering to current definition of Haplotaxidae and\nincluding species attributable to Haplotaxis, plus a representation of\nother clitellates. Sequences of five markers, in total 4087 bp, were\nanalysed by Bayesian Inference. A well-supported tree shows that\nHaplotaxidae is polyphyletic, consisting of at least five separate\nclades scattered among other clitellate lineages. We redefine\nHaplotaxidae s. str. to only include Haplotaxis, and describe\nPelodrilidae Martinsson et al. fam. n. for Pelodrilus, Hologynus, and\nDelaya, and Haplotaxoididae Martinsson et al. fam. n. for Haplotaxoides\nFend gen. n. (with H. decipens Fend sp. n. and H. tehama Fend sp. n.).\nFurther, we describe Kurenkovia setoensis Fend & Torii sp. n. and\nOhtakiana kakidaensis Fend & Torii gen. et sp. n., both currently\nconsidered incertae sedis. Haplotaxidae and Pelodrilidae seem to belong\nto an incompletely resolved group also including lumbriculids, leeches\nand earthworms. Moreover, a close relationship between Kurenkovia,\nOhtakiana and the lumbriculid-hirudinean clade (i.e., taxon\nLumbriculata) is strongly supported, whereas Haplotaxoididae seems to\nhave its roots among the somewhat older, paraphyletic assemblage of\n“microdrile” families.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129491.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129490.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129492.phy"}]}
