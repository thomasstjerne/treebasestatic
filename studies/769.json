Partial LSU rRNA gene sequences of 19\nascomycetes were determined and aligned with the corresponding sequences\nof 13 other ascomycetes retrieved from Genbank, including all classes\ntraditionally distinguished and most of the recently accepted classes.\nThe classification based on SSU rDNA data and morphological characters\nis supported, while the traditional classification and classifications\nbased on the ascus-type are rejected. Ascomycetes with perithecia and\ncleistothecia form monophyletic groups, while the discomycetes are a\nparaphyletic assemblage. The Pezizales are basal to all other\nfilamentous ascomycetes. The monophyly of Loculoascomycetes is\nuncertain. The results of the LSU rDNA analysis agree with those of the\nSSU rDNA and RPB2 gene analyses, suggesting that most classes\ncircumscribed in the filamentous ascomycetes are monophyletic. The\nbranching order and relationships among these classes, however, cannot\nbe elucidated with any of these data sets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"filamentous ascomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3847.phy"}]}
