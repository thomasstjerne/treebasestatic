Several genera such\nas Micraira and Eriachne were considered incertae sedis in the most\nrecent subfamilial classification of the grasses, but these two genera\nformed a well supported clade in an analysis based on chloroplast and\nstructural data. Another genus, Isachne, traditionally classified in the\nPanicoideae, also formed part of this well supported clade. Despite\nstrong molecular support for the clade, thus far no morphological\nsynapomorphy has been found. Nevertheless, the strongly supported\nmonophyly of this clade allowed us to suggest the recognition of a new\nsubfamily within the PACCAD clade. Since there was already a name\navailable, in this paper we propose the reinstatement and emendation of\nthe circumscription of Micrairoideae. The reinstatement of Micrairoideae\nchanges the acronym PACCAD to PACCMAD for this large clade of\ngrasses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Micrairoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2555.phy"}]}
