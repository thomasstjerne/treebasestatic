The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been\nconsidered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in\nTaxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia.\nSubsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in\nseveral other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants\nand endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in\npaclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the\nquestion about whether the origin of this pathway in these two\nphysically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal\ngene transfer.The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium\naurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was\nestablished by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton\nnuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum\nNRRL 62431, was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in\npaclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known\npaclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel\nbiosynthetic gene candidates in P.aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have\nevolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer is an unlikely\nevent.Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic\nfungi synthesize paclitaxel,and will facilitate metabolic engineering\nfor the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69423","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69424","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69440.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69441","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69441.phy"}]}
