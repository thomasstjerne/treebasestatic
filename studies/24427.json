One of these\nspecies complexes is the complex around Lactifluus deceptivus, or the\ndeceptive milkcaps. These species are macroscopically characterized by\nlarge white velutinous basidiocarps and an acrid taste. In this paper, a\nthorough molecular study of this complex is performed. Even though most\ncollections were identified as L. deceptivus, the clade is shown to\ncontain at least 16 species, distributed across Asia and America. Two\nnew Neotropical species are described: Lactifluus hallingii and\nLactifluus domingensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactifluus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactifluus ML ITS rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120524.phy"}]}
