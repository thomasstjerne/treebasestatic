Skinnera, the only Old World group in the\ngenus, comprises three species in New Zealand and one in Tahiti. These\nspecies include a tree, a large shrub, a climbing-scandent shrub, and a\ncreeping, barely woody plant. The section is extremely distinct from the\nNew World species of Fuchsia, and several sharply contrasting models\ndepicting the evolutionary history of these species and the character\nstate changes associated with habit, breeding systems, and chemistry\nhave been proposed. A chloroplast DNA restriction site analysis of sect\nSkinnera and two outgroup sections was performed, generating a single\ntree depicting maternal relationships. This tree is congruent with one\npreviously proposed model and demonstrates that the rare F. procumbens\nof New Zealand is the sister group to all other species in the section,\nwhile F. cyrtandroides of Tahiti is the sister taxon of the two\nremaining New Zealand species. Based on the chloroplast DNA analysis, a\ncritical reevaluation was made of character state changes in the section\nrelating to morphology, breeding systems, and flavonoid compounds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuschia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1561.phy"}]}
