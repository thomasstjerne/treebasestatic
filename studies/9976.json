The present\npaper describes the application of molecular and physiological tools to\ninvestigate the possible existence of cryptic species within T.\nboudieri. The markers used include sequences taken from the 5’ end of\nthe ribosomal large subunit gene, a chitin synthase partial sequence,\nβ-tubulin partial sequence and amplified fragment length polymorphism\n(AFLP)-based markers. The markers divided the isolates into three\ngroups, each correlated to an ITS type. Over 100 fruit bodies, among\nwhich each ITS type was represented in at least 30 specimens, were\ntested with each of the markers. Three of the physiological traits\nexamined: initial growth, mycelial proliferation and mycorrhiza\nformation, consistently showed responses paralleling ITS type; the\nresults presented support the division of T. boudieri into three cryptic\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Terfezia boudieri isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6473.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Terfezia boudieri isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6638.phy"}]}
