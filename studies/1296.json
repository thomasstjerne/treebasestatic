Wu, Z.H. Yu, Y.C. Dai & C.H. Su\nis proposed as a new genus of lignicolous polypore, and Ganoderma\ncomphoratum M. Zang & C.H. Su is designated as its generic type. New\ncombinations for two species of Taiwanfungus are presented: T.\ncamphoratus (M. Zang & C.H. Su) Sheng H. Wu, Z.H. Yu, Y.C. Dai &\nC.H. Su, and T. salmoneus (T.T. Chang & W.N. Chou) Sheng H. Wu, Z.H.\nYu, Y.C. Dai & C.H. Su. Taiwanfungus camphoratus is known in Taiwan\nas “niu-chang-chih”. Morphological features of this new genus mostly\nresemble Antrodia and Antrodiella among polypore genera. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on sequence data derived from LSU rDNA indicates that\nTaiwanfungus camphoratus neither close to Antrodia, nor to Antrodiella.\nTaiwanfungus camphoratus is endemic to Taiwan, and known only occur on\ntrunk of Cinnamomum kanehirai Hay. This fungus species is well known by\nits medicinal uses and high economic value. Taiwanfungus camphoratus was\nfirst named Ganoderma comphoratum in 1990. Antrodia cinnamomea T.T.\nChang & W.N. Chou was presented for the same species in 1995.\nAntrodia camphorata (Zang & Su) Sheng H. Wu, Ryvarden & T.T.\nChang, new combination proposed in 1977 based on Ganoderma comphoratum,\nhas then been widely adopted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taiwanfungus camphoratus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4441.phy"}]}
