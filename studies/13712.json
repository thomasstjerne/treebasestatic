Network analyses were applied to resolve conflicting signals\namong data sets and putative scenarios of reticulate evolution. All\nanalyses of all regions consistently revealed two major clades, which\nare formalized as subtribes: A) Traubiinae, formed by Traubia, Placea,\nPhycella, Rhodolirium, and Famatina maulensis, characterized by x = 8,\nrare polyploidy, and a capitate stigma, and B) Hippeastrinae, including\nEithea, Habranthus, Haylockia, Hippeastrum, Rhodophiala, Sprekelia,\nZephyranthes, and Famatina pro parte, characterized by a range of basic\nchromosome numbers (x = 6  11) and frequent polyploidy and aneuploidy.\nNo clear morphological features diagnose the latter clade, which\ncontains ca. 90% of the tribes species diversity. Our phylogenetic\nresults question the monophyly of all genera in the tribe and show\nwidespread cytonuclear discordance within the mainly Neotropical\nHippeastrinae, further supporting putative ancient hybridization(s)\npreceding the radiation of this major clade. In contrast, the\nChilean-Argentinean endemic Traubiinae shows a tree-like pattern of\nevolution, consistent with the apparent absence of allopolyploidy in\nthis clade. A brief description, circumscription, and geographic\ndistribution are provided for each subtribe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"[1]Tree1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63193","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63193.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
