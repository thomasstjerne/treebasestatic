Angiosperm phylogeny is the foundation\nof studies of gene function and phenotypic evolution, divergence time\nestimation and biogeography. The relationship of the five divergent\ngroups of the Mesangiospermae (~ 99.95% of extant angiosperms) remains\nuncertain, with multiple hypotheses reported in the literature. Here,\ntranscriptome datasets are obtained from 26 species lacking sequenced\ngenomes, representing each of the five groups, eudicots, monocots,\nmagnoliids, Chloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae. Phylogenetic analyses\nusing 59 carefully identify low-copy nuclear genes resulted in highly\nsupported relationships: sisterhood of eudicots and a clade containing\nChloranthaceae and Ceratophyllaceae, with magnoliids being the next\nsister group, finally followed by monocots. Our topology allows a\nreexamination of the evolutionary patterns of 110 morphological\ncharacters; the molecular clock estimates of Mesangiospermae\ndiversification during the late to middle Jurassic corresponded well to\nthe origins of some insects, which may have been a factor facilitating\nearly angiosperm radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesangiospermae 59 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76697.phy"}]}
