With the increasing availability of molecular\nsequence data, there is a renewed interest in historical biogeography,\nespecially in groups where species boundaries have consequently changed\ndramatically, such as lichenized fungi. In the hyperdiverse family\nParmeliaceae, the genera Parmelina and Myelochroa have contrasting\ncentres of distribution, with Myelochroa being most diverse in eastern\nAsia and Parmelina in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. We used\nmulti-locus sequence data from 53 specimens to understand the impact of\nhistorical events on the current distribution patterns in these genera.\nWe reconstructed phylogenetic relationships, estimated divergence times,\nand inferred ancestral distributions. Our analyses suggested that the\nancestor of the two genera occurred in the Old World and that these\ngenera split during the Eocene. Diversification in both genera was\nestimated to have occurred during the Miocene, with ancestor of\nMyelochroa likely occurring in Asia, whereas the ancestor of Parmelina\nlikely occurred in the Turanian region and Europe or only Europe. The\ntwo Parmelina species occurring in the New World (P. coleae, P.\nyalungana) are not closely related and migrated independently from the\nOld World.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102064.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myelochroa_Parmelina 5 genes trees","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102058.phy"}]}
