Of these, Weberbauera\nspathulifolia has the largest geographic range in the genus that extends\nca. 3000 km along the Andean highlands from La Rioja Province in\nArgentina to the Ancash Department in Peru. This species also exhibits\nthe greatest morphological variation in the genus. However, whether this\ngeographical and morphological variation represents one or more lineages\nremains unclear. In this study we analyze W. spathulifolia across its\nentire distribution range using molecular, morphological, and ecological\ndata. Because there is no phylogenetic analysis for the genus, we\ngenerated a comprehensive molecular sampling using nuclear (ITS) and\nplastid (trnL-F and trnH-psbA) sequences for other species of\nWeberbauera and some South American Thelypodieae. Results obtained from\ndifferent data and analyses support the presence of two different\nlineages within W. spathulifolia, one inhabiting the northern portion of\nthe species range, and the other distributed along its southern and\ncentral geographic range. Therefore, we propose here to retain the\nnorthern lineage under W. spathulifolia and to treat the\nsouthern-central lineage under W. orophila, comb. nov. Results of this\nstudy should contribute to understanding the biodiversity of the Andean\nBrassicaceae","trees":[{"tree_label":"trnH MrBayes con50","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118694","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118694.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnH RAxML BestTree","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118695.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS RAxML Best Tree","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118698.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF MrBayes con50","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118696","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118696.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MrBayes con50","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118692.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF RAxML BestTree","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118699.phy"}]}
