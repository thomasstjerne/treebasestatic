This fungus is characterized by\nstipitate, branched and multi-headed basidiocarps with fascicled\nmarginal hyphae on the sterile parts of the basidiocarps and narrow\ncylindrical to navicular basidiospores. No dacrymycetous species with\nthese morphological characteristics has been reported. Based on\nphylogenetic analysis of 28S rDNA sequences, the new specimens belong\ninto the Dacrymycetaceae lineage. As an appropriate genus cannot be\ninferred fromthe phylogeny, we describe this fungus as a new species,\nCalocera arborea, based on its morphological characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clutea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63635.phy"}]}
