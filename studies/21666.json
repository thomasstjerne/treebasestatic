Opiliaceae have remained taxonomically unresolved and the\ngeneric relationships within the family have been disputed. Here we\nconducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of the family and its close\nrelatives using a combined data set of the nuclear ribosomal (SSU rDNA\nand LSU rDNA) and the chloroplast rbcL, matK and trnL-F regions. We also\ncarried out a morphological phylogenetic analysis using 24 characters\nfor all the species of Opiliaceae and three species in Santalaceae s.l.\nand Strombosiaceae as outgroups. Molecular analyses strongly supported\nthe monophyly of Opiliaceae. Agonandra is sister to all the other genera\nof Opiliaceae. The remaining genera form two major clades: the Opilia\nclade (including Cansjera, Lepionurus, Opilia, Pentarhopalopilia,\nRhopalopilia and Urobotrya), and the other consisting of Anthobolus plus\nthe Champereia clade (including Champereia, Melientha and Yunnanopilia).\nThe Chinese endemic genus Yunnanopilia is supported as a distinct genus.\nWe propose a new classification of Opiliaceae, recognizing 12 genera and\nfour tribes, with the description of a new tribe, Champereieae Bing Liu,\nC.T.Le, L.M.Lu & Z.D.Chen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Opiliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110215.phy"}]}
