Bayesian and maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of a\nconcatenated plastid data set recovered well-resolved trees that are\ntopologically similar, with many clades supported by unique indels. MP\nand Bayesian analyses of the ITS sequence data recovered trees that have\nseveral well-supported topological differences, both among analyses, and\nto trees inferred from the plastid data. The most substantial of these\nconcerns A. vulneraria and A. lemanniana, whose placement in the\nparsimony analysis of the ITS data appears to be due to a strong\nlong-branch effect. Analysis of the secondary structure of the ITS1\nspacer showed a strong bias towards transitions in A. vulneraria and A.\nlemanniana, many of which were also characteristic of certain outgroup\ntaxa. This may contribute to the incorrect placement of this clade in\nthe MP tree for the ITS data. Additional conflicts between the plastid\nand ITS trees were more taxonomically focused. These differences may\nreflect the occurrence of reticulate evolution between closely related\nspecies, including a possible hybrid origin for A. hystrix (a species\nendemic to the Balearic Islands). The patterns of incongruence between\nthe plastid and the ITS data seem to correlate with taxon ranks. All of\nour phylogenetic analyses supported the monophyly of Anthyllis\n(incl.Â Hymenocarpos). Although they are often taxonomically associated\nwith Anthyllis, the genera Dorycnopsis and Tripodion are shown here to\nbe more closely related to other genera of Loteae. We infer up to six\nmajor clades in Anthyllis that are morphologically well-characterized,\nand which could be recognized as sections. Four of these agree with\nvarious morphology-based classifications, while the other two are novel.\nWe reconstruct the evolution of several morphological characteristics\nfound only in Anthyllis or tribe Loteae. Some of these characters\nsupport major clades, while others show evidence of homoplasy within\nAnthyllis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47506.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47507.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47508.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP tre","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47534","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47534.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47509.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47510.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_Anthyllis_ITS.tree","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47531","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47531.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47511.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47512.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47513.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47514.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47515.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47516.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47517.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47518.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47519.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47520.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47521.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47522.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47523.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47524.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47525.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47526.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47527.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47528","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47528.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47529","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47529.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47530","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47530.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47532","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47532.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes.tree","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47533.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes.tree","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47535","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47535.phy"}]}
