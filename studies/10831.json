We propose six new species of Terfezia which have been assigned\nto six clades: Clade I as T. extremadurensis, Clade II as T. eliocrocae,\nClade III as T. lusitanica, Clade IV as T. pini, Clade V as T.\npseudoleptoderma and Clade VII as T. albida. Moreover, we have\nassociated the already described species T. fanfani and T. olbiensis\nwith Clades VI and VIII, respectively. These results obtained are\nsupported by the morphological features of the Terfezia sporocarps\nstudied, which were identified macroscopically and microscopically,\ntheir ecological patterns and chorological characteristics, as well as\nby the phylogenetic analyses presented herein. The morphological\nfeatures and the compared genomic ITS-rDNA sequences of the identified\nspecimens belonging to the Terfezia genus are also described. A short\nkey is presented to identify the studied Terfezia species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr21487","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21487.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr24831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_24831.phy"}]}
