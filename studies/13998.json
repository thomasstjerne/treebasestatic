The collection site was west of the\nGreat Dividing Range in a young, dry sclerophyll woodland forest\ndominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris north of Coonabarabran in an area\nknown as the Pilliga Scrub. Although the Pilliga Scrub is characterized\nby frequent and often large, intense wildfires, the site showed no sign\nof recent fire, which suggests this species is not a post-fire morel.\nCaps of the Morchella elata-like morel were brown with blackish ridges\nsupported by a pubescent stipe that became brown at maturity. Because no\nmorel has been described as native to Australia, the collections were\nsubjected to multilocus molecular phylogenetic and morphological\nanalyses to assess its identity. Results of these analyses indicated our\ncollection, together with previous collections from NSW and Victoria,\nrepresented a novel, genealogically exclusive lineage, which is\ndescribed and illustrated here as Morchella australiana Elliott et\nal. sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Morchella elata Subclade","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella australiana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61889.phy"}]}
