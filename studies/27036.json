Most species in this order are\nmorphologically similar, possessing monocentric, eucarpic, spherical\nthalli. Here, based on analysis of 18S and 28S rDNA, we add the new\ngenus and species Polyrhizophydium stewartii to the order. This saprobe\nof moribund aquatic plant leaves is the first known rhizomycelial\nspecies in the order. In our molecular phylogeny P. stewartii groups\nwith the amphibian pathogens Batrachochytriuim dendrobatidis and B.\nsalamandrivorans, making it of particular interest to investigators\nstudying evolutionary pathways associated with host-switching and\nmorphological adaptation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127757","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127757.phy"}]}
