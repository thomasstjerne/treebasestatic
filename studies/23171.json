Botryosphaeriacous fungi\nassociated with blueberry have been widely documented (Kong et al. 2010,\nYu et al. 2012, 2013a, 2013b, Xu et al. 2015, Xu 2016, Wang et al. 2016,\nDou et al. 2017). So far, three species of Botryosphaeria have been\nreported from blueberries (Vaccinium spp.), namely L. chinensis Z. P.\nDou, Y. Zhang ter., L. pseudotheobromae A.J.L. Phillips, A. Alves &\nCrous and L. theobromae (Pat.) Griffon & Maubl. (Xu et al. 2015,\nWang et al. 2016, Dou et al. 2017). In the course of an ongoing survey\nof blueberry diseases in China, two new taxa with general\ncharacteristics of Lasiodiplodia were collected. Combined ITS, tef1-α,\nTUB and RPB2 DNA sequences comparisons also verified its new status\nwithin Lasiodiplodia. Based on the combination of morphological and\nmolecular differences, two new species, L. henanica and B.\nparaphysoides, are introduced. Their pathogenicities are also determined\nby Koch’s postulates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113267.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
