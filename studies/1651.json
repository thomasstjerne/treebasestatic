Caninae (Rosa canina, R.\ncorymbifera and R. rubiginosa) in Germany. Two Phragmidium species (P.\nmucronatum and P. tuberculatum). were found and were able to infect each\nof the three dogrose species, although the overall infection of R.\nrubiginosa was significantly lower which could be important for rose\nbreeding. Despite their overlapping host ranges, the phylogenetic\nbackground of P. tuberculatum and P. mucronatum was found to be quite\ndistinct. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that P. mucronatum shares a\ncommon ancestor with other rose rusts, whereas P. tuberculatum evolved\nfrom a Rubus-Sanguisorba rust clade and must have undergone to Rosa\nspp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phragmidium on Dog Rose","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2577.phy"}]}
