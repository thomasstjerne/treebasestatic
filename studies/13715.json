Molecular phylogeny of the published\ndata revealed, however, inconsistencies in species concepts and taxonomy\nof Tulasnella challenging understanding of specificity, ecology and\nbiogeography of the symbiotic taxa. The nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, in\nparticular the highly variable internal transcribed spacer region\nincluding 5.8S (nrITS-5.8S), are the most widely used genes for\nphylogenetic studies in fungi. However, the variability in the\nnrITS-5.8S region is exceptionally high among Tulasnella sequences\nprovoking difficulties in the interpretation of the phylogenetic signal\nderived from this gene. The aim of the present study was to clarify the\nhigh variability in the nrITS-5.8S sequences of Tulasnella in order to\nimprove understanding of the phylogeny and definition of operational\ntaxonomic units. We analyzed the complete nrITS-5.8S and partial 28S\nribosomal RNA genes from an extensive data set of Tulasnella including\nnew sequences from tropical orchids. We found eight subsets as\nmeaningful assemblages characterized by distinct sequence polymorphisms\nof the nrITS-5.8S region. Size differences in ITS1 and ITS2 among\nsubsets were significant. However, the phylogenetic signal from both ITS\nregions was not constant across the subsets. We recommend the use of\n5.8S-ITS2 region to improve interpretation of the high variability in\nthe nrITS-5.8S sequences of Tulasnella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59366.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59367.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59372.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59369.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59371.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59368.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59370.phy"}]}
