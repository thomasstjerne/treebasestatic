The T. solium genome and the\npredicted proteome were reported recently, providing a wealth of\ninformation from which new interventional targets might be identified.\nParasitologists have long focused their investigation on proteases, not\nonly for the fundamental biochemical aspects of these enzymes but also\nbecause proteases represent potentially targetable checkpoints in the\npathogensâ physiology. In order to characterize and classify the entire\nrepertoire of protease-encoding genes of T. solium, we analyzed the\npredicted proteins of this cestode through a combination of\nbioinformatics tools. Functional annotation was performed to yield\ninsights into the signaling processes relevant to the complex\ndevelopmental cycle of this tapeworm and to highlight a suite of the\nproteases as potential intervention targets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree inferred from amino acid sequences of\nselected S1 family proteases","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74432.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inferred phylogenetic relationships C1 family\nproteases","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74413.phy"}]}
