Recent expeditions to Hengduan Mountains\nin China found an interesting liverwort with flask-shaped involucres\nclearly belonging to Sphaerocarpos, the second largest genus of\nSphaerocarpales with nine species. The SEM observations and phylogenetic\nanalyses based on DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal 26S and two plastid\nregions (rbcL and psbA) indicate that the Chinese plant represents a new\nspecies described as Sphaerocarpos siguniangensis R.L.Zhu et You\nL.Xiang, sp. nov. Our results also reveal that Sphaerocarpos texanus\nAustin known from Africa, America, Europe and Oceania is not\nmonophyletic, suggesting that broader sampling and further analyses of\nits related species are needed to arrive at a proper understanding of\nthis interesting genus. A new subgenus known only from U.S.A.,\nSphaerocarpos subg. Criscarpos, is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaerocarpales rbcL psbA-trnH 26S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120965.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaerocarpales rbcL psbA-trnH 26S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120964.phy"}]}
