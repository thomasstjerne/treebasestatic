In order to address the evolution of Begonia we have produced\nmaximum parsimony cladograms for nuclear large subunit and internal\ntranscribed spacer sequence data in combination with 34 informative\nmorphological characters. Data were obtained from 64 species of Begonia,\nthe monotypic genus Hillebrandia, and both species of Datisca. The\nresulting phylogenetic hypotheses supported three main clades within\nBegonia, two internally resolved clades of African plants, and one\nunresolved transcontinental clade containing species from southern\nAfrica, America, Asia, and the Socotran archipelago. Morphological\ncharacters often support well-resolved molecular clades. Tepal number in\nthe staminate and carpellate flowers and fruit characters are discussed.\nNone of the morphological characters sampled, including traditionally\nemphasized characters in sectional delimitations such as locule number\nand number of placental branches, provides a basis for subdividing\nBegonia into easily circumscribed monophyletic groups. Implications for\nfuture sectional classifications of Begonia are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Begoniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Molecular","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Begoniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2038.phy"}]}
