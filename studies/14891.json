However, to date the systematic positions of seven Asian\ngenera, Cosmostigma, Graphistemma, Holostemma, Pentasachme, Raphistemma,\nSeshagiria, and Treutlera have not been investigated. In this study, we\nexamine evolutionary relationships among these seven small enigmatic\nAsian genera and clarify their positions in the known phylogeny of\nAsclepiadoideae, using a combination of plastid sequences of rbcL,\nrps16, trnL and trnL-F regions. Cosmostigma and Treutlera are resolved\nas members of the non-Hoya clade of Marsdenieae (maximum parsimony\nbootstrap support value BSMP = 96, maximum likelihood bootstrap support\nvalue BSML = 98, Bayesian-inferred posterior probability PP = 1.0),\nPentasachme as sister of Stapeliinae in Ceropegieae (BSMP = 64, BSML =\n66, PP = 0.94). Graphistemma, Holostemma, Raphistemma, and Seshagiria\nall belong to the Asclepiadeae-Cynanchinae (BSMP = 97, BSML = 100, PP =\n1.0). The study confirms the generally accepted tribal and subtribal\nstructure of the subfamily. One exception is Eustegia minuta, which is\nhere placed as sister to all Asclepiadeae (BSMP = 58, BSML = 76, PP =\n0.99) and not as sister to (Marsdenieae+Ceropegieae). The low support\nand conflicting position indicate the need for a placement of the genus\nas an independent tribe. In Asclepiadeae, a sister group position of\nCynanchinae to (Asclepiadinae+Tylophorinae) is favored (BSMP = 57, BSML\n= 74, PP = 0.99), while Schizostephanus is retrieved as unresolved.\nOxystelma takes a position at the base of Asclepiadinae (BSMP = 52, BSML\n= 74, PP = 0.69). Calciphila and Solenostemma are associated with\nAsclepiadinae with low support (BSMP = 37, BSML = 45, PP = 0.79), but\nall alternative positions are essentially without support. The position\nof Indian Asclepiadoideae in the family phylogeny is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best tree","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Ascleps, RAxML best tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67788.phy"}]}
