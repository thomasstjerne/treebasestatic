We examined the suitability of organic\nacid production as an effective taxonomic character for reclassification\nof the species. Strains were divided into two groups, LA (lactic acid\nproducer) and FMA (fumaric-malic acid producers) according to organic\nacid production. These grouping were confirmed as phylogenetically\ndistinct, because analyses of rDNA ITS, lactate dehydrogenase B, actin,\ntranslation elongation factor-1∞¿, and genome-wide AFLP resolved the\nsame two exclusive clusters, corresponding with the organic acid\ngrouping. Reclassification of strains in the FMA group as R. delemar was\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus delemar, EF-1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2878.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus delemar, AFLP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2879.phy"},{"tree_label":"FIg. 2a","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus delemar, ldhB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4907.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus delemar, act 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4908.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus delemar, rDNA ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4909.phy"}]}
