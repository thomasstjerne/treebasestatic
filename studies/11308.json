A phylogeny based on three\ngenes (LSU, rpb2, tef1-Î±) reveals that O. ailaoshanense belongs to the\nGnomoniaceae (Diaporthales, Ascomycetes) and forms a distinct branch\ndistinct from the currently known genera. Occultocarpon ailaoshanense is\ncharacterized by perithecia with thin, central to eccentric necks in\ngroups embedded in a stroma, and oblong elliptical-elongated,\none-septate ascospores. Occultocarpon ailaoshanense occurs on the bark\nof branches of Alnus nepalensis (Betulaceae) in Yunnan, China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31298","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31298.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31299.phy"}]}
