Morphology of this fungus was studied and DNA\nsequence analyses of large subunit (LSU) and small subunit (SSU)\nribosomal DNA, the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (TEF-1Î±)\nand the RNA polymerase II gene (RPB2) were used to determine the\nphylogeny of this fungus. Helicascus mangrovei possesses semi-immersed\nlenticular ascomata and stromata-like structures covered with a\ncarbonaceous, dark-brown to black pseudoclypeus. Its ascomata do not\nhave a separate locule. The bitunicate ascus is pedunculate with an\nocular chamber and pseudoparaphyses. Ascospores are hyaline when was\nimmature, particular, mature are dark brown/ obovoid shaped, 1-septate,\nuniseriate, unequally two celled, thick-walled, with larger brownish\napical cells and smaller basal cells (smooth, slightly constricted at\nthe septum, one apiculate end). Helicascus mangrovei forms a\nwell-supported clade within Helicascus species and is closely related to\nmarine species within the Morosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales. Based on the\nmorphological features and molecular data, a new marine species of\nHelicascus is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98824.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98823.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98825.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98822","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98822.phy"}]}
