UGPMA cluster\nanalysis of similarity matrices (Nei genetic identity, I) generated from\ndata of 267 electrophoretic forms (electromorphs) of 15 enzymes showed a\nclose correspondence between electrophoretic similarity and morphology.\nIsolates of a species had high similarity and clustered at I \u001a 0.60, and\nin cases where different taxa clustered at I > 0.60, an examination\nof the morphology and history of the isolates suggested conspecificity.\nIsozyme characterization was also useful for identifying the extent of\nmorphologic variation within versus between species and for comparing\nisolates with degenerate morphology after prolonged culture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptographium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1430.phy"}]}
