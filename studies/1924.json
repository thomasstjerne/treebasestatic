Poor character definition, an ineffective\ndiagnosis of the genus, and inadequate or poor descriptions and\nillustrations have resulted in difficulties in identification of species\nor generic membership. This study is based on type material or the\nliterature, and encompasses 28 species. Four new genera are created,\njustified by a phylogenetic analysis of 26 ingroup taxa and a further 12\noutgroup taxa. Four species of the ingroup were excluded owing to\nmissing data. Four species are retained in Haplomesus sensu stricto; two\nspecies are removed to Cornuamesus, gen. nov; 10 species are removed to\nFortimesus gen. nov. and 12 species are removed to Gracilimesus, gen.\nnov. One species, Haplomesus franklinae Merrin & Poore, 2003 is\nremoved from the group and placed in Contrarimesus, gen. nov. with\nanother species, Ischnomesus curtispinis Brandt, 1992. The species level\nis conferred on Haplomesus insignis orientalis. Haplomesus\nquadrispinosus sensu Brandt, (1992) is removed from H. quadrispinosus\n(Sars, 1879). and Haplomesus ?gorbunovi sensu Svavarsson, (1984) removed\nfrom Gracilimesus gorbunovi (Gurjanova).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haplomesus, Unweighted Strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2895.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haplomesus, All Analyses Strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2896.phy"}]}
