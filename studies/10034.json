Based on light microscopic examinations, the\nflagellates were then classified into the two genera Devescovina and\nMetadevescovina. Here, we combined molecular phylogenetic analysis of\nthe small subunit rRNA genes of the gut flagellates with the first\nultrastructural investigation of the genus Metadevescovina. Our results\nsuggest that I. marginipennis contains only one species of devescovinid\nflagellates, Metadevescovina modica, which comprises three variants of\nthe same phylotype (=99.5% sequence similarity). Monophyly of all\nMetadevescovina sequences obtained from Pterotermes and Incisitermes\nspecies in this and previous studies and the absence of filamentous\nbacterial epibionts typical of Devescovina species (M. modica is densely\ncolonized with spirochetes) corroborate the validity of the genus\nMetadevescovina and allow its differentiation from other genera of\ndevescovinid flagellates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Devescovinid flagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6071.phy"}]}
