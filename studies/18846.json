Oncocyclus species generally occur in small\npopulations or locally scattered over rocky hillsides, steppes, and\ndeserts from the north Caucasus to the eastern Mediterranean. Species of\nthis section are easily recognized by their inflorescences of a single,\nlarge, spherical flower and sepals with a dark signal spot and adjacent\nbeard of multicellular hairs. We present here results of the first\nphylogenetic study of sect. Oncocyclus based on one low-copy nuclear and\nsix plastid markers from 33 of approximately 42 species and\ninfraspecific taxa. Gene trees are congruent and nuclear markers are\nmore potentially parsimony informative than plastid markers. We identify\nclades that do not correspond to previously described species groups\nbased on size, color, and shape of perianth parts and show that\nhypotheses of species monophyly are not supported. In general,\ndiversification is greatest along terminal branches suggesting that\nspecies diversified in isolation. The Caucasus is suggested as the\nancestral area for sect. Oncocyclus and the eastern Mediterranean as an\nimportant area of diversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iris spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93746.phy"}]}
