Recent multi-gene studies of this generic complex indicated\nthat the genus Ilyonectria is paraphyletic. The present study was\ntherefore initiated to re-evaluate the generic status of Ilyonectria and\nat the same time address some taxonomic irregularities in the genera\nCylindrodendrum and Neonectria. Using multi-gene DNA data and\nmorphological comparisons, the genus Dactylonectria is introduced with\n10 new combinations, several of which were previously treated in\nIlyonectria. Two new species, D. hordeicola and D. pinicola, are also\ndescribed. Furthermore, one new combination is provided in the genus\nCylindrodendrum, and three new combinations in the genus Neonectria, for\nspecies previously treated in the genera Acremonium, Cylindrocarpon,\nNectria and Neonectria. The aquatic genus, Heliscus, is also reduced to\nsynonymy under Neonectria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectriaceae Combined alignment of ITS, LSU, tub2 and\ntef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79658.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectriaceae Combined alignment of ITS, LSU, tub2 and\ntef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79657.phy"}]}
