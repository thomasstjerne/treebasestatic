Our results\nindicate that a fourth, hitherto unknown main phylogenetic lineage\noccurs in Iberia, so that in total, the species is divided into six\ndistinct clades, including T. m. mauritanicus, T. m. simplex and four\nas-yet unnamed lineages that appear to be endemic to Iberia. Percentages\nof sequence divergence among the main clades in T. mauritanicus reach\nthe range reported for recognized species in other notostracan lineages.\nA thorough morphological investigation also revealed that the\ndifferentiation among these lineages is higher than previously thought\nand that populations of three of the main clades within T. mauritanicus\ncan be reliably separated from each other and from the remaining\nlineages based on morphology of adult males. The remaining clades also\nshow a significant level of morphological differentiation, but include a\ncertain proportion of populations for which the additional application\nof molecular methods is needed for a reliable determination. The\ngeographic distributions of 12S haplotypes are indicative of frequent\ndispersal events and gene flow among populations belonging to the same\nmain lineage, but gave no evidence of recent migration events among\ndifferent main lineages, suggesting that there is no gene flow among the\nlatter. Our data thus suggest that the six main lineages within T.\nmauritanicus represent distinct species. We therefore describe the\nIberian lineages as new species, T. baeticus n. sp., T. gadensis n. sp.,\nT. vicentinus n. sp. and T. emeritensis n. sp. and reinstate T. simplex\nto full species status. Our data confirm the general, previously\nrecognized pattern of a lower dispersal probability in gonochoric Triops\ntaxa. However, we found evidence that passive dispersal in Triops may be\nfurther complicated by a strong habitat-dependence of dispersal\nprobability, mediated by prevailing dispersal vectors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure_2b","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7228","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7228.phy"},{"tree_label":"second ML tree PAUP","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7229","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure_2c","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7230.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_MP_PAUP","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7234","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7234.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure_2a","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7232","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7232.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_tree_COI_gene","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7236","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7236.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_ML_PAUP","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7233","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7233.phy"}]}
