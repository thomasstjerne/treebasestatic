Levipedes is published. Taxonomic status of all seven\nspecies (G. alpinus, G. aquosus, G. dryophilus â including var. lanipes,\nG. erythropus, G. fagiphilus, G. hybridus, and G. ocior) belonging to\nthis subsection, based on anatomic-morphological characters, is\nconfirmed by DNA sequences of ITS and translation elongation factor\n1-alpha genes. We elucidate the concepts of G. dryophilus and G. ocior,\nwhich were sometimes confused in older literature. Due to unavailability\nof previously selected neotype of G. dryophilus the respective neotype\nspecimen is selected. Gymnopus dryophilus var. lanipes is confirmed as a\ntaxon on a rank of variety, no important differences from nominotypical\nvariability were detected. All discriminative characters used for\nidentification of these species are discussed in detail. An\nidentification key is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopus subsect.
