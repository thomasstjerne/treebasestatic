A new species of\nMicrodochium was identified as the causal agent of leaf blight, a novel\ndisease of this plant. In 2010, foliar necrosis and canopy thinning were\nobserved on 11 surveyed golf courses in Hainan Province, China,\nespecially on fairways and putting greens. The infected leaves initially\nappeared to be water-soaked and dark green, but then leaves rapidly\nfaded to yellow or became chlorotic. The infected leaves rapidly died,\nleading to a sparse appearance in infected areas, leading to the disease\nname âsparse leaf patchâ. Isolates with rich and light pink to yellow\nmycelia and salmon-coloured pionnotes were cultured from diseased turf\nfoliage. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating these isolates onto\nâSeasprayâ seashore paspalum. Phylogenetic analysis based on internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1Î± (tef-1Î±)\nand Î²-tubulin (BenA) sequence data indicated these isolates formed as a\ndistinct clade within Microdochium (Xylariales). Further microscopic\nexamination demonstrated that the species was morphologically distinct\nfrom three similar species of Microdochium. The name Microdochium\npaspali sp. nov. is proposed for this novel fungal pathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML phylogenetic tree for Microdochium spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77046.phy"}]}
