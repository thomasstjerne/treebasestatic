In\nmost well understood cases of HGT, acquired and donor functions appear\nto remain closely related. Thus, the degree to which HGT can lead to\nevolutionary novelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity\nthrough the sedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we\nidentify the crystal matrix protein, OCTIN. Phylogenetic analysis\nstrongly supports acquisition of octin by HGT from bacteria. A bacterial\nOCTIN forms high-order periplasmic oligomers, and inter-molecular\ndisulphide bonds are formed by both fungal and bacterial OCTINs,\nsuggesting that they share elements of a conserved assembly mechanism.\nHowever, estimated sedimentation velocities preclude a gravity sensing\nfunction for the bacterial structures. Together, out data suggest that\nHGT into the Mucorales allowed a dramatic increase in assembly scale and\nemergence of the gravity sensing function. We conclude that HGT can lead\nto evolutionary novelties that emerge depending on the physiological and\ncellular context of protein assembly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacterial OCTIN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110779.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacterial OCTIN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110780.phy"}]}
