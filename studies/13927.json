We show\nthat standard Bayes factor tests of the monophyly of a group, or the\nplacement of a sample sequence in a known reference tree, can be\nmisleading. The reason for this is related to the well-known dependency\nof Bayes factors on model-specific priors. Specifically, when testing\ntree hypotheses it is important that each hypothesis is associated with\nan appropriate tree space in the prior. This can be achieved by using\nappropriately constrained searches or by filtering trees in the\nposterior sample, but in a more elaborate way than typically\nimplemented. If it is difficult to find the appropriate tree sets to be\ncontrasted, then the posterior model odds may be more informative than\nthe Bayes factor. We illustrate the recommended techniques using an\nempirical test case addressing the issue of whether two genera of diving\nbeetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Suphrodytes and Hydroporus, should be\nsynonymized. Our refined Bayes factor tests, in contrast to standard\nanalyses, show that there is strong support for Suphrodytes nesting\ninside Hydroporus, and the genera are therefore synonymized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diving Beetles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60967.phy"}]}
