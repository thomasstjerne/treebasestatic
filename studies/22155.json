Brasiliomyces\nmalachrae, a type species, is distributed in Central and South America\nand the morphology of this species, especially its asexual morph, is\npoorly known. This study was performed to describe the sexual and\nasexual morphs of B. malachrae on M. coromandelianum in detail, and to\nclarify the phylogenetic placement of this fungus. The asexual morph of\nthis species is characterized by having hyaline ectophytic mycelium with\nlobed hyphal appressoria and catenescent conidia. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses based on 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA gene sequences revealed that\nB. malachrae is a sister to the genus Erysiphe and situated at the\nboundary between tribes Golovinomyceteae and Erysipheae, which supports\nits unique phylogenetic position. The evolutionary relationships among\nthe tribes Golovinomyceteae, Erysipheae, and Phyllactinieae are\ndiscussed on the basis of the present phylogenetic analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brasiliomyces 18S+5.8S+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117161.phy"}]}
