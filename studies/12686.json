However,\nthe relationships among the remaining genera remained unresolved.\nCyphostemma, Tetrastigma, and Vitis were clearly monophyletic, while\nboth Ampelopsis and Cayratia were paraphyletic and Cissus was\npolyphyletic. Parsimony based studies of character evolution suggested\nthat 5-merous flowers, leaf-opposed inflorescences, and a hermaphroditic\nsexuality are ancestral character states in the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vitaceae","tree_kind":"Species
