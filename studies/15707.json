Phomopsis) spp. are well known saprobes,\nendophytes or pathogens on a range of plants. Several species have wide\nhost ranges and multiple species can sometimes be found colonising the\nsame host. This study describes nine novel Diaporthe spp. isolated from\nlive and/or dead tissue of the broad acre crops sunflower, soybean,\nmungbean, lupin and maize, and associated weed species, as well as the\nenvironmental weed bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp.\nrotundata) in eastern Australia. The new taxa are differentiated on the\nbasis of morphology and DNA sequence analyses based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer region, and part of the translation elongation factor\n1α and ß-tubulin genes. The possible agronomic significance of weed\nresidues as ‘green’ and ‘brown bridges’ in aiding survival of the newly\ndescribed Diaporthe spp. is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe spp. in Australia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74489.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe spp. in Australia ITS+TEF+BT select ref root\n+ sunflower NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74495.phy"}]}
