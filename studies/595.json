A cladistic\nanalysis of rogadine and exothecine genera, coupled with an optimization\napproach to estimating ancestral character states, is used to analyze\nthe evolution of various aspects of endoparasitism within this\nassemblage. At least two independent origins of endoparasitism are\nhypothesized - one in the Rogadini and the other in an assmeblage\nincluding the Gnaptodontinae, Opiinae and Alysiinae. Phylogenetic\nanalyes and hypotheses can be useful not only in interpreting\nevolutionary trends, but in guiding and providing insights into more\ngeneral comparative behavioural and physiological studies of\nparasitism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rogadinae/Exothecinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3546.phy"}]}
