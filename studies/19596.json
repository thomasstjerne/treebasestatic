Free radicals carry an\nunpaired electron and is extremely reactive and capable of engaging a\nrapid chain reaction that destabilizes other molecules. Hence, natural\nantioxidants have gained momentum among consumers and researchers\nbecause, its frequent intake reduces the cause of damage to the organs\nby free radicals. Cancer is currently accountable for 25% of all deaths\nin the developed world. In this study, a total of 55 fungal strains were\nisolated from terrestrial soil samples. Chosen fungal strains were\nselected for the extraction of secondary metabolite and phytochemical\nanalysis. The antioxidant and anticancer potentials of three fungal\nstrains DMTMGK004, DMTMGK008 and DMTMGK010 were analysed. Further\nanalysis were made on the partial ITS region of the strains and\nphylogenetic trees were constructed. The findings of the study showed\nthat ethyl acetate extracts of Aspergillus terreus strains DMTMGK004,\nDMTMGK008 and Talaromyces marneffei DMTMGK010 have demonstrated\nanti-proliferative action against AGS gastric cancer cells.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97363","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97363.phy"}]}
