Phylogenetic analyses of\nnuclear large ribosomal subunit sequence data confirm placement of the\nnovel taxon within Pseudobaeospora, and suggest a close relationship of\nthis genus with Tricholoma. A comprehensive description, color\nphotograph, illustrations of salient micromorphological features, and\ncomparisons with phenetically similar taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"199","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60353.phy"}]}
