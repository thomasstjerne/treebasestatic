Our Maximum Likelihood\nand Bayesian analyses coding indel information, show that T. rutilans is\nactually a species complex. Specimens of T. rutilans s.l. form 4\nlineages, all of them characterized by having red-purple tones on the\nstipe, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose spores and narrow pleurocystidia\n4-7 Âµm broad. One of those lineages is described as the new species T.\npteridicola, collected in the Western Pyrenees, featured by its slender\nfruitbodies, pale yellowish cream lamellae and association with\nPteridium aquilinum. We identify the lineage that comprises most\nspecimens as T. rutilans s. str. and we propose a lectotype accompanied\nby an epitype to stabilize the use of the name. Tricholomopsis rutilans\nvar. splendidissima is reduced to synonymy with T. rutilans based on\nmorphological examination and the ITS sequence of the type specimen. The\nother two lineages, referred to as T. aff. rutilans 1 and T. aff.\nrutilans 2, are at present morphologically not distinguishable with\ncertainty from T. rutilans, and we conclude that further morphological\nand molecular studies are needed in order to formally describe\nthem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholomopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80101.phy"}]}
