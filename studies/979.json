The\nisolates showed a unique combination of sporangial and gametangial\ncharacters, and could not be assigned to any known species of the genus.\nThe isolates are characterised by a relatively low growth rate,\ninternally proliferating sporangia and extremely variable, monoclinous,\nsessile or shortly stalked antheridia. Direct germination of sporangia\nfrequently occurs in liquid culture. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregions of the ribosomal DNA show very low levels of similarity to those\nof all known species of Pythium. This paper describes the isolates as\nPythium montanum sp. nov., gives details on its morphology and provides\npreliminary information on its pathogenicity. Additional molecular\nevidence for its status as a new species is also provided. Phylogenetic\nanalyses with a set of Pythium spp. show that P. montanum groups in a\nclade together with P. vexans, a species whose taxonomical status still\nremains unclear, and that is considered a ëborder species’ between\nPythium and Phytophthora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"its1-tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5787.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5786.phy"}]}
