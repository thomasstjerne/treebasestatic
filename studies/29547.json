Phylogenies on Spongipellis are reconstructed with multiple loci\nDNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS),\nthe large subunit (nLSU) and the small subunit (nSSU) of nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene and the translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene\n(TEF1). The results demonstrate the polyphyly of Spongipellis, including\ntwo genera belong to different families, Pseudospongipellis gen. nov. is\nestablished including three new combinations. Three new species,\nIrpiciporus sinuosus, Radulodon yunnanensis and Spongipellis quercicola\nspp. nov., are described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136075.phy"}]}
