Phylogenetic analyses using the nuclear\nsequences ITS1, SSU, LSU, TEF, RPB1, and RPB2 also confirmed the\ndistinctiveness of this new species. Fungal epizootics were found on\nfemale soft scale insects, which may have important implications for\ninclusion and establishment of biological control parameters in the\nforestry program of the city. The ecology of the fungus as well as its\npotential use as a biological control agent are further discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86806.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86807.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86809.phy"}]}
