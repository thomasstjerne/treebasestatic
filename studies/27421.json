P.\nKumm. and belonging to Tricholoma sect. Genuina is known as one of\ncommon poisonous mushrooms in Japan. Kakishimeji contains the toxic\ncompound, ustalic acid, and causes digestive troubles. However, this\nfungus is consumed in some local regions in Japan without any digestive\ntroubles. In this study, we aimed to clarify the probable\nspecies-complex of “Kakishimeji”, based on the phylogenetic analysis. We\ncollected 79 basidioma specimens of “Kakishimeji” and related species\nfrom various forest sites in Japan, and conducted multi-gene\nphylogenetic analyses. As a result, “Kakishimeji” consisted of four\ndistinct phylogenetic clades based on any DNA regions tested. Of these,\ntwo clades were included in the known species, i.e. T. stans and T.\nalbobrunneum, respectively. Another two clades consisted sister clades\nto known species, i.e. T. pessundatum and T. ustaloides, respectively.\nIn addition, all four phylogenetic clades of Kakishimeji showed\ndifference in their spore and basidium size, respectively. Therefore, we\nregarded the latter two clades as two new Tricholoma species, i.e. T.\nkakishimeji and T. kakishimejioides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS_bayes_tree","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127934.phy"}]}
