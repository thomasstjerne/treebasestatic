However,only 24 findings have been reported so\nfar in the literature and probably only a dozen specimens still exist in\nzoological collections.By calling for new data among scholars and\npotential occasional recorders, we documented 19 new findings of the\nspecies, which confirm that populations are present today in four\ndisjunct areas, in the southern Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia, the\nsouthern Italian peninsula and Sicily. A phylogenetic analysis of the\nfirst molecular data obtained for Plutonium(16S, COI, 18S, 28S) provided\nstrong evidence that it is closely related to Theatops, either sister to\nthe latter or nested within it, with an estimated separation since the\nMesozoic. Additionally, the direct examination of specimens from all the\nfour inhabited areas allowed us to document many synapomorphies uniting\nPlutonium and Theatops, including brownorange body colour, whitish\npatches in the place of wanting ocelli, a peculiar denticulation on the\nforcipules, and the conspicuously swollen and piercing ultimate legs. We\nalso highlighted some derived characters unique to Plutonium, including\nthe bladeedged claws of the ultimate legs and the previously\noverlooked presence of long, dense setae on most other legs, both in\nmales and females from throughout the range.","trees":[{"tree_label":"16S MP","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plutonium 16S Maximum Parsimony","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91706.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_MP_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_Maximum_Parsimony_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91709.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_MP_tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_Maximum_Parsimony_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91708.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_ML_tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_Maximum_Likelihood_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91713.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_ML_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_Maximum_Likelihood_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91711.phy"},{"tree_label":"Time_tree_Plu_nested","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Divergence_time_estimation_tree_Plutonium_nested_with_Theatops","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91716.phy"},{"tree_label":"StarBeast_BI_tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"StarBeast_Bayesian_Inference_tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91718.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_BI_tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_Bayesian_Inference_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91723.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S_MP_tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_Maximum_Parsimony_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91707.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_BI_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_Bayesian_Inference_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91722.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S_BI_tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_Bayesian_Inference_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91721.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S_ML_tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_Maximum_Likelihood_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91712.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated_MP_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Concatenated_Maximum_Parsimony_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91719.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated_ML_tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Concatenated_Maximum_Likelihood_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91715.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_ML_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_Maximum_Likelihood_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91714.phy"},{"tree_label":"Time_tree_Plu_basal","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Divergence time estimation tree Plutonium basal","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91717.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_BI_tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_Bayesian_Inference_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91720.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91740","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91740.phy"}]}
