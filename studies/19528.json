These conidial structures are similar to those of\nthe genus Pestaloia. The genus Synnemapestaloides is classified in the\nfamily Amphisphaeriaceae solely according to its conidial structure.\nHere we demonstrate that Synnemapestaloides represents a distinct genus\nin the family Discosiaceae (Amphisphaeriales) according to the\nnucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer and ÔÅ¢-tubulin.\nThe genus and species most closely related to Synnemapestaloides are\nSeimatosporium and Seim. foliicola, respectively. We conclude therefore\nthat Seim. foliicola should be classified as a paraphyletic genus. These\nresults demonstrate that asexual morphs of Discosiaceae have pycnidial\nor, acervular conidiomata or synnematal conidiomata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100830","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100830.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100831.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100832.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides rhododendri ITS BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97653.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97650.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides rhododendri ITS BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97651.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides rhododendri ITS BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97652.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97648.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synnemapestaloides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97649.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100827","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100827.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100828","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100828.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100829","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100829.phy"}]}
