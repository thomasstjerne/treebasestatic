It differs from the other two species\nof the genus by the paleaceous trichomes on young stems and petioles,\nand by the strongly bullate/foveolate leaves. A phylogenetic analysis\nwith all three species, based on rbcL and ndhF dna sequence data, showed\nthat Physeterostemon forms a monophyletic group, sister to Eriocnema\nfulva, and this clade is placed in a polytomy at the base of the tribe\nMiconieae sensu stricto. However, there is no resolution within\nPhyseterostemon, thus the phylogenetic relationships of the three\nspecies cannot be established.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melastomataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5986.phy"}]}
