Hybridization\nis common in the subgenus when two or more species occur in sympatry. We\nexamined evolutionary trends and the importance of hybridization to the\nevolution in the subgenus. Phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns among\nmembers of Penstemon subgenus Dasanthera were assessed using nuclear\nribosomal ITS and chloroplast matK sequence data, and inter-simple\nsequence repeat (ISSR) markers. These data support previous hypotheses\nsuggesting that the Cascade-Sierra Nevada lineage is derived from the\nnorthern Rocky Mountain lineage. Furthermore, there is a shift in growth\nform from suffructescent perennials to evergreen subshrubs concurrent\nwith migration to the Cascade-Sierra Nevada mountains. Within the\nCascade-Sierra lineage, P. newberryi and P. rupicola exhibit floral\ncharacters that may represent adaptations for hummingbird pollination.\nThe ISSR data demonstrate the utility of dominant markers for\nreconstructing phylogenetic relationships at the interspecific\nlevel.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; 0.25 interval; ordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; Cascade/Sierra Nevada\nspecies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4110.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6d","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; 0.10 interval, unordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6f","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; Thiele coding, unordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6c","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; any instance coding","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4116.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6e","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; 0.10 interval, ordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6g","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dasanthera ISSR data; Thiele coding, ordered","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4119.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS; Penstemon subg.
