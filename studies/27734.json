A.\nglobospora sp. nov. is characterized by globose sporangiospores, a low\nprojection on columellae and sympodial sporangiophores. A. turgida sp.\nnov. is characterized by variable sporangiospores, up to 9.5 µm in\nlength projection on columellae and occasionally swollen hyphae. A.\nzonata sp. nov. is characterized by cylindrical to oval sporangiospores,\na 23.5 µm in length spinous projection on columellae and as many as 8 in\na whorl sporangiophores. A. medulla sp. nov. is characterized by\ncylindrical to oval sporangiospores, 14.5 µm in length projection on\ncolumellae and skeleton-like rhizoids. Sequences of ITS and nLSU gene\nregions of the studied strains were generated. The phylogenetic analysis\nbased on molecular data of ITS and D1-D2 domains of nLSU sequences\nsupported the novelty of these four species within the Absidia.\nFurthermore, a identification key was supported to the known species of\nAbsidia in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131150.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131151.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131153.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131152.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131154.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131155.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131156.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131159","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131159.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131160","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131160.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 11","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131162.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 12","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131163.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 13","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 14","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131165.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 15","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131166","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 16","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131167","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 18","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 19","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 20","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131171.phy"}]}
