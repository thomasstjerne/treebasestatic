One-third of\nthe tubers of sweetpotato were infected in the field. These tubers in\nthe field with bacterial inner brown displayed yellowing on the skin\nthat turned into slightly roughened and cracked surface with progress in\ndisease. Cross-sections of these roots revealed a yellowish brown or\ndark brown circle in the vascular cambium. Pathogenicity tests were\nconducted on different organs of two sweetpotato cultivars and revealed\nthat the isolated bacteria are pathogenic on stems and roots. We\nconfirmed the causal agent as Burkholderia gladioli based on biochemical\nand physiological characterization, carbon source utilization, and\nsequence analysis of partial 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region. To our knowledge, it is the first\nreport on the occurrence of B. gladioli in sweetpotato as a\npathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121286","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121287","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121287.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121288","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121288.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121289.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121290","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121290.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121291","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121291.phy"}]}
