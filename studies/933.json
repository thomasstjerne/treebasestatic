ITS and\nlarge subunit rDNA were sequenced and compared to determine the\nphylogenetic position of this species. It is most closely related to\nPenicillium adametzii. Penicillium brocae has only been found in\nassociation with the coffee berry borer and is one of several fungi that\ngrow in coffee berry borer galleries. Penicillium brocae may provide the\nexogenous sterols necessary for the coffee berry borer’s development and\nthus be mutualistically associated with the insect.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_820.phy"}]}
