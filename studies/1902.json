We propose desirable\nproperties that a supertree should satisfy in this framework, namely the\nnon-contradiction property (PC) and the induction property (PI). The\nformer requires that the supertree does not contain relationships that\ncontradict one or a combination of the source topologies, whereas the\nlatter requires that all topological information contained in the\nsupertree is present in a source tree or collectively induced by several\nsource trees. We provide simple examples to illustrate their relevance\nand that allow a comparison with previously advocated properties. We\nshow that these properties can be checked in polynomial time for any\ngiven rooted supertree. Moreover,we introduce the PhySIC method\n(PHYlogenetic Signal with Induction and non-Contradiction). For k input\ntrees spanning a set of n taxa, this method produces a supertree that\nsatisfies the above-mentioned properties in O(kn3 + n4) polynomial\ncomputing time. The polytomies of the produced supertree are also tagged\nby labels indicating areas of conflict as well as those with\ninsufficient overlap. As a whole, PhySIC enables the user to quickly\nsummarize consensual information of a set of trees and localize groups\nof taxa for which the data requires consolidation. Lastly, we illustrate\nthe behaviour of PhySIC on primate datasets of various sizes, and\npropose a supertree covering 95% of all primate extant genera.
