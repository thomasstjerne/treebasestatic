We\nillustrate the synnematal stage and lateral, solitary conidiophores of\nP. putredinis obtained in vitro on MEA. We also provide ITS, LSU, SSU,\nand tef sequence data for P. putredinis which are deposited in\nGenBank.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111986","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111986.phy"}]}
