The novel\ntaxon, Yuxiensis, is distinctly characterised by immersed to erumpent,\nsemi-globose ascomata, which are not surrounded by any tomentum or\nconspicuous subiculum, a subcylindrical quellkörper in the centrum,\nclavate asci with long pedicels and al-lantoid hyaline ascospores with\ngranular contents. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probability\nanalyses based on LSU, ITS, tef1 and rpb2 sequence data depict a close\nphylogenetic relationship of the new genus to Pseudocatenomycopsis,\nhence, confirming its placement in Scor-techiniaceae.\nParasympodiellaceae, thus far belonging to Parasympodiellales, is\ntransferred to Coro-nophorales based on multi-gene phylogenetic\nevidence. Additionally, the incertae sedis monotypic genus\nArthrocristula is treated as a synonym of Parasympodiella, with\nArthrocristula hyphenata re-combined as Parasympodiella hyphenata comb.\nnov., as the ex-type strain of Arthrocristula hyphenata clusters inside\nthe Parasympodiellaceae clade along with other Parasympodiella\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133075.phy"}]}
