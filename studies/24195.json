Foc infects\nPhoenix canariensis and has a worldwide presence, whereas Fop primarily\ninfects Washingtonia robusta and Syagrus romanzoffiana and is currently\nrestricted to Florida (USA). A PCR based screening was used to detect\nand compare the Secreted in Xylem (SIX) gene profile among Fop (33) and\nFoc (32) isolates obtained in the USA. SIX1, SIX7, SIX10 and SIX12 were\ndetected in most Foc isolates, with minimal sequence polymorphism,\nexcept for SIX12. SIX8 and SIX9 were detected in all Fop isolates, with\nno sequence polymorphism. SIX10 was also present in seven of the Fop\nisolates, with sequences matching those of Foc. Phylogenetic trees were\nconstructed using sequences from this study and previously derived\nsequences from Foc isolates obtained in Australia, Canary Islands and\nJapan. The topology of housekeeping EF-1α gene indicated Foc is\npolyphyletic, with the Australian isolates separating into a distinct\ngroup from all other Foc isolates. However, the topologies of SIX1, SIX7\nand SIX10 for Foc indicate monophly. This suggests the core genome of\nFoc evolved into a separate lineage after the SIX genes were conserved\nwithin the whole genome. This study is the first to generate SIX12\nsequences for Foc, and only from the USA isolates. Interestingly, the\ntopology of SIX12 suggests polyphyly. The EF-1α, SIX8 and SIX9 gene\ntopologies support monophyly of Fop. The distinct SIX gene profile and\nEF-1α sequence of Fop demonstrates an independent evolutionary origin\nfrom Foc.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116764.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116765.phy"}]}
