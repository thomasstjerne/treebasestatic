The primary control method of these\npests is the use of chemical insecticides; however, alternative\nstrategies, friendlier to the environment and compatible with a regional\nprogramme of integrated pest management, are definitely needed.\nBiological control with the use of local entomopathogenic microorganisms\ncould be a sustainable solution. In this study, a biological screening\nwas conducted to characterize spore-forming bacilli for their capacity\nto kill larvae of this species. Bacillus thuringiensis, B. pumilus, B.\naryabhattai, B. amyloliquefaciens and Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus were\nidentified based on sequence analyses of 16S and partial GyrB gene.\nLysinibacilus xylanilyticus showed the highest mortality towards\nfirst-instar larvae fed with diet treated with spore suspensions.\nSpecific virulence factors like proteinaceous parasporal inclusions were\nobserved not only in isolates of B. thuringiensis but also in L.\nxylanilyticus. Ordering of isolates based on multivariate analysis of\nputative secondary virulence factors like biosurfactant and biofilm\nproduction, haemolytic activity and motility, separated the virulent\nisolate of L. xylanilyticus. This is the first report of L.\nxylanilyticus causing mortality in A. sphaleropa or any other member of\nLepidoptera. A search for more virulent strains of this species is\nenvisaged.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
