This variety is found to be\nnot phylogenetically close to G. schmidelii var. schmidelii, the type\nspecies of sect. Schmidelia, and it is therefore excluded for this\nsection, taxonomically raised to the specific level (as G. parvisporum),\nand included as a member of sect. Hariotia. On the other hand, a second\nspecies in Geastrum sect. Schmidelia is recognized and formally\ndescribed as Geastrum senoretae. It is characterized by its small\nbasidiomata, non-hygrometric exoperidium, subsessile endoperidium, and\nfinely plicate, indistinctly delimited peristome, being only known from\nSpain so far. Photographs and drawings are included, and a comparison\nwith close taxa is also given. The presence of sclerified basidia in the\nmature gleba, previously not reported in the genus, is commented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schmidelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71653.phy"}]}
