Previous studies typically had sparse taxon\nsampling and used limited DNA sequence data. Consequently, the majority\nof morphological hypotheses/classifications have never been tested using\nmolecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polystichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93871.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polystichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93872.phy"}]}
