Phylogenetic analyses based\non the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), the large subunit of\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA\ngene (mtSSU) indicated that the two new species were nested within the\ngenera Albatrellus sensu stricto and Scutiger. Albatrellus alpinus is\ncharacterized by buff to pale yellow pileal surface, clamped generative\nhyphae with yellow and shapeless oily substance, and small amyloid\nbasidiospores. Scutiger edulis is characterized by curry-yellow to\ncinnamon-buff pileal surface which becoming buff to olivaceous buff upon\ndrying, with coarse squamulose, and ellipsoid to teardrop-shaped,\nnon-amyloid basidiospores. Differences between the two new species and\ntheir similar species were discussed. A key to Chinese species of\nAlbatrellus sensu lato is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albatrellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132750.phy"}]}
