It is the largest genus in tribe Boechereae, which\nalso includes Anelsonia, Borodinia, Cusickiella, Nevada, Phoenicaulis,\nPolyctenium, and Sandbergia. Boechera is closely related to Arabidopsis\nand has become a model genus for a diverse array of studies, focusing\nparticularly on apomixis and hybrid speciation. As part of an ongoing\neffort to clarify the taxonomy of the group, we present phylogenetic\nanalyses of Boechereae, including all genera of the tribe and most of\nthe sexual diploid species of Boechera. Nine independent loci are used,\nincluding two plastid regions, nrDNA ITS, and seven low-copy nuclear\nloci. These phylogenetic analyses address intergeneric relationships\nwithin the tribe, monophyly of Boechera, and resolution of major groups\nwithin the genus. These analyses indicate that Boechera, as currently\ncircumscribed, is polyphyletic, comprising three main clades. Eastern\nNorth American species previously assigned to Boechera form a distinct\nclade with the Asian taxon Borodinia macrophylla and are herein\ntransferred to the genus Borodinia, resulting in seven new combinations\n(Borodinia burkii, Borodinia canadensis, Borodinia dentata, Borodinia\nlaevigata, Borodinia missouriensis, Borodinia perstellata, and Borodinia\nserotina). Boechera repanda, a morphologically aberrant species endemic\nto the Sierra Nevada, is independent of the other species of Boechera\nsensu lato and is recognized in the new genus Yosemitea (as Yosemitea\nrepanda). A primarily western North American clade comprising all\nremaining species is strongly supported and retains the name Boechera.\nAlthough resolution within Boechera sensu stricto is limited, a number\nof well-supported clades are identified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML RAxML","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera dpa1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53321.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML RAxML","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera plastid","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53315.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT RAxML","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera adh","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53317.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict WinClada","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera pistillata","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53312.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT RAxML","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera pistillata","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53313.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Con WinClada","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera plastid","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53314.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict WinClada","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera adh","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53316.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML RAxML","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera nuclear","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53319.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Con WinClada","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera nuclear","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53318.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict MP WinClada","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boechera dpa1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53320.phy"}]}
