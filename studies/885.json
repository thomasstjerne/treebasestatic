A phylogenetic analysis of loci combined according to\nspecies suggests that most of the tribe Millettieae belongs to one of\ntwo monophyletic clades: the Derris-Lonchocarpus or the Tephrosia clade.\nTogether these two form a monophyletic group that is sister to a lineage\nrepresented by Millettia grandis of Millettia sect. Compresso-gemmatae.\nCollectively, this large monophyletic group is referred to as the\nMillettieae-core groups, which based on our sampling, includes species\nof Millettieae that do not accumulate the nonprotein amino acid\ncanavanine and that mostly have pseudoracemose or pseudopaniculate\ninflorescences. This new phylogenetic framework assists in targeting\nadditional taxa for future sampling. For example, the American Derris\n(Deguelia), which accumulate canavanine, might not be members of the\nMillettieae core group. Afgekia is also predicted not to be a member\nbecause it accumulates canavanine and has an inflorescence of terminal\nracemes. PHY gene analysis specifically reveals that certain genera\ntraditionally classified in Millettieae are actually distantly related\nto the Millettieae core groups, such as Austrosteenisia, Callerya,\nCraibia, Cyclolobium, Fordia, Platycyamus, Poecilanthe, and\nWisteria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Millettieae PHY genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5700.phy"}]}
