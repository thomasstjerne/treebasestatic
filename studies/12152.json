It\nincludes the four nominal species: M. achaeta (Hagen, 1954), M. achaeta\nsensu Lasserre, 1964, M. nevisensis Righi & Kanner, 1979 and M.\narenaria Healy, 1979. We studied the genetic and morphological diversity\nof achaetous specimens of Marionina collected in Florida, USA; Great\nBarrier Reef, Queensland, Australia; New Caledonia; Sweden; England; and\nthe Bahamas. The collection localities are almost all supralittoral and\nvary from fully marine to brackish habitats; some are temporarily in\nfreshwater after rain. Parts of the mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S, COI,\nand the nuclear genes 18S, 28S, ITS were sequenced and analysed to\nassess the genetic variation and estimate the phylogeny of the achaetous\nMarionina species. The molecular data reveal one monophyletic group of\nat least nine separately evolving lineages: M. achaeta sensu Lasserre,\n1964, M. nevisensis s.str., M. sp. A, M. sp. B, M. sp. D, M. sp. E, M.\nsp. H, M. sp. I and M. sp. J, most of which are not associated with any\ndescribed nominal taxon. Variation in COI, shows high diversity, both\nwithin (up to 10.4 %) and between lineages (15.6-25 %). Morphologically,\nhowever, we can discriminate only seven lineages. Marionina nevisensis\ns.str., M. sp. D, and E match the description of M. nevisensis and are\ntherefore considered to be cryptic species. We also select a neotype for\nM. nevisensis from the Caribbean region, and as Lasserres (1964) M.\nachaeta appears to be morphologically different from its (then) senior\nhomonym M. achaeta (Hagen, 1954), we propose a placement name, M.\nnothachaeta nom.nov., for it.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1 COI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49807.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 2 all genes","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"All genes, Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3 mitochondrial","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mitochondrial, Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49809.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 4 nuclear","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nuclear, Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49810.phy"}]}
