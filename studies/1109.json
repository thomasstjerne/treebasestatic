The analysis included individuals from\n37 populations of 20 Bursaphelenchus species from Europe, North America,\nCentral America and Asia representing much of the known biological\ndiversity in this genus. Phylogenetic analysis, using several methods of\ninference based on SSR, LSU and mtCOI 0-fold degenerate sequences were\ncongruent, with the greatest resolution obtained with combined datasets.\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed B. abruptus as the basal taxon among all\ninvestigated Bursaphelenchus species and a large number of significantly\nsupported monophyletic groups. These clades are largely consistent with\nmorphological and life history variation in the genus. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of LSU rDNA sequences revealed the existence of cryptic species\nof B. mucronatus, B xylophilus and B. sexdentati. One monotypic genus,\nRhadinaphelenchus (Hunt, 1993) (=B. cocophilus [Cobb, 1919] Baujard,\n1989) was found to be included significantly within the Bursaphelenchus\nradiation. The molecular phylogeny also supports the novel nature of\nthree previously unnamed species. While SSU, LSU and mtCOI gene\nsequences are useful for inferring phylogenetic relationships in this\nanalysis, the LSU dataset was most informative across this genus. The\nmtDNA data was severely limited by non-stationary base composition and\napparent saturation above the species level, and the conservative\nevolution of the SSU data limited the number of phylogenetically\ninformative sites derived from that dataset.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, SSU, LSU, and mtCOI 0-fold degenerate\nseq","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_635.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4d","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sexdentati, mtCOI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1705.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1702.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1698.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1699.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, mtCOI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursaphelenchus, mtCOI 0-fold degenerate","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1701.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4c","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sexdentati, 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1704.phy"}]}
