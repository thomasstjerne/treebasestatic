Hyphoderma sinense is characterized by the\nresupinate basidiomata with smooth hymenial surface, presence of\nencrusted and moniliform cystidia, and cylindrical to allantoid\nbasidiospores measuring as 811.5×35µm. Hyphoderma floccosum is\ncharacterized by the farinaceous hymenial surface, tubular cystidia and\nleptocystidia, and ellipsoid to allantoid basidiospores. Sequences of\nITS+nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated and\nphylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian inference methods. These phylogenetic analyses\nbased on molecular data of ITS+nLSU sequences showed that two new\nspecies clustered into Hyphoderma, in which H. sinense grouped with H.\ntransiens, and H. floccosum grouped with a clade comprising H. pinicola,\nH. setigerum and H. subsetigerum. The new taxa are described,\nillustrated, and compared and contrasted to morphologically similar\nspecies. An identification key to 23 accepted species in China is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131650.phy"}]}
