Mycorrhizal fungal strains were isolated and selected\nfrom root samples of three species of rupicolous and epiphytic tropical\nterrestrial orchids that are native to Brazil: Encyclia dichroma, E.\nghillanyi and Brassavola tuberculata. Epulorhiza amonilioides sp. nov.\nis distinguished from the other species of Epulorhiza by the absence of\nmonilioid cells in pure culture. Phylogenetic analyses based on 5.8S ITS\nrDNA and mtLSU indicated that E. amonilioides is phylogenetically\ndifferent from other fungal lineages of Tulasnella previously identified\non tropical and temperate orchid and Sebacinaceae species. E.\namonilioides forms a different clade that groups with some anamorphic\nmycorrhizal fungi corresponding to Tulasnella irregularis. E.\namonilioides is strictly related to T. irregularis, its putative\nteleomorph. E. amonilioides is the seventh species described for the\ngenus and is the second from Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Almeida_et_al_tree_mtLSUUU","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43850","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43850.phy"}]}
