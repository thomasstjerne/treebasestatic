Members of this\ngroup are defined by their sharp epidermal prickles, thus being commonly\nreferred to as the \u001aspiny solanums\u001a. This subgenus includes a number of\neconomically important species such as the Old World eggplants, as well\nas locally cultivated New World species such as the naranjilla and\ncocona. Given the size and importance of this group we have examined\nphylogenetic relationships across subgenus Leptostemonum, including a\nlarge sampling of species from previously defined species groups within\nthe subgenus. Evolutionary relationships were inferred using DNA\nsequence data from two nuclear regions [ITS and the granule-bound starch\nsynthase gene (GBSSI or waxy)] and one chloroplast spacer region\n(trnS-trnG). Results suggest that Solanum subgenus Leptostemonum is\nmonophyletic when the S. wendlandii and S. nemorense species groups are\nexcluded. We have defined 10 well supported clades within subgenus\nLeptostemonum, some of which correspond to previously circumscribed\nspecies groups or sections. Most of the Old World species of subgenus\nLeptostemonum belong to a single species-rich clade. Spines and/or\nstellate hairs evolved more than once in Solanum, and floral heterandry\noriginated multiple times within the \u001aspiny solanums\u001a.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 1-2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spiny Solanums","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2204.phy"}]}
