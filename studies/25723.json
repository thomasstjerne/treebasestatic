Karst. is a cosmopolitan genus of white-rot\nfungi which comprises species with highly-prized pharmaceutical\nproperties, valuable biotechnological applications and of significant\nphytopatho-logical interest. However, the status of the taxonomy within\nthe genus is still highly controversial and ambiguous despite the\nprogress made through molecular approaches. A metadata analysis of 3908\nnuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences\nobtained from GenBank/ENA/DDBJ and UNITE was performed by targeting\nsequences annotated as Ganoderma, but also sequences from environ-mental\nsamples and from material examined for the first time. Ganoderma taxa\nsegregated into five main lineages (Clades A to E). Clade A corresponds\nto the core of laccate species and includes G. shanxiense and three\nmajor well-supported clusters: Cluster A.1 (‘G. lucidum sensu lato’)\nconsists of taxa from Eurasia and North America, Cluster A.2 of material\nwith worldwide occurrence including G. resinaceum and Cluster A.3 is\ncomposed of species originating from all continents except Europe and\ncomprises G. lingzhi. Clade B includes G. applanatum and allied species\nwith a Holarctic distribution. Clade C comprises taxa from Asia and\nAfrica only. Clade D consists of laccate taxa with tropical/subtropical\noccurrence, while clade E harbours the highest number of non-laccate\nspecies with a cosmopolitan distribution. The 92 Ganoderma-associated\nnames, initially used for sequences labelling, correspond to at least 80\ntaxa. Amongst them, 21 constitute putatively new phylospecies after our\napplication of criteria relevant to the robustness/support of the\nterminal clades, intra- and interspecific genetic divergence and\navailable biogeographic data. Moreo-ver, several other groups or\nindividual sequences seem to represent distinct taxonomic entities and\nmerit further investigation. A particularly large number of the public\nsequences was revealed to be insufficiently and/or incorrectly\nidentified, for example, 87% and 78% of entries labelled as G. australe\nand G. lucidum, respectively. In general, ITS demonstrated high efficacy\nin resolving relationships amongst most of the Ganoderma taxa; however,\nit was not equally useful at elucidating species barriers across the\nentire genus and such cases are outlined. Furthermore, we draw\nconclusions on biogeography by evaluating species occurrence on a global\nscale in conjunction with phylogenetic structure/patterns. The sequence\nvariability assessed in ITS spacers could be further exploited for\ndiagnostic purposes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126497.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"369","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126542","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126542.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"455","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126484.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"265","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126490.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126496.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"455","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126485.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126489","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126489.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126488.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"343","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126493.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"343","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126492.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126495.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126494.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"265","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126491.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"369","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126543.phy"}]}
