Phylogenetic analyses based on nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and\npartial 28S rDNA, and partial sequences of genes for RNA polymerase II\nsubunits 1 and 2 confirmed the generic placement of the three new\nspecies. Coltricia lateralis is characterized by small, laterally\nstipitate basidiocarps, obtuse pileus margin, cinnamon-buff to honey\nyellow pore surface, and broadly ellipsoid basidiospores that measure\n7-8 × 5-6 µm. Coltricia rigida is characterized by large, woody-hard\nfan-shaped basidiocarps, small pores (7-8 per mm), presence of septate\nsclerified hyphae, and subglobose to globose basidiospores that measure\n6-7 × 5-6.5 μm. Coltricia wenshanensis is characterized by centrally\nstipitate basidiocarps, a distinctly concentrically zonate and sulcate\npileal surface, large pores (0.5-2 per mm), and broadly ellipsoid to\nsubglobose basidiospores that measure 7.5-8 × 6-7 µm.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118202.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118220.phy"}]}
