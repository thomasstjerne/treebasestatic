Their biodiversity, host associations and\ngeographical distributions are not well documented. ITS rDNA sequences\nof Tuber are commonly recovered from molecular surveys of fungal\ncommunities, but most remain insufficiently identified making it\ndifficult to determine whether these sequences represent conspecific or\nnovel taxa. In this meta-analysis, over 2000 insufficiently identified\nTuber sequences from 76 independent studies were analysed within a\nphylogenetic framework. Species ranges, host associates, geographical\ndistributions and intra- and interspecific ITS variability were\nassessed. Over 99% of the insufficiently identified Tuber sequences\ngrouped within clades composed of species with little culinary value\n(Maculatum, Puberulum and Rufum). Sixty-four novel phylotypes were\ndistinguished including 36 known only from ectomycorrhizae or soil. Most\nspecies of Tuber showed 1-3% intraspecific ITS variability and >4%\ninterspecific ITS sequence variation. We found 123 distinct phylotypes\nbased on 96% ITS sequence similarity and estimated that Tuber contains a\nminimum of 180 species. Based on this meta-analysis, species in\nExcavatum, Maculatum and Rufum clades exhibit preference for angiosperm\nhosts, whereas those in the Gibbosum clade are preferential towards\ngymnosperms. Sixteen Tuber species (>13% of the known diversity) have\nputatively been introduced to continents or islands outside their native\nrange.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber Maculatum Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58374.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58027.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58036.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber Maculatum Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58373.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58035.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58034.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58033.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58032.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58031.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58030.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58029.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58028.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58039.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58038.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig1 Tuber ITS GuideTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber Puberulum Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber Rufum Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber Maculatum Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58372.phy"}]}
