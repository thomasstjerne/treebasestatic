Overlapping\ngenes (genes partially or entirely overlapping) represent a genomic\nfeature that is shared widely between biological organisms ranging from\nviruses to multi-cellular organisms. In bacteria, a third of the\nannotated genes are involved in an overlap. Despite the widespread\nnature of this arrangement, its evolutionary origins and biological\nramifications have so far eluded explanation. Results Here we present a\ncomparative approach using information from 699 bacterial genomes that\nsheds light on the evolutionary dynamics of overlapping genes. We show\nthat these structures exhibit high levels of plasticity. Conclusions We\npropose a simple model allowing us to explain the observed properties of\noverlapping genes based on the importance of initiation and termination\nof transcriptional and translational processes. We believe that taking\ninto account the processes leading to the expression of protein-coding\ngenes hold the key to the understanding of overlapping genes\nstructures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"684","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"699 bacterial genomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77477.phy"}]}
