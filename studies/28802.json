In this paper, the molecular phylogenetic analyses of\nthe nuclear ribosomal ITS (internal transcribed spacer: ITS1-5.8S-ITS2)\nand LSU (large sub-unit: 28S) sequences combining with morphological\ncharacteristics identified three new species from Xinjiang Autonomous\nRegion in Northwest China, which were named T. aurantispora, T.\nkanasensis and T. schrenkiana. Some similar macromorphological and\nanatomical characteristics can be shared for these new species,\nincluding arachnoid basidiocarps, byssoid sterile margins, utriform\nbasidia with a clamp connection at base, the absence of rhizomorphs and\ncystidia, and slightly thick-walled, subglobose to globose\nbasidiospores. Among these new species, color of the hymenophoral\nsurface, the size of the basidiospores and some other features can be\nspread apart from each other. The new species and closely related\nspecies in the phylogenetic tree were discussed, and a key to the\nidentified species of Tomentella from China was provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"217","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133740","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133740.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"217","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133741","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133741.phy"}]}
