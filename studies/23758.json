Especially widespread and diverse is Apiognomonia errabunda found\nmostly on beech, oak and linden. A. errabunda along with its most\nrelated species are known for their complicated phylogenetic\nrelationships that have caused considerable confusion in the past. In\nthe present paper we describe the results of a three-gene based\nreconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between A. errabunda , A.\nveneta and A. hystrix for 373 isolates. Using combined information from\nthe ITS region and intron regions of actin and calmodulin for 263\nisolates we confirmed the occurrence of host associated lineages within\nA. errabunda. However, the clustering of isolates by host species was\nuncomplete: some isolates occurred on the ‘wrong’ hosts and a number of\nisolates carried mixed genetic profile indicating substantial level of\ninter-host group recombination. In addition, a number of isolates were\nidentified as putative, pending further verification, interspecies\nhybrids between the much more divergent A. errabunda and A.\nhystrix.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115316","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115316.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115317","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115317.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115318.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115319.phy"}]}
