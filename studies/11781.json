Our results indicate that this species is only distantly\nrelated to both Spiranthes and Cyclopogon, the genera in which it has\nbeen included by previous taxonomists, being instead recovered as sister\nto a clade formed by Eurystyles and Lankesterella with strong support\nfrom the Bayesian analysis. The new, monotypic genus Quechua is proposed\nto accommodate former “S.” glabrescens, which differs from both\nEurystyles and Lankesterella in habit as well as in vegetative and\nreproductive characters. The main ecological and structural features of\nQuechua are discussed and compared with those of other genera of\nSpiranthinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"one of two MPTs","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Quechua; nrITs, matK/trnK and trnL/trnF MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70116.phy"}]}
