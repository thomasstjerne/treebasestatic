In\ncontrast, interactions between filamentous fungi and soil algae that can\nbe observed with the naked eye have been given little attention and\nremain unexplored. Here, we report a fungus that was associated with a\nvisible symptom of dead algae on a soil surface in Sugadaira-kogen,\nNagano, central Japan. Acremonium-like conidiophores were growing on\nvesicles and dead bodies of a yellow-green alga, Botrydium granulatum.\nThe fungus was identified as Emericellopsis mirabilis based on its\nmorphology by microscopic observation, phylogenetic analysis, and the\nsimilarity of the isolation substrate with the first description of the\nspecies. Co-culture experiments showed a filamentous cell\ndifferentiation of the alga by the fungus, but no harmful or beneficial\neffects on algal growth. Therefore, we speculate that E. mirabilis is a\nfacultative parasite of B. granulatum under natural conditions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135801.phy"}]}
