To survive and\nproliferate in the host, they have evolved mechanisms for detoxification\nand elimination of host defense compounds, efficient nutrient\nsequestration, and, in the case of pathogens, virulence towards plants.\nIn this work, we assembled a draft genome of the spruce pathogen\nOphiostoma bicolor. For our comparative and phylogenetic analyses, we\nmined the genomes of closely related species (O. piceae, O. ulmi, O.\nnovo-ulmi and Grosmannia clavigera). Our aim was to acquire a genomic\nand evolutionary perspective of gene families important in host\ncolonization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"221","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101151.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101152.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101153.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101154.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101155.phy"}]}
