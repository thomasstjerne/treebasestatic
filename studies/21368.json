This new\nspecies found in India and Thailand is characterized by the centrally\nstipitate medium sized basidiomata, orange to reddish brown pileus,\nwhite to brownish orange lamellae, and white stipe. Based on morphology,\nC. asiaticus is similar to the Neotropical C. thermophilus. However, the\nmicroscopic characters, especially the size and shape of the\nbasidiospores, can be used to distinguish these two taxa, as well as\ntheir geographic distributions. Further, the phylogenetic position of C.\nasiaticus is unique based on ITS and 28S nuc rDNA sequences.\nMelanomphalia argipoda, described by Singer from Ecuador, is also a\nstipitate Crepidotus based on the ITS sequence of the type specimen, so\nthe new combination is proposed here. Phylogenetically, the three\nspecies form a monophyletic group with the Asiatic C. asiaticus forming\nthe sister lineage to the Neotropical C. argipodus and C.\nthermophilus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crepidotus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crepidotus LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119081.phy"}]}
