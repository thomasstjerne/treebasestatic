We\nreport the presence of Mesorhizobium, a genus best known for its\nnitrogen-fixing symbiosis with terrestrial legumes, associated with the\nmarine polychaete Meganerilla bactericola (MÃ¼ller, Bernhard, &\nJouin-Toulmond 2001) (Annelida: Nerillidae). Abundant ectosymbionts were\npreviously described as coating the exterior of M. bactericola, which is\nfound within the anoxic sulfide-oxidizing microbial mats of the Santa\nBarbara Basin, California, USA. We identified rhizobia associated with\nthis worm using phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and three additional\nfunctional genes, nifH, atpD, and recA, and group-specific fluorescence\nin situ hybridization (FISH).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58763","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58763.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
