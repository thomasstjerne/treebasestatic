Landvik. Phylogenetic analyses of\napproximately 1700 basepairs of the nuclear ribosomal small subunit DNA\nsequences from Pindara terrestris and 43 other ascomycetes, group\nPindara with Helvella (including Wynnella) among the genera Balsamia,\nBarssia, and Underwoodia, all Helvellaceae. The nrDNA sequence\ndivergence within Helvella is high, and the NS3-NS4 SSU rDNA exhibit\nsignature sequences that characterize each of several groups within\nHelvellaceae. A description of newly collected specimens of Pindara from\nNorway is provided and illustrated by light and scanning electron\nmicrographs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished ITS tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pindara","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6983.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pindara: A single tree obtained after succesive\nweighting of the SSU rDNA matrix","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6984.phy"}]}
