In present study, the potential of such technique in zoological\nsystematics was assessed. For the first time, 3D printed models were\nincorporated in the description of a new genus as a complement to\npictures and drawings to illustrate complex 3D structures and to be used\nin education. Hereby, we also tested the performances of different\nprinting materials and forwarded resin as the most suitable option for\nthe zoological field. As a case study, Labrys chinensis gen. nov., sp.\nnov. was described using an integrative approach: detailed morphology\nbased on light- and electron microscopy, phylogenetic position as\nrevealed from two ribosomal RNA genes, generic traits were tested for\nhomoplasy, and the intra- and inter-population variations of four\nrecovered populations were analyzed. The new genus belongs to subfamily\nTylenchinae, family Tylenchidae and infraorder Tylenchomorpha. It is\ncharacterized by unique labial plate that has four narrow lobes with\ntips detached from adjacent cuticle, laterally broad elongated amphidial\napertures, a strong sclerotized excretory duct, round spacious\npostvulval uterine sac, and spicule with a sharp protrusion at\nblade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"28S","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylenchomorpha 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105680.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylenchomorpha 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105681.phy"}]}
