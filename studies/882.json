The ITS area was shown to contain a substantial amount of\nvariation which resolves the relationships of terminal groups, while the\nmore basal clades have low support in the analyses. D. miniatum var.\nminiatum and D. miniatum var. complicatum are polyphyletic while D.\nminiatum var. cirsodes is monophyletic but located within the complex as\nare both D. leptophyllum and D. linkolae. While the D. miniatum-complex\nvaries in the ITS sequences, some transatlantic species such as D.\nluridum and D. meiophyllizum only differ in a few base pairs.\nDermatocarpon taminium sp. nov. from the Greater Sonoran area is\ndescribed and D. tenue comb. nov. is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dermatocarpon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5697.phy"}]}
