The results support a close phylogenetic\nrelationship between the subfamily Altingioideae (Hamamelidaceae) and\nPlantanaceae but suggest that present hypotheses concerning the\nderivation of the Hamamelidae from the Magnoliidae need revision.\nAnalysis of the five subfamilies of Hamamelidaceae using Plantanaceae as\nan outgroup yields a phylogeny that corresponds to the fossil record far\nbetter than does current theory. As a result of this study and recent\npaloebotanical and phytochemical evidence, it is suggested that\nHamamelidae are at least as primitive as Magnoliidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4259.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4260.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4261.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4262.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4257.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4258.phy"}]}
