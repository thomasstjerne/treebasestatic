One of these species, C. apterus, from\nEcuadorian p√°ramo above 4000 m, lacks wings and has reduced halters. A\npreliminary phylogeny of the genera and species groups of the\nCeratomerinae is presented, with a discussion of the generic concept of\nCeratomerus Philippi. A provisional biogeographic hypothesis of this\nGondwanan lineage is discussed. Significant relationships include the\nSouthern Gondwana Pattern, the Inverted Southern Pattern and the\nNeotropical C. paradoxus group evolved within the Australian C.\ncampbelli group, illustrating both an intra-generic and intercontinental\npattern.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratomerus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9807.phy"}]}
