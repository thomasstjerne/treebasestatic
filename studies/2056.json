Using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data,\nwe evaluate the relative importance of Pleistocene and pre-Pleistocene\nevents within the evolutionary history of the Mexican iguana Ctenosaura\npectinata, and related species. Results support the existence of cryptic\nlineages with strong mitochondrial divergence (>4%) among them. Some\nof these lineages form zones of secondary contact, with one of them\nhybridizing with C. hemilopha. Evolutionary network analyses reveal the\noldest populations of C. pectinata to be those of the northern and\nsouthern Mexican coastal regions. Inland and mid-latitudinal coastal\npopulations are younger in age as a consequence of a history of local\nextinction within these regions followed by re-colonization. Estimated\ndivergence times suggest that C. pectinata originated during the\nPliocene, whereas geographically distinct mtDNA lineages first started\nto diverge during the Pliocene, with subsequent divergence continuing\nthrough the Pleistocene. Our results highlight the influence of both\nPliocene and Pleistocene events in shaping the geographic distribution\nof genetic variation within neotropical lowland organisms. Areas of high\ngenetic diversity in southern Mexico were detected, this finding plus\nthe high levels of genetic diversity within C. pectinata, have\nimplications for the conservation of this threatened species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ND4 supported clades","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5188.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ND4 Iguaninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5189.phy"}]}
