The present paper focuses on two\ngenera of microfungi, Camarosporium and Dothiora, which are respectively\nepi- and neotypified. The genus Camarosporium is typified by C.\nquaternatum, which has a karstenula-like sexual morph, and phoma-like\nsynasexual morph. Furthermore, Camarosporomyces, Foliophoma and\nHazslinszkyomyces are introduced as new camarosporium-like genera, while\nQuerciphoma is introduced as a new phoma-like genus. Libertasomycetaceae\nis introduced as a new family to accommodate Libertasomyces and\nNeoplatysporoides. Dothiora, which is typified by D. pyrenophora, is\nshown to produce dothichiza- and hormonema-like synasexual morphs in\nculture, and D. cactacearum is introduced as a new species. In addition\nto their typification, ex-type cultures have been deposited in the\nWesterdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (CBS Culture Collection), and\nspecies-specific DNA barcodes in GenBank. Authors interested in\ncontributing accounts of individual genera to larger multi-authored\npapers in this series should contact the associate editors listed on the\nList of Protected Generic Names for Fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Camarosporium and Dothiora LSU overview","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105279.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidea ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105281.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paracamarosporium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105282.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Camarosporium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105280.phy"}]}
