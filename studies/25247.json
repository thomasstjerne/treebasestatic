Triblidium is the type genus and is\ncharacterized by melanized apothecia that occur scattered or in small\nclusters on the substratum, cleistohymenial (opening in the mesohymenial\nphase), inamyloid thin-walled asci, and hyaline muriform ascospores.\nBefore this study, only the type species, Triblidium caliciiforme, had\nDNA sequences in NCBI GenBank. In this study, six specimens of\nTriblidium were collected from China and France and new ITS, mtSSU, LSU\nand RPB2 sequences were generated. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis\nand morphological study demonstrated three new species of Triblidium,\nwhich are formally described here: T. hubeiense, T. rostriforme and T.\nyunnanense. Additionally, our results indicated that Huangshania that\nwas considered to be distinct from Triblidium because of its elongated,\ntransversely-septate ascospores is congeneric with Triblidium.\nTherefore, we have placed Huangshania in synonymy under Triblidium,\nrendering Tribliblidiaceae a monotypic family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120196","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120196.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120197","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120197.phy"}]}
