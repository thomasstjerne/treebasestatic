The taxon is represented by c. 300 bones that were found\nassociated with large fossilized tree trunks and were collected from the\ninterface of sandstone and mudstone units covering an area of c. 276 m2.\nThe collection includes one partial skeleton; most of the remainder of\nthe bones were disarticulated, disassociated and dispersed, but\ntaphonomic analysis permits recognition of associated elements\ncomprising several individuals. Skeletal anatomy of Barapasaurus\nincludes several teeth, vertebrae from the caudal cervicals rearward to\nthe terminal caudals, and most elements of the appendicular skeleton.\nBarapasaurus is characterized by spoon-shaped teeth with bulbous bases\nand grooves on the anterolabial and posterolingual sides of the crown,\ncoarse tubercles on the carina, acamerate cranial and dorsal vertebrae,\nlateral laminae of the middle and caudal dorsal neural spines composed\nof spinodiapophyseal and spinopostzygapo- physeal laminae, neural canal\nof the mid-dorsal vertebrae opens dorsally through a narrow slit into a\nlarge cavity and sacrum with four co-ossified vertebrae. Phylogenetic\nanalysis reveals that Barapasaurus is basal in comparison with\nVulcanodon and is removed from Eusauropoda.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 17","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55514.phy"}]}
