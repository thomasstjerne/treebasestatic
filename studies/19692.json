UK red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have\nincreasingly been observed with leprosy-like lesions on the head and\nlimbs. Using genomics, histopathology and serology we found M.\nlepromatosis in squirrels from England, Ireland and Scotland, and M.\nleprae in squirrels from Brownsea Island, England. Infection was\ndetected in overtly diseased and seemingly healthy animals. Phylogenetic\ncomparisons of British and Irish M. lepromatosis with two Mexican\nstrains from humans showed they diverged from a common ancestor around\n27,000 years ago whereas the M. leprae strain is closest to one that\ncirculated in Medieval England. Red squirrels are thus a reservoir for\nleprosy in the British Isles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 9","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 9","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97715.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobacterium leprae NJ p-distance tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97717.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97720.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97719.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97725.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 5","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97723.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97722.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 3","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97721.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 6","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. lepromatosis MP tree 6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97724.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97710.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97709.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 6","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97712.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobacterium lepromatosis BEAST tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97718.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 8","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 8","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97714.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 10","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 10","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97716.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4B M. lepromatosis MP tree 8","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobacterium lepromatosis MP tree 8","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97726.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobacterium leprae BEAST tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97727.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 7","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97713.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 5","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97711.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"M. leprae MP tree 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97708.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4A M. leprae MP tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycobacterium leprae MP tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97707.phy"}]}
