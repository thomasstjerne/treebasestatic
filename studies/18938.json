Tuber japonicum is characterized by its twospored asci and\npale yellow irregularly reticulate ascospores. Tuber flavidosporum has\none ascospore per ascus, which is similar to some related species in\nChina, but is distinguishable by its large reticulate ornamentation.\nMolecular phylogenetic analysis also supports T. japonicum and T.\nflavidosporum as new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108554.phy"}]}
