We studied\nthe cophylogeny of species of three genera of Monopisthocotylea,\nLamellodiscus, Dactylogyrus and Gyrodactylus, and their fish hosts to\ndetermine which evolutionary events determine speciation and identify a\ncommon set of principles driving coevolution in the three\nhost-monogenean systems studied. We used an event-based method (Jane)\nand a distance-base method (PACo) for cophylogenetic analysis. PACo\nrevealed a significant coevolution signal in all three systems. In the\nsignificant coevolutionary scenarios retrieved by Jane, the number of\ncospeciations was always low, the number of failures to diverge was\nalways high and relatively constant, and the number of losses was always\nthe highest. The number of duplications and duplications with\nhost-switching was more variable, but relatively high in most\nsituations. These results suggest that speciation in the three\nhost-monogenean systems is not driven primarily by the classical\nsynchronic cospeciation process postulated for terrestrial host-parasite\nsystems. Instead, pseudocospeciation (associated to host-switches),\nduplication and failure to diverge seemed to play a major role in\nshaping the current diversity and relationships to their hosts of the\nmonogeneans studied. Therefore, evolutionary mechanisms leading to host\nspecificity do not seem to primarily result from cospeciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Dactylogyrus Fish Hosts ML Tree from cytb","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dactylogyrus Fish Hosts ML Tree from cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dactylogyrus ML Tree from 18S-ITS1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dactylogyrus ML Tree from 18S-ITS1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gyrodactylus ML Tree from 5.8S-ITS2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus ML Tree from 5.8S-ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_107396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lamellodiscus BI Tree from 18S","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamellodiscus BI Tree from 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103827.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lamellodiscus ML Tree from 18S","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamellodiscus ML Tree from 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103828.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lamellodiscus Fish Hosts ML Tree from cytb-16S","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamellodiscus Fish Hosts ML Tree from cytb-16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lamellodiscus Fish Hosts BI Tree from cytb-16S","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamellodiscus Fish Hosts BI Tree from cytb-16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103829.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dactylogyrus BI Tree from 18S-ITS1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dactylogyrus BI Tree from 18S-ITS1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dactylogyrus Fish Hosts BI Tree from cytb","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dactylogyrus Fish Hosts BI Tree from cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gyrodactylus BI Tree from 5.8S-ITS2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus BI Tree from 5.8S-ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_107395.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gyrodactylus Fish Hosts BI Tree from 12S-16S","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Fish Hosts BI Tree from 12S-16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gyrodactylus Fish Hosts ML Tree from 12S-16S","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gyrodactylus Fish Hosts ML Tree from 12S-16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103838.phy"}]}
