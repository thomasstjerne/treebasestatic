Maximum\nparsimony analysis of the ITS/ 5.8S RNA, partial act, cal, chs1, gapdh,\nhis3 and tub2 gene regions identified morphologically similar species,\nC. cymbidiicola, C. karstii and C. phyllanthi from diverse plant samples\nof Indian origin. Morphological description and photographic\nillustrations of C. phyllanthi from freshly collected material are\nprovided, as the ex-type culture of C. phyllanthi deposited in CBS is in\nnon- sporulating state. This is the first report of C. cymbidiicola and\nC. karstii from India. We are also reporting two new hosts: Bauhinia\nvariegata (Orchid tree) and Bougainvillea glabra (Paper flower) for C.\nphyllanthi and one new host: Olea dioica (Rose sandalwood) for C.\nkarstii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP analysis showing phylogenetic affinities of six\nfungal isolates from India","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum boninense sp. complex India mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60098.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum boninense sp. complex India mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60100.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum boninense sp. complex bootstrap-con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60099.phy"}]}
