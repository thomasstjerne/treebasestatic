To examine whether\nthe morphological and geographical patterns hide phylogenetic lineages,\nwe inferred the phylogeny of Podoscypha based on multigene analyses of\nthe mitochondrial (mtSSU) and nuclear (5.8S rDNA and nucSSU) genes.\nIrrespective of the analysis method employed, the mtSSU and concatenated\nphylogenies significantly provided better resolution and all of the\nPodoscypha species formed a strongly supported clade together with the\nporoid species Abortiporus biennis (Meruliaceae). This result\nconsistently supported Podoscypha as a monophyletic genus, but called\ninto question the validity of the genus Abortiporus. Further resolution\nin the Podoscypha clade separated a distinct basal lineage including\nspecies with tomentose pileus, suggesting the division of the genus into\ntwo genera. We erect a new genus, Crinipileoscypha gen. nov., to\naccommodate all species morphologically distinguished by the combination\nof tomentose pileus, trimitic hyphal system, and thick-walled incrusted\nmetuloid cystidia. Among the remaining Podoscypha species, relationships\nwere weakly resolved and the delimited species groupings showed\ninterspecific similarity and intraspecific variation, and were not\ncorroborated by the ongoing morphological circumscription in the\ngenus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
