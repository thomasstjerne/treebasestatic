Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS\nand matK sequences alone and in combination using maximum parsimony\nmethods produced a moderately supported topology within Alpinioideae.\nOur results indicated that Amomum as currently defined is polyphyletic\nwith three major groups of species that do not correspond with any\npreviously recognized sectional classification of the genus. Our\nanalyses also identified Paramomum as sister to Elettariopsis, which are\nboth embedded within one group of Amomum. The other two groups of Amomum\nshare common ancestors with additional genera of the Alpinioideae. ITS\nand matK sequences provide new data for inferring relationships within\nAmomum and allow fresh interpretations of morphological characters (such\nas anther appendage and fruit type) that may be of value in future\nclassifications.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amomum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amomum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1812.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amomum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1813.phy"}]}
