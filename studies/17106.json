MAPK cascade is known to be an\nevolutionarily conserved signaling module involved in multiple stresses.\nAlthough the gene sequences of MAPK and MAPKK family have been fully\nidentified in B. distachyon, the information related to the upstream\nMAPKKK gene family especially the regulatory network among MAPKs, MAPKKs\nand MAPKKKs upon multiple stresses remains to be understood. Results: In\nthis study, we have identified MAPKKKs which belong to the biggest gene\nfamily of MAPK cascade kinases. We have systematically investigated the\nevolution of whole MAPK cascade kinase gene family in terms of gene\nstructures, protein structural organization, chromosomal localization,\northologs construction and gene duplication analysis. Our results showed\nthat most BdMAPK cascade kinases were located at the low-CpG-density\nregion, and the clustered members in each group shared similar\nstructures of the genes and proteins. Synteny analysis showed that 62 or\n21 pairs of duplicated orthologs were present between B. distachyon and\nOryza sativa, or between B. distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana\nrespectively. Gene expression data revealed that BdMAPK cascade kinases\nwere rapidly regulated by stresses and phytohormones. Importantly, we\nhave constructed a regulation network based on co-expression patterns of\nthe expression profiles upon multiple stresses performed in this study.\nConclusions: BdMAPK cascade kinases were involved in the signaling\npathways of multiple stresses in B. distachyon. The network of\nco-expression regulation showed the most of duplicated BdMAPK cascade\nkinase gene orthologs demonstrated their convergent function, whereas\nfew of them developed divergent function in the evolutionary process.\nThe molecular evolution analysis of identified MAPK family genes and the\nconstructed MAPK cascade regulation network under multiple stresses\nprovide valuable information for further investigation of the functions\nof BdMAPK cascade kinase genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
