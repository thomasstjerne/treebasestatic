While studies aiming to disentangle the molecular\nramifications of these processes are progressing, we still know little\nabout the genetic basis of evolutionary transitions in reproductive\nsystems. Here we conduct the first comparative analysis of sperm\nproteomes in Lepidoptera, a group that exhibits dichotomous\nspermatogenesis, in which males produce a functional\nfertilization-competent sperm (eupyrene) and an incompetent sperm morph\nlacking nuclear DNA (apyrene). Through the integrated application of\nevolutionary proteomics and genomics, we characterize the genomic\npatterns potentially associated with the origination and evolution of\nthis unique spermatogenic process and assess the importance of genetic\nnovelty in Lepidopteran sperm biology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"AA MLT","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sperm proteomic analysis in Lepidoptera mnlOpt","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107758.phy"}]}
