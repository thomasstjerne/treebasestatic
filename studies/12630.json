In addition, we studied comparatively micro- and\nmacromorphological characteristics of representative species. The\ntraditional generic classification based on morphological\ncharacteristics is not reflected by molecular phylogenies. Ancestral\nstate reconstructions indicated that the morphology of basidia and\nclamp-connections are evolutionarily stable. In contrast, basidiocarps\nand basidiospore septation patterns appear variable. Dacrymyces\nunisporus shares the typical dolipores with non-perforate parenthesomes\nwith the other dacrymycetous taxa, but is a unique species in having\npredominantly non-bifurcate basidia and subglobose to ovoid\nbasidiospores with transverse and longitudinal septations. In molecular\nphylogenies this species is a member of Dacrymycetes, but always\noccupies a basal position clearly separated from all other species\nstudied. Based on our results we propose a new genus, Unilacryma, for D.\nunisporus. For proper accommodation of this taxon, we introduce the\nfamily Unilacrymaceae and the order Unilacrymales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 18S","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53058.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 rpb2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53054.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 ITS","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53056.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 18S","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53057.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 D1D2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53055.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Multi","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53059.phy"}]}
