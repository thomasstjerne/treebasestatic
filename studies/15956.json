{"Authors":" Jeremy Hayward, Thomas R Horton","Year":" 2014","Title":" Phylogenetic trait conservation in the thelephoroid\nassociates of Pisonieae species indicates a conserved ectomycorrhizal\nassociation","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Pisonia, Thelephoroids, ectomycorrhizas","DOI":"","Abstract":" Reports of nonrandom patterns of association in\nectomycorrhizal symbiosis, usually described as ectomycorrhizal\nselectivity, are relatively common, but the underlying structure of\nthese patterns is usually unknown. We hypothesized that phylogenetic\ntrait conservation, one of the most commonly observed patterns in\necology, could play a key role in determining patterns of association in\nthe ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. We used the association between members\nof the pantropical plant tribe Pisonieae and members of the\n/tomentella-thelephora lineage as a model system to test the prediction\nthat Pisonieae-associating thelephoroids will be more closely related\nthan expected by chance, reflecting a conserved trait. We tested this\nprediction using previously published and newly generated ITS sequences\nin a Bayesian framework incorporating phylogenetic uncertainty. We\nreport that phylogenetic trait conservation does exist in this\nassociation, and that conservation of association is present at the\nlevel of the plant tribe, not at the generic level. We generated a\nfive-gene phylogeny of members of the Pisonieae, and used this phylogeny\nin a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis. We established that the\nmost recent common ancestors of Pisonieae species and\nPisonieae-associating thelephoroids sharing phylogenetic conservation of\ntheir patterns of ECM association occurred no more recently than 14.2\nmillion years ago. We therefore suggest that phylogenetic trait\nconservation in the Pisonieae-thelephoroid association represents an\ninherited syndrome which has existed for at least 14 million years.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE 17","ntax":"620","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76565.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE
