They occur on a wide range of hosts and have a worldwide\ndistribution. Although several species have in the past been reported\nfrom China, the vast majority are not known from culture or DNA\nphylogeny. The primary aim of the present study was thus to clarify the\ntaxonomy and phylogeny of a large collection of Cytospora species\nassociated with diverse hosts in China. Cytospora spp. were collected in\nnortheast, northwest, north and southwest China, indicating that the\ncold and dry environments favour these fungi. In this paper, we provide\nan assessment of 51 Cytospora spp., focussing on 38 species represented\nby 85 isolates from 28 host genera. Based on a combination of morphology\nand a six-locus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, act, rpb2, tef1-Î± and tub2), 13 new\nspecies and one new combination are introduced. The majority of the\nspecies investigated here appear to be host-specific, although further\ncollections and pathogenicity studies will be required to confirm this\nconclusion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119015.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119016.phy"}]}
