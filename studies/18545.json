Evolutionary analyses using the amplified\nfragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method were carried out on 133\nisolates from 19 countries. The AFLP data were complemented by sequence\nanalysis of three genes (ITS region of ribosomal RNA gene, phenolic acid\ndecarboxylase e Pheca I, and Cytochrome oxidaseeCox I), morphometric\nanalysis and cardinal temperature data. The high proportion of clonal\ngenotypes, low gene flow among groups, which was defined by the\nstructure analysis, and low Neis gene diversity confirms the homothallic\nlife cycle of the groups. On the other hand, the ITS, Cox I and Pheca I\nsequence data support occasional hybridization between species. The\nstructure K ¼ 5 grouping revealed two groups of hybrid origin (C2 and\nF). While the C2 group resembles P. \u0001 serendipita, the F group includes\nFinnish isolates characterized by high oogonial abortion rates and slow\ngrowth. The morphological characters routinely used in identification of\nPhytophthora species are not useful for delimitation of species from the\nP. cactorum complex. Therefore, we discuss the status of P. hedraiandra\nas a separate species. The epitypification of P. cactorum is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cactorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97562.phy"}]}
