New\nspecies Lopharia resupinata and L. sinensis are described and\nillustrated. Lopharia resupinata, from southeastern China, is closely\nrelated to L. ayresii, and L. sinensis, from northern China, is related\nto L. cinerascens and L. mirabilis. Lopharia mirabilis specimens from\ntemperate to tropical areas with varied hymenophore configurations all\ncluster together in a fully supported clade. Dendrodontia and\nFuscocerrena are shown to be synonyms of Dentocorticium, which is\nphylogenetically related to Lopharia. Four new combinations,\nDentocorticium bicolor, D. hyphopaxillosum, D. portoricense and D.\ntaiwanianum, are proposed. Revised generic descriptions of Lopharia and\nDentocorticium are provided with keys to the six accepted species in\neach genus. A list of all names in Lopharia and Dentocorticium are\npresented with their current taxonomic status. Type specimens of\nDentocorticium brasiliense and D. irregular were examined and determined\nto be later synonyms of Punctularia subhepatica and Diplomitoporus\ndaedaleiformis, respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107529","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107529.phy"}]}
