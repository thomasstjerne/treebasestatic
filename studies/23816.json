The family is\nresolved as a strongly supported clade that encompasses Pleuroascus and\nthe new anamorph genera Entimomentora and Venustampulla. The latter\nincludes V. parva, a species placed formerly in Scopulariopsis, and V.\nechinocandica, which is established for the echinocandin-producing\nisolate BP-5553. Entimomentora includes E. hyalina, a species based on\nthe ex-type strain of Ph. hyalina. Additional isolates identified as Ph.\nhyalina are distantly related to the Pleuroacaceae and include\nPsychrophila antarctica (Arachnopezizaceae) and Cryonesomyces\ndreyfussii, the sole member of the new genus, Cryonesomyces (incertae\nsedis). Isolates identified or deposited as Ph. alba are also not\nclosely related; they include a species for which we propose the name\nNeobulgaria koningiana (Gelatinodiscaceae) and a second psychrophilic\nspecies that we describe as Psychrophila lagodekhiensis. Of the thirteen\nisolates assessed for in vitro antifungal activity, only V.\nechinocandica inhibited the growth of Candida albicans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Leotiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119386.phy"}]}
