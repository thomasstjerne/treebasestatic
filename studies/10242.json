Description of the larva of a new species of Neothyridae, the\nfirst formal description for that instar for the entire suborder, does\nnot provide additional morphological data supporting the relationship.\nHowever, because the larva is holotrichous, it does allows the first\ndirect comparisons of setation patterns among immatures of all four\nparasitiform suborders. Analysis of sequence data for 4 loci, with\nrepresentation of all families of Holothyrida, provided strong evidence\nfor (1) monophyly of Holothyrida, (2) a close relationship of\nHolothyrida and Ixodida, and (3) a grouping of the “large bodied”\nParasitiformes, Opilioacarida, Holothyrida, and Ixodida, to the\nexclusion of Mesostigmata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 23","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holothyrids and Ticks, MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6759.phy"}]}
