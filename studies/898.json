Three of the five species, C. angustifolium, C.\npeninsulare and C. utahense, are transferred to Funastrum: F.\nangustifolium, F. peninsulare and F. utahense. The remaining two\nspecies, C. grisebachii and C. wrightianum are known from the type only\nand it is suggested to cite them as Cynanchum grisebachii and C.\nwrightianum until analyzable material becomes available.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 bottom","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seutera cpDNA + indels","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 top","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seutera cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5730.phy"}]}
