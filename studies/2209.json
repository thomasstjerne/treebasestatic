An isolate\noriginating from the basidioma produced conidia of P. glomerulata by\nsoaking culture in water. Three additional strains originating from\nconidia of P. glomerulata produced immature basidiomata with\nbasidium-like structures on the agar medium after about four months\nincubation. Fine structure of hyphal septa of P. glomerulata was found\nto be of the dolipore type. Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences\nfrom the D1/D2 regions of the LSU rDNA showed that the strains from\nconidia and from a basidioma clustered together in the Flagelloscypha\nclade and nested within the Nia clade of Hymenomycetes. The culture\nstudies and molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that P.\nglomerulata has a Flagelloscypha teleomorph, a cyphelloid basidiomycete.\nThe molecular data also indicates that P. glomerulata is\nphylogenetically related to the marine basidiomycetes, Nia and\nHalocyphina. Thus, this study revealed that cyphelloid basidiomycetes\nhave evolved both into marine as well as freshwater habitats by\nmorphological adaptations of the teleomorphs in the former and of the\nanamorph in the latter case.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5417.phy"}]}
