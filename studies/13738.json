As the result of\nobserved the morphological characteristics, this fungus was identified\nwith a species of the genus Botryosphaeria. However, as the result of\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis, this fungus was included in the clade\nof the genus Guignardia, therefor it was differed a result of the\nidentification by the morphological characteristics observation and the\nmolecules phylogenetic analysis. It is necessary to change the\nclassification criterion of both genera to establish the taxonomic\nposition of this fungus, however, recently it was supported by the\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis including the both genera and its\nrelated genera ware clearly divided into Botryosphaeria and Guignardia.\nTherefore, it was suggested that this fungus was more likely to a new\nspecies of Guignardia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"fig. 2","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59787.phy"},{"tree_label":"fig. 3","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59788.phy"},{"tree_label":"fig. 4","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59789.phy"}]}
