By revisiting previous\nstudies on multiple taxa, we investigate the biogeographic history of\nthe Indian Ocean by assessing the relationships among regions of\ndifferent geological origins, the possible paths that have connected\nthese regions, and the relative importance of oceanic dispersal and\ncontinental vicariance. We apply a Bayesian framework to multiple\npreviously published phylogenetic and phylogeographic datasets. All\nphylogenies are time-calibrated and have ancestral areas of distribution\ninferred through historical biogeographic methods. Transoceanic\ndispersal has predominantly shaped the current biogeographic\nconfiguration for these taxa, with a limited role for vicariance. The\neastern and western Indian Ocean provinces progressively became\nconnected and India, by receiving immigrants from multiple locations,\nhas served as an intermediary before its collision with Asia, which may\nexplain the lack of endemicity found there. The Indian Ocean is a major\nhighway for organisms, and its complex geological history has enabled\nmultiple biological routes over time. Long-term taxon exchange between\ncontinents, subcontinents and islands has been commonplace and\necological opportunities played a major role in the biogeographic\nshaping of the Indian Ocean.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124520.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124524.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124525.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124527.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124519.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124522.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124521.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124523.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124526.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124528","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124528.phy"}]}
