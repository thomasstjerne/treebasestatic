DNAs were digested with 21 restriction enzymes\nand hybridized with S. album cpDNA probes covering the entire genome. A\ntotal of 141 ingroup variable restriction sites was identified.\nMorphological variation was observed in a total of 66 characters. Both\ndatasets were analysed using parsimony methods and compared with\nevidence from cytology, artificial hybridization and biogeography to\ninfer evolutionary relationships. The results 1) indicate a relatively\nhigh level of nucleotide sequence divergence within S. ser. Rupestria;\n2) indicate three main lines of plastome differentiation, which are in\nagreement with morphology, basic chromosome numbers, and centres of\ndiversity; 3) do not provide a compelling solution for basal\nrelationships; 4) support an earlier hypothesis on reticulation and\nprovide evidence for a third case of allopolyploidy in the series; 5)\nsuggest that interspecific gene flow in S. ser. Rupestria is funnelled\nthrough the presumably allopolyploid S. rupestre subsp. erectum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4269.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B (I)","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4270.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B (II)","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4271.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B (III)","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4272.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sedum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4273.phy"}]}
