Although the differing isolating mechanisms of\nvicariance and rapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins have been\nproposed, a stable and robust phylogeny is unavailable. Results We used\na phylogenomic approach with mitochondrial and nuclear genes taking\nadvantage of the whole-genome sequencing of nine species in the group to\nestablish a stable (i.e. concordance in tree topology among multiple\nlies of evidence) and robust (i.e. high nodal support) phylogenetic\nhypothesis for the family Strongylocentrotidae. We generated eight draft\nmitochondrial genome assemblies and obtained 13 complete mitochondrial\ngenes for each species. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondrial\nsequences failed to provide a reliable phylogeny. In contrast, we\nobtained a very well-supported phylogeny from 2301 nuclear genes without\nevidence of positive Darwinian selection both from the majority of\nmost-likely gene trees and the concatenated fourfold degenerate sites:\n((P. depressus, (M. nudus, M. franciscanus), (H. pulcherrimus, (S.\npurpuratus, (S. fragilis, (S. pallidus, (S. droebachiensis, S.\nintermedius)). This phylogeny was consistent with a single invasion of\ndeep-water environments followed by a holarctic expansion by\nStrongylocentrotus. Divergence times for each species estimated with\nreference to the divergence times between the two major clades of the\ngroup suggest a correspondence in the timing with the opening of the\nBering Strait and the invasion of the holarctic regions. Conclusions\nNuclear genome data contains phylogenetic signal informative for\nunderstanding the evolutionary history of this group. However,\nmitochondrial genome data does not. Vicariance can explain major\npatterns observed in the phylogeny. Other isolating mechanisms are\nappropriate to explore in this system to help explain divergence\npatterns not well supported by vicariance, such as the effects of\nrapidly evolving gamete recognition proteins on isolating populations.\nOur findings of a stable and robust phylogeny, with the increase in\nmitochondrial and nuclear comparative genomic data, provide a system in\nwhich we can enhance our understanding of molecular evolution and\nadaptation in this group of sea urchins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"M4 ML 0","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88657","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88657.phy"},{"tree_label":"M4 MP PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88658","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88658.phy"},{"tree_label":"M4 con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88659","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88659.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4A MP PAUP 1+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88660","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88660.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4S MP PAUP 1+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88665","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88665.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4N ML 0","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88666","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88666.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4N MP PAUP 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88668","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88668.phy"},{"tree_label":"MA MP PAUP 1+","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88655","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88655.phy"},{"tree_label":"MA ML 0+","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strongylocentrotids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88654.phy"},{"tree_label":"MA con 50 majrule+","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88656","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88656.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4A con 50 majrule+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88661","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88661.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4S con 50 majrule+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88664","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88664.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4N con 50 majrule","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88667","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88667.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4A ML 0+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88662","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88662.phy"},{"tree_label":"N4S ML 0+","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88663","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88663.phy"}]}
