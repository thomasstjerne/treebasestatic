Ito & S. Imai) Singer and its\nallied species, are referred to as âmatsutakeâ worldwide, and are the\nmost economically important edible mushrooms in Japan. They are widely\ndistributed in the northern hemisphere and establish a unique\nectomycorrhizal relationship with conifer and broadleaf trees. To\nclarify relationships among T. matsutake and its allies, and to delimit\nphylogenetic species, we analysed multilocus datasets (ITS, megB1, tef,\nand gpd) using correctly identified samples. Phylogenetic analyses\nclearly identified four major groups; the âmatsutakeâ group, T.\nbakamatsutake, T. fulvocastaneum, and T. caligatum; the latter three\nspecies were outside the âmatsutakeâ group. The âmatsutakeâ group\nincluded four closely related but clearly distinct taxa (T. matsutake,\nT. anatolicum, Tricholoma sp. from Mexico, and T. magnivelare) from\ndifferent geographical regions; these were considered to be distinct\nphylogenetic species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1++","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90479.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2+","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Matutake","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90480.phy"}]}
