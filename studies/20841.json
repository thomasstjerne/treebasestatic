This work adds to the\nknowledge of the family, by introducing a new taxon from dead scales of\npine cones collected on the ground in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand.\nAnalysis of a combined LSU, SSU, RPB2 and TEF1 sequence dataset inferred\nthe distinct phylogenetic position of the taxon in Gloniaceae and\nPurpularium murispora gen. et sp. nov. is introduced to accommodate it.\nThe genus is characterized by erumpent to superficial, navicular\nhysterothecia, with a prominent longitudinal slit, branched\npseudoparaphyses in a gel matrix, with a purple pigmented epithecium,\nhyaline to dark brown muriform ascospores and a Psiloglonium\nstygium-like asexual morph which is produced in culture. The new taxon\nis illustrated and compared with similar genera and a new order is\nintroduced to accommodate the monotypic family Gloniaceae which now\ncomprises three genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103345","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103345.phy"}]}
