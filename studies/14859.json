The genus contains annual and perennial, endemic,\ncosmopolitan, wild, and invasive species with diploid, tetraploid, and\nhexaploid cytotypes. As such, Phalaris presents an ideal platform to\nstudy diversification via historic hybridization and polyploidy events,\nand geographic dispersal in grasses. We present the first empirical\nphylogeographic study for Phalaris testing current, intuitive hypotheses\non the centers of origin, historic dispersal events and diversification\nwithin a geological timeframe. Bayesian methods (BEAST v. 1.6.2) were\nused to establish divergence dates, and dispersal-vicariance analyses\n(RASP v. 2.1b) were implemented for ancestral node reconstructions. Our\nphylogeographic results indicate that the genus emerged during the\nMiocene epoch (20.6-8.4 MYA) in the Mediterranean Basin followed by\ndispersal and vicariance events to Africa, Asia and the Americas. We\npropose that a diploid ancestor of P. arundinacea migrated to western\nNorth America via the Bering Strait, where further diversification\nemerged in the New World. It appears that polyploidy played a major role\nin the evolution of the genus in the Old World, while diversification in\nthe New World followed a primarily diploid pathway. Dispersal to various\nparts of the Americas followed different routes. Fertile florets with\nhairy protruding sterile lemmas showed significant correlation with\nwider geographic distribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE
