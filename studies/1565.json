Results from the morphological\nanalysis correlate well with earlier hypotheses about the evolution of\nthe genus, showing a transition from tall, thin-leaved trees with large\ninflorescences to small trees with thick leaves and reduced\ninflorescences. While a basic phylogenetic signal is also discernible in\nthe AFLP analysis, it is partly eclipsed in that samples from different\nspecies sometimes cluster according to geographic proximity rather than\nsystematic affiliation. This structure is interpreted as indicative of\nfrequent hybridization and introgression.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2491.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2490.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2493.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2494.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2495.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2496.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2497.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2498.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2499.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2500.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2501.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2502.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2503.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2504.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2505.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2506.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polylepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2507.phy"}]}
