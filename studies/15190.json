We used this\nreconstruction to test the extent to which physical geography (e.g.,\nmountains and rivers) and habitat type (e.g., biomes) shaped patterns of\ndiversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69581","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69581.phy"}]}
