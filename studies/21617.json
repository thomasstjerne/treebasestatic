Intraspecific variation of symbionts remains\npoorly assessed while phenotypic effects and transmission behaviors,\nwhich are key processes for the persistence and evolution of symbioses,\nmay differ widely depending on the symbiont strains. Serratia symbiotica\nis one of the most frequent symbiont species in aphids and a valuable\nmodel to assess this intraspecific variation since it includes both\nfacultative and obligate symbiotic strains. Despite evidence that some\nfacultative S. symbiotica strains exhibit a free-living capacity, the\npresence of these strains in wild aphid populations, as well as in\ninsects with which they maintain regular contacts, has never been\nevidenced. Here, we examine the prevalence, diversity and tissue tropism\nof S. symbiotica in wild aphids and associated ants. We found a high\noccurrence of S. symbiotica infection in ant populations, especially\nwhen having tended infected aphid colonies. We also found that the S.\nsymbiotica diversity includes strains residing within the gut of aphids\nand ants. In the latter, this tissue tropism was found restricted to the\nproventriculus. Altogether, these findings highlight the extraordinary\ndiversity and versatility of an insect symbiont, and suggest the\nexistence of novel routes for symbiont acquisition in insects.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107247.phy"}]}
