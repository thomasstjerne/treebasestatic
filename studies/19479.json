A new genus Melanoctona was collected on decaying\nwood of Tectona grandis in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand and is\nintroduced in Herpotrichiellaceae. It has a unique combination of\nmorphological and phylogenetic characters. Phylogenetic analyses of\ncombined ITS, LSU and SSU sequence data place Melanoctona in a distinct\nlineage in Herpotrichiellaceae. Melanoctona is distinguished form other\ngenera in Herpotrichiellaceae by its hyphomycetous form and muriform,\nellipsoidal to ovoid, brown to dark brown conidia. Minimelanolocus\nyunnanensis sp. nov. is also introduced. This species inhabits decaying\nwood in freshwater streams and rivers in Yunnan Province, China. Maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of combined ITS, LSU\nand SSU sequence data, as well as a distinct morphology provide evidence\nfor this new species. Comprehensive descriptions and illustrations of\nMelanoctona tectonae gen. et sp. nov. and Minimelanolocus yunnanensis\nsp. nov. are provided with notes on their taxonomy and phylogeny.\nMinimelanolocus yunnanensis is compared with morphologically similar\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Herpotrichiellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110216.phy"}]}
