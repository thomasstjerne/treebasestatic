Distinction of the two new species\nis based on morphological variation and supported with phylogenetic\nanalyses of the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS region and part of the gene\nthat encodes for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2).\nThe phylogenies inferred recovered the two species in different clades\nstrongly supported by posterior probabilities and bootstrap values. The\nnew Lactarius species are recognized as part of the assemblage of\nectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Alnus acuminata in Mexico.\nInformation presented of these taxa includes the morphological variation\nachieved along sixteen monitories between 2010 and 2013. Descriptions,\naccompanied by photos including SEM photomicrographs of basidiospores\nand information on differences between them and other related taxa from\nEurope and the United States, including types, are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius species using ITS and RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_68837.phy"}]}
