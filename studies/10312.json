White\ncotton-like growth was found on the heads and fins of the fish. Hyphae\npenetrated into the dermal layers, subcutaneous tissues, muscular\nlayers, and cartilaginous tissue of the mandible and maxilla; these\nhyphae were associated with cellular debris and lesions in host tissue.\nWhite fluffy colonies from sub-cultures of these growths were isolated\non glucose-yeast (GY) agar plates with 0.5% sodium chloride (NaCl);\nthese isolates consisted of delicate, slightly wavy, and moderately\nbranched hyphae. Zoosporangia were isodemetric with the vegetative\nhyphae. Oogonia were abundant and approximately 21-33 Êm in diameter\nwith irregular short papillae; generally they were spherical or\nsubspherical and only rarely pyriform. Individual oogonia usually\ncontained a single oospore, which were spherical, and 19-27 Êm in\ndiameter with a large shiny vesicle. Antheridal branches, when present,\nwere usually androgynous, however they were sometimes monoclinous or\ndiclinous. The optimal growth temperature of the isolates was 20oC, and\ncultures grew well at low salinity (0-0.5% NaCl). Phylogenic analysis\nbased on the internal transcribed space 1-5.8S-ITS 2 of the ribosomal\nRNA gene (ITS rDNA) indicates that these isolates will be an\nas-yet-unidentified species of Aphanomyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphanomyces salsuginosus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6862.phy"}]}
