Morphological and phylogenetic analyses\nshowed the taxon to be Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. Pathogenicity\ntesting and Kochâs postulates proved that Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae\ncaused fruit peduncle and pedicel discolouration on grape fruit\nclusters. This is the first report of this fungus causing grapevine\nfruit peduncle and pedicel discolouration worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80571.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80572.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80569.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80570.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80574.phy"}]}
