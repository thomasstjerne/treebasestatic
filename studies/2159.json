Four of these collections\nhave been investigated by morphological and also molecular means where\npossible, and compared with similar species from the Southern\nHemisphere. Although some variation in character states is present, both\nsets of data confirm the presence of two separate, but closely related\nspecies Gymnopilus dilepis and Gymnopilus purpuratus both of which are\nalso found in Australia. Gymnopilus mullaunius from Australia is reduced\nto synonymy with Gymnopilus purpuratus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Purple-Coloured Gymnopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5314.phy"}]}
