This is one of two\n(possibly four) described extant species in the Ebridea, an enigmatic\ngroup of eukaryotes with an unclear phylogenetic position. Ebriids have\nnever been cultured, are usually encountered in low abundance and have a\npeculiar combination of ultrastructural characters including a large\nnucleus with permanently condensed chromosomes and an internal skeleton\ncomposed of siliceous rods. Consequently, the taxonomic history of the\ngroup has been tumultuous and has included a variety of affiliations,\nsuch as silicoflagellates, dinoflagellates, \u001aradiolarians\u001a and \u001aneomonads\u001a.\nToday, the Ebridea is treated as a eukaryotic taxon incertae sedis\nbecause no morphological or molecular features have been recognized that\ndefinitively relate ebriids with any other eukaryotic lineage. We\nconducted phylogenetic analyses of small subunit rDNA sequences from two\nmulti-specimen isolations of E. tripartita. The closest relatives to the\nsequences from E. tripartita are environmental sequences from a\nsubmarine caldera floor. This newly recognized Ebria clade was most\nclosely related to sequences from described species of Cryothecomonas\nand Protaspis. These molecular phylogenetic relationships were\nconsistent with current ultrastructural data from all three genera,\nleading to a robust placement of ebriids within the Cercozoa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ebriid phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2424.phy"}]}
