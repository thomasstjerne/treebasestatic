We conducted a phylogenetic\nanalysis using combined multigene sequence data from the rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer sequence and partial genes for calmodulin, histone\nH3, beta-tubulin, and translation elongation factor 1-alpha. The results\nindicate that D. toxicodendri occupies a monophyletic clade with high\nsupport. Although 10 species are phylogenetically closely related to D.\ntoxicodendri, morphological characteristics of size of alpha conidia and\nlacking of beta and gamma conidia support the distinction of this fungus\nfrom those closely related species. No sexual morphic structures have\nyet been found for the species. The pathogenicity of this species was\nconfirmed by the inoculation test to T. vernicifluum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Supplementary_Fig","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of comprehensive Diaporthe species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of closely related species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107562.phy"}]}
