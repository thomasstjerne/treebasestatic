In the current study, eight taxa of Botryosphaeriaceae were\nidentified as canker-associated fungi, pathogens, potential pathogens or\nendophytes of mangoes in the Kimberley, Australia. These include\nNeoscytalidium novaehollandiae, N. dimidiatum, Pseudofusicoccum\nadansoniae, P. ardesiacum, P. kimberleyense, Lasiodiplodia sp. 1,\nLasiodiplodia iraniensis and L. pseudotheobromae. The pathogenicity of a\nselection of these species toward fruit and branches was tested. All\nwere pathogenic to mango in comparison to the control, with\nLasiodiplodia spp. being the most pathogenic. It appears that either\ngeographic isolation or the unique growing conditions in the Kimberley\nmay have provided an effective barrier to the acquisition or\nestablishment of known botryosphaeriaceous pathogens. Wounds caused by\nmechanical pruning may provide an entry point for infection, whilst\nsevere pruning may increase plant stress","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS EF bootstrap","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31369.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31366.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF parsimony","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31370.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS bootstrap","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31367.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS EF parsimony","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31368.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF bootstrap","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae ex Mangifera indica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31371.phy"}]}
