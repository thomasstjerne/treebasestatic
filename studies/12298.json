The species forms a\nmonophyletic clade, basal to a larger lineage comprising species\noriginating mainly from temperate to Mediterranean areas of the northern\nhemisphere. The phylogenetic approach in Fomitiporia also revealed\nmultiple unnamed clades within the F. robusta complex in the southern\nUSA and northern Mexico, representing potential species. The status of\nthe F. robusta complex in North America is briefly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia phylogeny using combined sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 unrooted","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia phylogeny using combined sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50551.phy"}]}
