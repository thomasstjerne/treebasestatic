In most current models, the gamma distribution is used for\nthe rates-across-sites distributions and is implemented as an\nequal-probability discrete gamma. In this paper, we introduce discrete\ndistribution estimates with large numbers of equally spaced rate\ncategories allowing us to investigate the appropriateness of the gamma\nmodel. With large numbers of rate categories, these discrete estimates\nare flexible enough to approximate the shape of almost any distribution.\nLikelihood ratio statistic tests and a nonparametric bootstrap\nconfidence bound estimation procedure based on the discrete estimates\nare presented that can be used to test the fit of a parametric family.\nWe apply the methodology to several different protein data sets and find\nthat although the gamma model often provides a good parametric model for\nthis type of data, rate estimates from an equal-probability discrete\ngamma model with a small number of categories will tend to underestimate\nthe largest rates. In cases when the gamma model assumption is in doubt,\nrate estimates coming from the discrete rate distribution estimate with\na large number of rate categories provide a robust alternative to gamma\nestimates. An alternative implementation of the gamma distribution is\nproposed that, for equal numbers of rate categories, is computationally\nmore efficient during optimization than the standard gamma\nimplementation and can provide more accurate estimates of site\nrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mdh","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic MDH","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1219.phy"},{"tree_label":"HBS1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic HBS1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4187.phy"},{"tree_label":"hsp90","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic hsp90","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1220.phy"},{"tree_label":"Archaebacterial EF-1alpha","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaebacterial EF-1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4181.phy"},{"tree_label":"eRF3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic eRF3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4190.phy"},{"tree_label":"plantHMG","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plant HMG-CoA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4191.phy"},{"tree_label":"hsp70","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eubacterial hsp70","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4188.phy"},{"tree_label":"beta tubulin","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic beta-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4189.phy"},{"tree_label":"EukEF","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic EF-1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4185.phy"},{"tree_label":"ArchaeHMG","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaebacterial HMG-CoA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4182.phy"},{"tree_label":"BactHMG","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacterial HMG-CoA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4183.phy"},{"tree_label":"eukHMG","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryotic HMG-CoA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4186.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpn60","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaperonin 60","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4184.phy"}]}
