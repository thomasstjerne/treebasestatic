Results: Children 7 to 9 years of age\nin 2011 to 2012 who were part of the Ewha Birth & Growth Cohort\nStudy were recruited for this study. A total of 103 girls and 70 boys\nwere included in the analyses. Seven girls and 26 boys were identified\nto have precocious puberty. Among four single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) of MKRN3 and two SNPs of LIN28B examined, three SNPs (rs2239669,\nrs6576457, and rs12441827) showed significant associations with\nprecocious puberty in additive models in boys but no significance was\nfound in any SNPs in girls. From the logistic regression analysis, boys\nwith TT alleles in rs12441827 had about a four-times greater risk for\nprecocious puberty when compared to C allele carriers (OR = 3.95, 95% CI\n= 1.27 Â– 12.32 in model 1). eQTL analysis revealed that SNPs of\nstatistical significance from our study did not show the variation in\nexpression profiles nor found in the database. Conclusions: This study\nsupports the impact of MKRN3 SNP rs12441827 on precocious puberty in\nKorean boys. The results add a further aspect to genetic association in\nprecocious puberty along with complex interactions of environmental,\nnutritional and socioeconomic factors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 3 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112119.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 10 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112126.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 9 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112125.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 8 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112124.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 7 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112123.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 6 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112122.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 5 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 4 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 2 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 1 simulated by Coalescent Trees","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MKRN3 and LIN28B polymorphisms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112117.phy"}]}
