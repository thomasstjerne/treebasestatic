We focused our sampling on the lindsaeoids and\nassociated ferns in order to obtain a better understanding of the\ndiversification of the early polypods. However, the exact phylogenetic\nposition of Saccoloma and Cystodium remained uncertain. Based on relaxed\nmolecular clock analyses, it appears that the crown group lindsaeoids\ndiversified in the Caenozoic, more or less simultaneously with the main\nradiation of other Polypodiales, even though the original divergence\nbetween the lindsaeoid and non-lindsaeoid polypods occurred before the\nend of the Jurassic. The current pantropical distribution of lindsaeoids\ncan be explained by either long-distance dispersal across the oceans or\nvicariance caused by the retreat of previously widely distributed\ntropical forests from higher to lower latitudes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"atpA parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59017.phy"},{"tree_label":"noncoding parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59015.phy"},{"tree_label":"rps4 parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59022.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59023.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL parsimony","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59020.phy"},{"tree_label":"8 gene bayesian","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59025.phy"},{"tree_label":"7 gene bayesian","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59024.phy"},{"tree_label":"6 gene parsimony","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59013.phy"},{"tree_label":"7 gene calibrated","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59026.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59016.phy"},{"tree_label":"atpB parsimony","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59018.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpoC1 parsimony","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59021.phy"},{"tree_label":"psbA parsimony","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59019.phy"},{"tree_label":"8 gene parsimony","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindsaeoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59014.phy"}]}
