During the course of a nationwide monitoring program aimed\nat the detection of pathogens in commercial eucalypt plantations in\nPortugal, Q. eucalypti was found affecting Eucalyptus globulus. The\nidentity of the pathogen was confirmed by sequence analyses of the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA operon, as well as\nmorphological characteristics. Quambalaria eucalypti is widespread\nthroughout the eucalypt producing areas of Portugal. Pathogenicity\nstudies revealed that different host genotypes showed various degrees of\nsusceptibility to the pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first\nreport of Q. eucalypti on Eucalyptus spp. in Portugal and in the\nNorthern hemisphere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87164.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbour-Joining","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87165.phy"}]}
