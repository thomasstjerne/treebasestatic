This new taxon is distinguishable from other species\nbased on the following features: a crest formed by the premaxillae and\nnasals having a step-wise posterior end and bearing two longitudinal\ngrooves and numerous oblique striations on each of its lateral surfaces,\nan extremely elongate external naris that is posteriorly situated and\nclose to the orbit, a deep fossa on the dorsal surface of the palatal\nramus of th pterygoid, several longitudinal grooves along the posterior\npart of the dorsal margin of the dentary, and several tubercles along\nthe lateral shelf at the dorsal margin of the surangular. This new taxon\npossesses some palatal and mandibular features not seen in other\noviraptorids but similar to those in more basal oviraptorosaurs,\nsuggesting a relatively basal position for this taxon witin the\nOviraptoridae. This systematic hypothesis is supported by a numerical\ncladistic analysis. This discovery not only adds to the known diversity\nof Late Cretaceous oviraptoroids, but provides significant new\ninformation on the evolution of some oviraptoid features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"oviraptorosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55889.phy"}]}
