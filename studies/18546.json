However, the\ncurrent phylogeny is not yet well supported, and relationships among\nsubfamilies and tribes of Ranunculaceae remain an open question. Eight\nmolecular markers from the three genomes (nuclear, chloroplast and\nmitochondrial) were selected to investigate these relationships,\nincluding new markers for the family (two homologs of the nuclear\nCYCLOIDEA gene, the chloroplast gene ndhF, and the mitochondrial intron\nnad4-I1). The combination of multiple markers led to better resolution\nand higher support of phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies of\nRanunculaceae, and among tribes within subfamily Ranunculoideae. Our\nresults challenge the monophyly of Ranunculoideae as currently\ncircumscribed due to the position of tribe Adonideae (Ranunculoideae),\nsister to Thalictroideae. We suggest that Thalictroideae could be merged\nwith Ranunculoideae in an enlarged single subfamily.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92089.phy"}]}
