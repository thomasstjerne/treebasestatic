{"Authors":" Lisa M. Schultheis","Year":" 2001","Title":" Systematics of Downingia (Campanulaceae) based on molecular\nsequence data: implications for floral and chromosome evolution.","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 26","Issue":" 3","Pages":" 603-621","Keywords":"","DOI":" 10.1043/0363-6445-26.3.603","Abstract":" The genus Downingia (Campanulaceae) has been the subject\nof numerous biosystematic studies, yet little is known of the\nevolutionary relationships among the 13 currently recognized species.\nPhylogenetic analyses were undertaken in order to examine the available\nbiosystematic data in a phylogenetic framework. The genus is of\nparticular interest for its extensive chromosomal variation and for its\ndistribution in relatively new, but threatened, vernal pool habitats of\nwestern North America. Parsimony analyses of molecular sequence data\nfrom the nuclear 18S–26S rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)\nand the chloroplast 3’ trnK intron indicate Downingia is monophyletic.\nMonotypic Porterella is sister to Downingia. Additional close relatives\ninclude Legenere and Howellia. Two main clades emerge within Downingia,\nneither of which have been previously recognized using morphological\nfeatures. One of the two clades is homogenous in chromosome number (n =\n11), and the other heterogenous, with chromosome numbers of n = 6, 8, 9,\n10, 11, and 12. Reduced, presumably selfing floral forms appear to have\narisen at least twice. “Long anther tube” floral forms appear to have\narisen three times from “short anther tube” floral forms. The data\nsuggest that the current circumscriptions of some species, notably D.\nyina, need further examination.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_594.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_591.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_592.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 (PAUP 9)","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_600.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_593.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_589.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_590.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_596.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_597.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_598.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_601.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_602.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_603.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_604.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_605.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_606.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_607.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_608.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS, strict consensus","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3726.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 (PAUP 216)","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3727.phy"},{"tree_label":"cp+ITS, strict consensus","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3728.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 (PAUP 3)","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3729.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downingia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_599.phy"}]}
