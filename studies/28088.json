All strains were studied via a polyphasic approach combining\ncolony characteristics, morphology and phylogeny inferred from\nmulti-locus sequences, including the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS),\npartial sequences of the Î²-tubulin (tub2), actin (act), manganese\nsuperoxide dismutase 2 (sod2), DNA lyase 2 (apn2) genes, a 200-bp intron\nof the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and the\nintergenic spacer between the apn2 gene and the mat1 idiomorph\n(apn2/mat1). Six species were distinguished, including three new\nspecies, namely C. caspicum, C. sacchari, and C. persicum, and three\npreviously described species, C. cereale, C. nicholsonii and C.\nsublineola. Comprehensive morphological descriptions and illustrations\nare provided for all species. Furthermore, this study provided novel\ninsights into the distribution and host range of known species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ISAM tree","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ISAM tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_132004.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITAG tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITAG tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_132005.phy"}]}
