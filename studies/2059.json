In addition, the\ntwo usnic acid-containing Lepraria species, Lepraria usnica Sipman and\nLepraria coriensis (Hue) Sipman, were suspected to be conspecific by\nsome authors. We incorporate molecular sequence data from two\nindependent loci to test several hypotheses regarding the conspecificity\nand phylogenetic position of these two taxa. The two species do not form\na monophyletic clade, thereby rejecting conspecificity, but both fall\noutside Lepraria s. str. The placement of L. usnica in Pilocarpaceae is\nwell supported, while the familial placement of L. coriensis could not\nbe determined; the species clusters with taxa outside Lecanorales s.\nstr. This study further illustrates the polyphyly of the leprose growth\nform and also suggests that certain leprarioid lichens may represent\nsterile forms of otherwise well-known genera, such as Sporopodium in the\nPilocarpaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepraria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1054.phy"}]}
