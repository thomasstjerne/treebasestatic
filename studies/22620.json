They have\nannual to perennial, resupinate to effused-reflexed basidiocarps, a\ndimitic hyphal system, encrustations on generative hyphae, the presence\nof subulate hymenial setae originating from tramal hyphae, the presence\nof cystidioles and hyaline, thin-walled and smooth basidiospores. The\nindividual morphological characters of the new species and their related\nspecies are discussed. In the phylogenetic tree based on ITS + nLSU +\nRPB2 datasets confirmed three new species were nested within the\nFuscoporia ferrea complex, and formed three well-supported lineages\ndistinct from other species. A key to Chinese species of Fuscoporia is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuscoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112608.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuscoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112606.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuscoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112607.phy"}]}
