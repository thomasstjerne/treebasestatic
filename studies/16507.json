The New Zealand forget-me-nots (Myosotis, Boraginaceae)\ncomprise a lineage of over 40 closely-related but morphologically and\necologically diverse species whose evolutionary history and taxonomy are\nunclear. Myosotis is a high priority for systematic research in New\nZealand because a high proportion of these species are threatened, and\nmany have restricted geographic ranges and occupy very specific\nhabitats. Here, we investigated the relationships and age of Southern\nHemisphere forget-me-nots by performing phylogenetic, molecular dating\nand other analyses of DNA sequence data sets from representatives of\nnearly all described species. To this end, we used both chloroplast\n(atpI-atpH + rps16â“trnQ) and nuclear ribosomal (ITS + ETS) DNA\nsequences, as well as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs).\nOur analyses showed that genus Myosotis likely arose in the Northern\nHemisphere during the Miocene with the ancestor of the Southern\nHemisphere lineage arising in the Pleistocene and radiating shortly\nthereafter. The Southern Hemisphere Myosotis species have very low\nlevels of genetic divergence and their relationships are largely\nunresolved, likely due to a combination of recent radiation,\nhybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting. Our results are compared\nto those of similar studies on other New Zealand species radiations, and\nimplications for ongoing and future Myosotis taxonomic and evolutionary\nresearch are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Myos trnQ aptH 73 15Oct2014","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myosotis reduced chloroplast DNA 73 individuals\nSplitsTree NJ tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myos AFLP 77 2057 21Oct2014","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myosotis AFLP 77 individuals SplitsTree NJ tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78541.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myos ITS ETS 75 21Oct2014","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myosotis reduced nuclear DNA 75 individuals SplitsTree\nNJ tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78542.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myos trnQ aptH 102 29Oct2014","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myosotis chloroplast 102 individuals RAxML GTR+G ML\ntree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79301.phy"},{"tree_label":"Myos ITS ETS 161 29Oct2014","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myosotis nuclear DNA 161 individuals RAxML GTR+G+I ML\ntree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79300.phy"}]}
