Based on multiple loci\nDNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions,\nthe large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA\ngene (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene (tef1), the\nlargest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb1) and the second subunit of\nRNA polymerase II (rpb2), our phylogeny recognizes ten distantly related\nclades of Postia sensu lato. Four new genera, Amaropostia, Calcipostia,\nCystidiopostia and Fuscopostia, are established, nine new species,\nAmaropostia hainanensis, Cyanosporus fusiformis, C. microporus, C.\nmongolicus, C. piceicola, C. subhirsutus, C. tricolor, C. ungulatus and\nPostia sublowei, are identified. Illustrated descriptions of the new\ngenera and species are described. Identification keys to Postia and its\nrelated genera, as well as keys to the species of each genus are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100207","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100207.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100208","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100208.phy"}]}
