Generic relationships are molecularly well-resolved and confirm\nthe placement of Mastigolejeunea pancheri and the monotypic\nDendrolejeunea fruticosa in Thysananthus. Most morphological characters\ncurrently used to distinguish genera in Ptychanthoideae are homoplastic\naccording to ancestral state reconstruction. Molecular and phytochemical\ndata suggest the occurrence of polyphyletic species in Thysananthus and\nMastigolejeunea. Careful study of the polyphyletic taxa revealed\nmorphological differences between some of the intraspecific clades,\nwhich correlated with synonymized or novel species. Incongruence between\nplastid and ITS data in M. pancheri indicated the occurrence of a\nputative hybrid, the first one recorded in Lejeuneaceae and the first in\nliverworts inferred from phylogenetic data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47447.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47439.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47450.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47449.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstruction inferred from the combined\nchloroplast and ITS dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstruction inferred from the combined\nchloroplast and ITS dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47454.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47448.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstruction inferred from the combined\nchloroplast and ITS dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47455.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from the\nseparated chloroplast and ITS datasets","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47446.phy"}]}
