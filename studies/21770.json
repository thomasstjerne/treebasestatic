These isolates were\nclassified in four morphotype by morphological characters, shape of\nmonilioid cells and branch type of monilioid cell-chains. On the other\nhand, these isolates were classified in five clades by molecular\nphylogenetic analysis used by the rDNA 5.8S and D1/D2 region. The\nisolates that form four morphotypes and five clades were fitted.\nAdditionally, these five group were differed their physiological\ncharacters. Thus, E. repens and three new species, E. dendritica sp.\nnov., E. ellipsoidea sp. nov. and E. cumulopuntioides sp. nov. were\nrecognized in this study. This study built new definition of type of\nmonilioid cell-chain as taxonomical characters. And this study showed\nspecies diversity of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in the genus of Epulorhiza\nof S. sinensis var. amoena f. amoena, so far bereaved that was only one\nspecies E. repens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107751.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107753.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 2+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107754.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107752","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107752.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107755.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107761","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107761.phy"}]}
