So far, it includes\nonly four species, which have been found in association with plants, and\nvery little is known about their distribution and host preferences. In\nthis study, a Coniothyrium-like fungus isolated from sea water from the\nnorth of Portugal was characterised. Phylogenetic analysis, based on\nsequence data of the internal transcribed spacer and beta-tubulin loci,\nplaced this fungus within the genus Verrucoconiothyrium but clearly\ndistinct from the other known species. A novel species\nVerrucoconiothyriumambiguumsp. nov. is described and illustrated. The\ntaxonomic affiliation of the genus Verrucoconiothyrium at the family\nlevel was addressed through individual and combined gene genealogies.\nOur results show that the genus Verrucoconiothyrium is a member of the\nfamily Didymellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Verrucoconiothyrium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121025.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Verrucoconiothyrium Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121024.phy"}]}
