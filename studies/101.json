Some taxonomists still prefer the\nearlier classifications that included Strelitziaceae, Lowiaceae, and\nHeliconiaceae in Musaceae s.l., and Costaceae as a part of Zingiberaceae\ns.l. Attempts to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the order have\nbeen made by Lane, Tomlinson, and Dahlgren & Rasmussen. An original\nanalysis of the evolutionary relationships of the eight families of the\nZingiberales based on the principles of phylogenetic systematics is\npresented here. The most parsimonious topology is (Musaceae\n(Strelitziaceae (Lowiaceae (Heliconiaceae ((Zingiberaceae, Costaceae)\n(Cannaceae, Marantaceae)). The cladogram rejects the recognition of\nMusaceae s.l. as an evolutionary group. A new phylogenetic\nclassification based on the cladogram is proposed that recognizes eight\nfamilies, two superfamilies, and five suborders within the\nZingiberales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zingiberales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1360.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zingiberales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1361.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6C","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zingiberales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1362.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zingiberales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1371.phy"}]}
