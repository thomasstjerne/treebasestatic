The objective of our work was to test Old World Vigna for\nmonophyly and to study infrageneric relationships. A total of 72\nchloroplast DNA mutations was scored among 27 Vigna species,\nrepresenting six of the seven subgenera and 11 of the 13 Old World\nsections. Cladistic analysis of these data supports the monophyly of Old\nWorld Vigna, the only exception being V. frutescens of subg. Vigna,\nwhich fell within the New World Vigna clade. Subgenus Haydonia occupies\na basal position in the Old World Vigna clade and is paraphyletic.\nSubgenus Vigna is polyphyletic. Four Old World cpDNA clades are well\nresolved: 1) sects. Catiang (the cowpea section) and Reticulatae of\nsubg. Vigna together with subg. Plectotropis; 2) subg. Ceratotropis (the\nAsian beans); 3) sect. Vigna of subg. Vigna; and 4) sect. Macrodontae of\nsubg. Vigna. The cpDNA phylogeny of Old World Vigna is generally\nconsistent with previous studies. CpDNA results suggest that sects.\nCatiang and Reticulatae could be split from subg. Vigna and placed with\nsubg. Plectotropis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vigna","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1646.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vigna","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1647.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vigna","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1648.phy"}]}
