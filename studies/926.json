In this study, we assess the utility of rDNA noncoding fragments\nfrom the external transcribed spacer 1 (ETS 1f) and from the 5′ end of\nthe intergenic spacer (5’ IGSf) for reconstructing lower‐level\nrelationships in the Cyperaceae. Phylogenetic analyses using the genus\nUncinia (tribe Cariceae) as a model indicate that phylogenies inferred\nfrom ETS 1f and 5’ IGSf sequences are congruent with those derived from\nITS. Although ITS and ETS 1f sequences evolve at similar rates, 5’ IGSf\nsequences evolve ca. 1.3 times faster. The combined analysis of all\nthree regions (ca. 1414 bp) produced 3.6 times more informative\ncharacters than ITS and greater than 40 times more than trnT‐L and\ntrnL‐F spacer data. Trees derived from combined analyses were the most\nrobust and resolved. Infraspecific variation in the ETS 1f (0.0%–0.17%)\nand 5’ IGSf (0.0%) was extremely low, indicating that variation within\nspecies will not be a problem for phylogenetic analysis. Amplification\nexperiments indicate that ETS 1f primers are universal for the\nCyperaceae (ca. 5000 spp.) and Juncaceae (ca. 300 spp.), while 5’ IGSf\nprimers are limited to tribe Cariceae (ca. 2300 spp.). Phylogenetic\nanalyses suggest that sections Uncinia and Platyandrae are monophyletic\nbut that series circumscriptions are largely artificial. A significant\ntopological difference with key taxonomic and biogeographical\nimplications between ITS and combined analyses stresses the importance\nof using all three noncoding regions to infer lower‐level\nphylogenies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5.
