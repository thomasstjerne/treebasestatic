{"Authors":" Fredrik Pleijel, Per Sundberg, Jenny Eklof","Year":" 2007","Title":" Phylogeny of benthic Phyllodocidae (Polychaeta) based on\nmorphological and molecular data","Journal":" Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" A combined molecular (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, 16S rDNA and\nCOI) and morphological analysis of the benthic phyllodocids is presented\nfor the first time. Nineteen phyllodocids and two outgroup taxa are\nassessed using parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. We\ndemonstrate high degrees in homoplasy in the traditionally used\nmorphological phyllodocid characters, and show that all the three\ncurrent subfamilies Phyllodocinae, Eteoninae and Notophyllinae are\nnon-monophyletic. The genera Eulalia, Eumida, Protomystides,\nPseudomystides, Pterocirrus and Sige form a well-supported group, as\ndoes Mystides and Nereiphylla. Another clade with strong support\nincludes Eteone and Paranaitis, although with Eteone nested within a\nparaphyletic Paranaitis. The relationship between these two taxa\nindicate that the unusual arrangement of modified cirri on the first\nsegments in Eteone is due to a fusion of segment 1 and 2 where the cirri\nof segment 1 have been reduced. Eulalia is non-monophyletic and should\nbe split, minimally into two groups. Our results are ambiguous regarding\nthe ancestral phyllodocid condition of absence\u001apresence of median antenna\nor nuchal papilla and uniramous or biramous parapodia, but shows that\nthe absence of cirri on segment 3 (previously an apomorphy, for e.g.,\nMystides, Pseudomystides and Hesionura) is maximally homoplastic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COI
