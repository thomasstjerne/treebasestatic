A new sapeornithid bird, Shenshiornis primita gen. et sp. nov.,\nbased on an articulated skeleton from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group\nof western Liaoning, China, sheds new light on these issues.\nShenshiornis possesses a skull as primitive as or even more primitive\nthan that of Archaeopteryx and hind limbs modified for an improved\narboreal capability. A cladistic analysis shows that: 1) presence of a\ndiapsid skull is a plesiomorphy of the Aves and a kinetic skull evolved\nincrementally later in avian evolution; and 2) cursorial capability\nsignificantly weakens at the base of the Pygostylia due to a change in\nlocomotor system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sapeornithidae results","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sapeornithidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55670.phy"}]}
