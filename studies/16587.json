All Sporobolomyces species in this\nclass were grouped into four clades according to the analyses of the\ncombined three rDNA genes. Cystobasidiopsis and Ballistosporomyces are\nemended to accommodate the Cystobasidiopsis and sasicola clades. Teunia\ngen. nov. and Pseudosporobolomyces gen. nov. are proposed as two new\ngenera to contain the taxa in the ruber and subbrunneus clade. Three new\nspecies were also described here, namely Ballistosporomyces\nchangbaiensis sp nov., Ballistosporomyces tibetensis sp nov. and\nPseudosporobolomyces taiwanensis sp nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr79321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79321.phy"}]}
