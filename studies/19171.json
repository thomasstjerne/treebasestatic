The distribution of these\nfungi in soil can constrain the establishment and resulting spatial\narrangement of orchids at the local scale, but the actual extent of\noccurrence and spatial patterns of orchid mycorrhizal (OrM) fungi in\nsoil remain largely unknown. ● We addressed the fine-scale spatial\ndistribution of OrM fungi in two orchid-rich Mediterranean grasslands by\nmeans of high-throughput sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons, obtained\nfrom soil samples collected either directly beneath, or at a distance\nfrom, adult Anacamptis morio and Ophrys sphegodes plants. ● Like\nectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycobionts, OrM fungi (tulasnelloid,\nceratobasidioid, sebacinoid and pezizacean fungi) exhibited significant\nhorizontal spatial autocorrelation in soil. However, OrM fungal read\nnumbers did not correlate with distance from adult orchid plants, and\nseveral of these fungi were extremely sporadic or undetected even in the\nsoil samples hcontaining the orchid roots. ● The sporadic occurrence of\nmycobionts of grassland orchids in host-rich stands uestions the view of\nthese fungi as capable of sustained growth in soil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127525.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127517.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127527.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127516.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127515.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127526.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127518.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127529","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127529.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127519.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127520.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parasola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127528.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"224","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126985.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126984.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126986","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126987","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126988.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127227.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127228.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"261","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127225.phy"}]}
