These groups represent the Gnomoniaceae,\nMelanconidaceae, Valsaceae, Diaporthaceae and Togniniaceae. New groups\nrepresenting undescribed families have also emerged and they have been\nreferred to as the Schizoparme, Cryphonectria-Endothia and Harknessia\ncomplexes. In this study, we define the new family Cryphonectriaceae\n(Diaporthales) to accommodate genera in the Cryphonectria-Endothia\ncomplex. These genera can be distinguished from those in other families\nor undescribed groups of the Diaporthales, by the formation of orange\nstromatic tissue at some stage of their life cycle, and a purple color\nreaction in KOH and a yellow reaction in lactic acid associated with\npigments in the stromatic tissue or in culture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryphonectriaceae ITS/TUBULIN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2433.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryphonectriaceae LSU (28S)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2434.phy"}]}
