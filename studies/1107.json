The fungus forms\ntrue sclerotia on stems and leaves of its host, and apothecia arise\nsingly or gregarious on the surface of ripe sclerotia. The new fungus\nwas collected together with a conidiomatal anamorphic fungus that\noccurred on the same host. A putative teleomorph - anamorph-connection\nof the observed taxa was ruled out by sequence comparison of the nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer DNA sequences (ITS nrDNA). Based\non morphology and pathogenicity, the new fungus belongs in the family\nSclerotiniaceae, Helotiales, Ascomycota. A phylogenetic analysis of ITS\nnrDNA sequences from 26 taxa of the family Sclerotiniaceae was performed\nin order to conclude on the systematic position of the new fungus. The\nsmall tuberoid sclerotia, brownish subsessile to substipitate apothecia,\nfour-spored asci, ellipsoid to isthmoid ascospores, inability to grow on\nPDA culture media, and a number of ITS nrDNA sequence autapomorphies\ncharacterize and distinguish the fungus from other taxa of the\nSclerotiniaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sclerotiniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1696.phy"}]}
