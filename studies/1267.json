Species of the new genus produce\ninconspicuous, superficial or immersed, ostiolate, smooth, hyaline to\npale orange, perithecia with two-layered walls, hyaline, septate\nparaphyses, 8-spored unitunicate asci with a refractive J- apical\nannulus, and fusiform 3-7 septate ascospores. Phylogenetic analyses of\nalignments of large and small subunit rDNA sequences suggest a strongly\nsupported, close relationship among the three Conioscypha species\nsampled and Ascotaiwania and Carpoligna, but the family and order\nrelationships of this clade remain uncertain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conioscyphascus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4414.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conioscyphascus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4415.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conioscyphascus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4416.phy"}]}
