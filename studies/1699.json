The evolutionary\nsignificance of this morphology is difficult to interpret because the\nphylogenetic positions of many clavarioid fungi are still unknown. In\nthis study, we examined the phylogenetic diversity of the Clavariaceae\nsensu lato among Homobasidiomycetidae by adding partial nuclear large\nsubunit ribosomal DNA sequences from clavarioid and corticioid fungi to\na large euagaric dataset, and analyzing them both together and\nseparately. Our results confirm that the clavarioid morphology has\nevolved multiple times within the euagarics, and that these may be\nreduced fruitbody types that have been repeatedly derived from agaricoid\nor corticioid ancestors. In some cases it was difficult to determine\nphylogenetic affinities of certain taxa due to ambiguous or dubious\nidentifications of sequences downloaded from GenBank, while in other\ncases our results were more clear. We propose the new genus Alloclavaria\nto accommodate Clavaria purpurea, which is not related to Clavaria, but\nis derived within the hymenochaetoid clade. The Clavariaceae needs\nredefinition to reflect a monophyletic group and the limits of Clavaria,\nClavulinopsis, and Ramariopsis should be reconsidered when additional\ndata are available.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Macrotyphula MP","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4738.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae, Chaetotyphula Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chaetotyphula MP","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clavaria Clade MP","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae, Clavaria Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4739.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae, Physalacriaceae Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4736.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae, Macrotyphula Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4737.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4733.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae, Hymenochaetoid Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4729.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP7","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4730.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP6","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hymenochaetoid MP5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4732.phy"},{"tree_label":"Physalacriaceae Clade MP2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_332.phy"},{"tree_label":"Physalacriaceae Clade MP1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_333.phy"}]}
