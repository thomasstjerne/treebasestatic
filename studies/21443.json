This can reveal whether new genes\narose on particular evolutionary lineages and were recruited for new\nfunctional roles. Here, we apply MCL clustering with all-vs-all\nreciprocal BLASTP to identify and phylogenetically date ‘Homology\nGroups’ amongst vertebrate proteins. Homology Groups include new genes\nand highly divergent duplicate genes. Focussing on the origin of the\nplacental mammals within the Eutheria, we identify 357 novel Homology\nGroups that arose on the stem lineage of Placentalia, 87 of which are\ndeduced to play core roles in mammalian biology as judged by extensive\nretention in evolution. We find the human homologues of novel eutherian\ngenes are enriched for expression in preimplantation embryo, brain, and\ntestes, and enriched for functions in keratinization, reproductive\ndevelopment, and the immune system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree built using representative proteins\nfrom Novel Core Placental Homology Groups","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106399.phy"}]}
