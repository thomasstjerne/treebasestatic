The\nasexual morph has ceratosporium-like conidia arising from aerial hyphae,\nwith a single arm and are usually attached or with 23 arms, brown, often\nwith a subglobose to conical cell at the point of attachment. A\ncomprehensive morphology and phylogeny of combined\nLSU-ITS-RPB2-β-tubulin dataset via maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses indicated that these three collections were new to science.\nTherefore, Iodosphaeria chiayiensis sp. nov. (sexual morph), I.\nthailandica sp. nov. (sexual morph) and I. jinghongensis sp. nov.\n(asexual morph) are introduced in this study. Iodosphaeria chiayiensis\nhas small, hyaline and ellipsoidal to allantoid ascospores, while I.\nthailandica has large ascomata, cylindrical to allantoid asci and\nhyaline to pale brown ascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133795.phy"}]}
