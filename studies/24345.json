Shiraia\nbambusicola and a new genus Rabershiraia gen. nov. typified by R.\nbambusae are treated in this study. The maximum likelihood phylogenic\nanalysis, generated from RAxML (GTR+G model) based on combined SSU, LSU,\nTEF1 and RPB2 sequences data shows that the new genus Rabershiraia\ncloses to Shiraia and belongs to family Shiraiaceae. Their descriptions\nand illustrations are provided. Morphological differences between the\ngenera of Shiraiaceae are discussed. A key to Shiraiaceae is provided.\nThe ascostromatal metabolites Hypocrellin A and Hypocrellin B, are\nexamined by HPLC. The content of hypocrellin in the new species\nRabershiraia bambusae is twice than that of Shiraia bambusicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117066.phy"}]}
