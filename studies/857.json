This conclusion is based on the comparison of\nmorphological and molecular data from four isolates of T. virens and a\nsingle collection and isolate of H. virens. Data for several\nmorphological characters, including colony and growth characteristics,\nwere collected. In addition, sequence data from ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 rDNA\nand translation elongation factor (tef-1É\u001a) were analyzed for the five\nisolates. Analysis of phenotypic characters show that cultures and\nmicroscopic characters of the anamorph of H. virens are\nindistinguishable from those of T. virens. This is consistent with\nsequence data from ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 rDNA which show that the sequence of\nH. virens is identical to that of the ex-type isolate of T. virens.\nDespite minor in tef-1É\u001a sequences, T. virens isolates and H. virens form\na monophyletic group that is different from other examined species of\nHypocrea; this clade is supported by a 100% bootstrap value. Molecular\nand morphological data confirm the connection between H. virens and T.\nvirens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma virens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma virens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3993.phy"}]}
