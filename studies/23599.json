Citrus melanose disease is\nthe major fungal disease of Nanfengmiju. It dramatically reduces the\ncommercial value of citrus production. Diaporthe spp. (synonym Phomopsis\nspp.) are the causal agents of this disease. Until now, 22 Diaporthe\nspecies have been identified on citrus in the world. The identification\nof Diaporthe species is the basis of the epidemiology, quarantine\nmeasure and management of this fungal disease. A melanose disease was\nfound on Nanfengmiju fruit in Jiangxi province of China in 2016. Three\nisolates from diseased samples were identified as Diaporthe\npassifloricola based on morphological characterization and multi-locus\nphylogenetic analyses. The pathogenicity of the three isolates was\nconfirmed on citrus fruit and the same isolates were re-isolated from\nthe diseased inoculated fruit. This is the first report of citrus\nmelanose diseases caused by D. passifloricola in China. The results\nexpand the known host range of D. passifloricola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114792.phy"}]}
