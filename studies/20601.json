In this study, we studied the genus Oropogon in one of the\nlargest families of lichen-forming ascomycetesParmeliaceae and performed\ndivergence times estimation on a multilocus species-tree using ITS\nsubstitution rate to investigate 1) the ancestral area of Oropogon, 2)\nthe times of diversification of major clades within Oropogon, and 3)\nidentify factors that affected the distribution and evolution of this\ngenus. The results indicate that ancestral area of Oropogon is either\nwidespread with subsequent separate evolution of clades in Asia and\nAmerica or in the New World (America) with subsequent migration to Asia.\nOur results suggest that the genus originally radiated during the early\nMiocene, with subsequent diversification events occurring during the\nmiddle Miocene. We hypothesize that the Mi-1 glaciation had impact on\nthe origin of the genus Oropogon, and that the rise of major mountain\nranges, such as the Himalayas, resulted in an acceleration of the\ndiversification rate in Oropogon in the Old World.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oropogon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106646.phy"}]}
