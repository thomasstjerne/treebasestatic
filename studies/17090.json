Here, we attempt to elucidate the historical\nbiogeography and the main triggers of taxonomic diversification within a\ngroup of ants. We find evidence that faunal interchange between Asia and\nAustralia, via Wallacea, was an old zoogeographic event, occurring at\nleast 2015 Ma. Moreover, early cladogenesis events of extant New Guinean\nspecies most likely occurred along the northern part of the island.\nDispersal to the Fiji Basin happened during the early and middle\nMiocene, in agreement with the subaerial Vitiaz Arc hypothesis. Finally,\ntwo diversification models were the most probable scenarios for the\nevolution of the group, the first one suggesting a one-process model\nwith overall increasing speciation at about 6 Ma, and the second model\nfavouring a rate shift in a clade consisting of geographically expanding\ntaxa which had a shift in habitat preference. Altogether, ancient\ndispersal conduits were important for the colonization of Pacific\narchipelagos, although the rapid orogenesis in New Guinea, and possibly\na subsequent ecological shift, triggered the taxonomic diversification\nof these insects.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Calibrated_ExonsIntrons_Yule_SoftConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85428","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85428.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_ExonsIntrons_BirthDeath_HardConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85425","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85425.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_ExonsIntrons_BirthDeath_SoftConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85426","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85426.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_Exons_BirthDeath_HardConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nylanderia Calibrated Exons BirthDeath\nHardConstraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85421.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_Exons_BirthDeath_SoftConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nylanderia Calibrated Exons BirthDeath\nSoftConstraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85422.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_Exons_Yule_HardConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nylanderia Calibrated Exons Yule HardConstraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear_Genes_Phylogeny","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nylanderia Nuclear Genes Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85439.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_Exons_Yule_SoftConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85424","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_ExonsIntrons_Yule_HardConstraint","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85427","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85427.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calibrated_COI_Mutation_Rate","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nylanderia Calibrated COI Mutation Rate","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85434.phy"}]}
