It is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate\nbasidiocarps with distinct white rhizomorphs, a monomitic hyphal\nstructure with non-amyloid, non-dextrinoid and cyanophilous generative\nhyphae, absence of gloeoplerous hyphae and gloeocystidia, presence of\ncystidia and cystidioles, and rough basidiospores (3.54 × 2.63 µm). A\nmolecular study based on the combined ITS (internal transcribed spacer\nregion) and nLSU (the large nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit) dataset\nsupports the new species in Dentipellis. A key to accepted species of\nDentipellis is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dentipellis rhizomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110256.phy"}]}
