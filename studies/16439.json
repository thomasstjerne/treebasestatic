Cryptic speciation\nand phenotypic heterogeneity were previously reported within W. sebi.\nUsing multi-locus sequence analysis, a companion study, focusing on\nWallemia in the indoor environment, found four phylogenetic species\nwithin the Wallemia sebi species complex (WSSC). In this study, we used\nthis established phylogenetic species hypothesis to guide phenotypic\nassessment of Wallemia sebi from diverse environments and undertook the\nformal taxonomic process of describing new species. To reaffirm the\nfindings of the companion study and because of the wider ecological\nrange of W. sebi isolates used here, we again performed phylogenetic\nanalysis using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and partial\nprotein-encoding gene sequences of DNA replication licensing factor\n(MCM7), pre-rRNA processing protein (TSR1), RNA polymerase II largest\nsubunit (RPB1), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) and a\nnew genetic marker 3´-phosphoadenosine-5´-phosphatase (HAL2). We also\nassessed phenotypes by observing culture and micromorphological\ncharacters, xerotolerance, halotolerance, chaotolerance, growth\ntemperature regimes, extracellular enzyme activities profiling, and\nsecondary metabolite patterns. Based on the phenotypic observations of\n≥100 strains, the Wallemia sebi species complex can be taxonomically\nrefined to four species, of which three are newly described here as\nWallemia mellicola sp. nov., W. canadensis sp. nov. and W. tropicalis\nsp. nov. A key to all of the proposed Wallemia species is provided,\nwhich allowing their identification with physiological,\nmicromorphological and culture characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi MCM7 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78032.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi RPB1 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78033.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi HAL2 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78025.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi ITS Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78031.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi RPB2 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78034.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia sebi Combined Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78036.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TSR1 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78035.phy"}]}
