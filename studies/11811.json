Our study examined ~32kb of\naligned nuclear DNA sequences from 19 independent loci for 169 species\nrepresenting all major extant groups and recovered a robust phylogeny\nfrom genome-wide signal supported by multiple analytical methods. We\ndocumented well-supported, novel interordinal relationships, such as a\nsister relationship between passerines and parrots, and corroborated\npreviously contentious groupings, such as flamingos and grebes. Our\nconclusions challenge current classifications and alter our\nunderstanding of trait evolution, for example, some diurnal birds\nevolved from nocturnal ancestors. Our results provide a valuable\nresource for phylogenetic and comparative studies in birds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenomic study of Birds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47831.phy"}]}
