Molecular data (partial SSU, LSU and\ncomplete ITS nrDNA) confirm mitosporic state of Hyphodermella rosae as\nthe causal agent of dry fruit rot of plum (Prunus domestica) and peach\n(Prunus persica) from Mazandaran, Iran. The asexual state of H. rosae is\ncharacterized by the presence of unicellular, spherical mitospores,\nwhich are terminal or intercalary in position. Both basidia and\nmitospores were observed in the matured cultures of H. rosae, although\nwe did not observe any basidiospores. The phylogeny of Phanerochaetaceae\nconfirms Hyphodermella as a monophyletic lineage within the family and\nsister group to Phanerochaete with considerable bootstrap support. Both\nthe isolates of mitosporic H. rosae, nest within a clade, which includes\nits sexual counterpart. Hence, we conclude that the lifecycle of H.\nrosae includes at least two reproductive states, i.e.Â sexual and\nasexual. Mitosporic H. rosae is capable of infecting plants and produce\nsimilar disease symptoms as its sexual state.","trees":[{"tree_label":"fig","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphodermella rosae Concatenated LSU SSU ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77472.phy"}]}
