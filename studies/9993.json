This study is based on data from morphology,\npalynology, and seed micromorphology (127 structural characters), and\nDNA sequences (matK, trnL intron, and ITS). Phylogenetic reconstructions\nbased on ITS and morphology provided the greatest resolution,\nmorphological data further helping to tentatively place several taxa for\nwhich DNA was not available (Celiantha, Lagenanthus, Rogersonanthus,\nRoraimaea, Senaea, Sipapoantha, Zonanthus). Celiantha, Prepusa and\nSenaea together appear as the sister clade to the rest of Helieae. The\nremainder of Helieae, which is largely divided into two large subclades,\nthe Macrocarpaea subclade and the Symbolanthus subclade. The first\nsubclade includes Macrocarpaea, sister to Chorisepalum, Tachia, and\nZonanthus. Irlbachia and Neblinantha are placed as sisters to the\nSymbolanthus subclade, which includes Aripuana, Calolisianthus,\nChelonanthus, Helia, Lagenanthus, Lehmanniella, Purdieanthus,\nRogersonanthus, Roraimaea, Sipapoantha, and Symbolanthus. Generic-level\npolyphyly is detected in Chelonanthus and Irlbachia. Evolution of\nmorphological characters is discussed, and new pollen and seed\ncharacters are evaluated for the first time in a combined\nmorphological-molecular phylogenetic analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Helieae, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Helieae, large combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Helieae, morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Helieae, small combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6453.phy"}]}
