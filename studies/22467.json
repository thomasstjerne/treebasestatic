A novel species,\nNeocosmospora perseae sp. nov. is described isolated from trunk lesions\non Persea americana in the main avocado producing area of Sicily, Italy.\nThe new species is characterised using a polyphasic approach including\nmorphological characters and a multilocus molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis based on partial sequences of the translation elongation\nfactor-1α, the internal transcribed spacer regions plus the large\nsubunit of the rDNA cistron, and the RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit. Pathogenicity testing and the fulfilment of Kochs postulates\nconfirm this species as a novel canker agent in Persea americana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"363","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocosmospora perseae TEF+rDNA+RPB2 A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocosmospora perseae TEF+ITS+LSU+RPB2 B","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112098.phy"}]}
