In particular, multiple, replicated cases of\ngeographic trait divergence present a powerful approach to study how\npatterns of introgression and adaptive divergence can vary with\ngeographic space and time. In this study, we conduct replicated,\nfine-scaled molecular genetic analyses of striking geographic dewlap\ncolor variation of a Hispaniolan Anolis lizard, Anolis distichus, to\ninvestigate whether adaptive trait divergence is consistently associated\nwith speciation, whereby genetic divergence is observed with neutral\nmarkers, or whether locally adapted traits are maintained in the face of\ncontinued gene flow.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1279","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anolis distichus mtDNA MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100300.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"1279","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anolis distichus mtDNA RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100299.phy"}]}
