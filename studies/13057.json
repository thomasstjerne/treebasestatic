Findings of Mesozoic\nbirds in Russia are extremely rare. Here we describe a new bird from the\nLower Cretaceous (BarremianÂ–Aptian, Ilekskaya Svita) Shestakovo-1\nlocality (southern Western Siberia, Russia), that has also yielded\ndinosaurs,mammals, crocodiles, pterosaurs and lizards. Mystiornis cyrili\ngen. et sp. nov. is based on an isolated metatarsus which displays a\nmosaic of morphological features allowing us to create a new order,\nMystiornithiformes. Mystiornis has a fully consolidated\n(ornithurine-like) gracile metatarsus with a primitive coplanar\narrangement of the metatarsals, three separate proximal articular\nfacets, and a uniquely located distal interosseal canal. It also\ndisplays diving adaptations previously documented only in\nOrnithurae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55331","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55331.phy"}]}
