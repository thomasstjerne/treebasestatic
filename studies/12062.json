Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is\nnon-phytopathogenic and taxonomically closely related to Xanthomonas,\nhas undergone several classifications from Pseudomonas to Xanthomonas\nand finally to Stenotrophomonas. In this study, we have investigated the\nphylogenetic and taxonomic status of these members using the complete\nRNA polymerase beta-subunit (rpoB) gene sequences available from their\nsequenced genomes. Not only did we obtain a phylogenetic tree for\nxanthomonads, but rpoB gene sequence information has also resolved the\ntaxonomic relationship of X. axonopodis pathovars, X. albilineans and\nother Xanthomonas strains, with the most marked evidence being that\nStenotrophomonas is synonymous to Xanthomonas. This study has revealed\nthe power and potential of complete rpoB gene sequence in taxonomic,\nphylogenetic and evolutionary studies on Xanthomonas and\nStenotrophomonas generic complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas\nstrains based on the complete rpoB gene sequence","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49292.phy"}]}
