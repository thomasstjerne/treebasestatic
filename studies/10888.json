These two species have been confused\nand treated as a single species (i.e. S. seminudus). However recent\nstudies based on population genetics have implied that they are\nreproductively isolated. In the present study we found that they are\nphylogenetically and morphologically distinct. The molecular\nphylogenetic trees inferred from the partial sequences of the largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and the second-largest subunit of\nRNA polymerase II (RPB2) support the differentiation of these two\nspecies as well as their differentiation from other related species.\nStrobilomyces seminudus is characterized by a stipe with an annular\nzone, becoming distinctly thickened near the apex and mottled with\nappressed-tomentose scales near the base. In contrast S. hongoi is\ncharacterized by a stipe with a remarkable reticulum at the upper and\nmiddle part and with minutely warty scales downward. Stipe\ncharacteristics also are useful for distinguishing these two species\nfrom other related species. In addition the incompletely reticulated\nbasidiospores of these two species are also distinct from those of\nrelated species (i.e. S. foveatus).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22304.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22299.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22313","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22313.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22314","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22314.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22315","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22315.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22308","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22308.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22307","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22307.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22305","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22305.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22312","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22312.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22311","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22311.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22321.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22298","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22298.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22310","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22310.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22300.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22302.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22306.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22295","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22295.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22301.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22293","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22293.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22309","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22309.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22303.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22297","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22297.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22294","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22294.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22319.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22318.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr22296","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_22296.phy"}]}
