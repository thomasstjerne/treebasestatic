The new species are supported by morphological\ncharacteristics and phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU and tef-1α). The new\nspecies have very similar morphological characteristics and are 98%\nsimilar in their ITS region. However, T. rugocephala has two types of\nlong gills at the same time, rarely fusiform pleurocystidia with\nrostrum. Detailed descriptions, colour photos, illustrations and a key\nto related species are presented in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130673","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130673.phy"}]}
