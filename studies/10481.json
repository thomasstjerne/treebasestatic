The genus has\nbeen characterized by the nature of the spores: thick-walled, smooth or\nornamented, and cyanophilous. Nine new ITS nrDNA sequences from species\nof this genus were aligned with 32 sequences obtained from GenBank, and\nphylogenetic analyses were performed. Six clades were determined within\nthe genus: one contains taxa with smooth spores and the other three with\nornamented spores. Hypochnicium versatum must be included in\nGloeohypochnicium and the new combination Gloeohypochnicium versatum is\nproposed. Two new species, Hypochnicium michelii from Spain and\nHypochnicium guineensis from Equatorial Guinea, are described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochnicium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9027.phy"}]}
