DNA sequencing of the chloroplast rbcL gene for\nrepresentatives of all 16 families and several putative relatives, with\nphylogenetic analyses by parsimony and maximum likelihood methods,\ndemonstrated instead a single major clade of mustard-oil plants and one\nphylogenetic outlier. In a further independent test, DNA sequencing of\nthe nuclear 18S ribosomal RNA gene for all these exemplars has yielded\nthe same result, a major mustard-oil clade of 15 families (Akaniaceae,\nBataceae, Brassicaceae, Bretschneideraceae, Capparaceae, Caricaceae,\nGyrostemonaceae, Koeberliniaceae, Limnanthaceae, Moringaceae,\nPentadiplandraceae, Resedaceae, Salvadoraceae, Tovariaceae, and\nTropaeolaceae) and one outlier, the genus Drypetes, traditionally placed\nin Euphorbiaceae. Concatenating the two gene sequences (for a total of\n3254 nucleotides) in a data set for 33 taxa, we obtain robust support\nfor this finding of parallel origins of glucosinolate biosynthesis. From\nlikely cyanogenic ancestors, the mustard oil bomb was invented\ntwice.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mustard oil (four of four)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3667.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mustard oil (three of four)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3668.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mustard oil (two of four)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3669.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"mustard oil tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3670.phy"}]}
