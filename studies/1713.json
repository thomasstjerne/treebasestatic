These processes are usually\ninferred from the patterns and distribution of genetic variation, with\nthe potential pitfall that different historical processes may result in\nsimilar genetic patterns. Using a combination of DNA sequence data from\nthe plastid genome, AFLP fingerprinting, and rigorous phylogenetic and\ncoalescence-based hypothesis testing, we show that Androsace halleri\n(currently distributed disjunctly in the NW\u001aIberian Cordillera\nCantabrica, the eastern Pyrenees, and the French Massif Central and\nVosges), or its ancestor, was once more widely distributed in the\nPyrenees. While there, it hybridised with A. laggeri and A. pyrenaica,\nboth of which are currently allopatric with A. halleri. The common\nancestor of A. halleri and the north Iberian local endemic A. rioxana\nprobably existed in the north Iberian mountain ranges with subsequent\nrange expansion (to the French mountain ranges of the Massif Central and\nthe Vosges) and allopatric speciation (A. rioxana, A. halleri in the\neastern Pyrenees, A. halleri elsewhere). We have thus been able to use\nthe reticulate evolution in this species group to help elucidate its\nphylogeographic history, including evidence of range contraction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace halleri Complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4747.phy"}]}
