In our study, Bimuria omanensis, a novel species\nwas isolated from unidentified decaying leaves in Oman. The phylogenetic\nplacement of B. omanensis is resolved based on maximum likelihood,\nmaximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of combined LSU, ITS and TEF1-Î±\nsequence data of Didymosphaeriaceae. The placement of Bimuria omanensis\nas a distinct species, is confirmed based on phylogeny. This is the\nfirst record of an asexual morph in Bimuria and first record of a\nBimuria species from Oman. The relationship of this taxa with other\nphylogenetically closely related Didymosphaeriaceae species is\nshown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bimuria LSU TEF ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124894.phy"}]}
