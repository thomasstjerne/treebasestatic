Maximum likelihood analysis was conducted with ITS\nsequences to generate a phylogenetic tree with better resolution,\nconfirming the occurrence of P. albidus, P. djamor, P. fuscosquamulosus,\nP. pulmonarius, and P. rickii in Brazil. In addition, we present a list\nincluding all epithets recorded from Brazil and an update of their\ntaxonomic status.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurotus sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64802.phy"}]}
