Phylogenetic relationships within seven\nlineages of birds were analyzed by numerical cladistic techniques\napplied to data sets of morphological characters. These relationships\nrevealed extensive congruence among the spatial and temporal histories\nof lineages whose species are endemic to common areas of endemism. A\ngeneral hypothesis is constructed to explain this- congruence in which\nwidespread biotas are postulated to have been partitioned into areas of\nendemism by the origin of geomorphological and/or ecological-climatic\nbarriers. Congruence in these phylogenetic patterns of differentiation\nsuggests the following historical pattern of interrelationships for\nareas of endemism along the northern and eastern coasts of Australia:\n(Kimberley Plateau + Arnhem Land) + ([New Guinea + Cape York Peninsula]\n+ [Atherton Plateau + Eastern Coastal Rainforest]). Likewise, this study\nindicates that the arid interior avifauna was segregated into two\nclosely related biotas (Eastern and Western Desert biotas) by the Eyrean\nBarrier. These biotas are, in turn, related to a more mesic avifauna\nthat was itself subdivided into areas of endemism located in the\nSouthwest and Southeast corners of the continent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malurus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_190.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ptiloris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_274.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrophasa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tregellasia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1452.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psophodes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1453.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poephila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1450.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipiturus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1458.phy"}]}
