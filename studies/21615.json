We assessed the\npotential of mating type (MAT) genes sequences as phylogenetic markers\nfor species delimitation in the genus Diplodia. A PCR-based mating type\ndiagnostic assay was developed that allowed amplifying and sequencing\nMAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes, and determining the mating strategies used\nby different species. All species tested were shown to be heterothallic.\nPhylogenetic analyses were performed on both MAT genes and also, for\ncomparative purposes, on combined sequences of the ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha\n(tef1-alpha) and beta-tubulin (tub2). MAT genes individual phylogenies\nclearly differentiated all species analysed and are in agreement with\nthe results obtained with the commonly used multilocus phylogenetic\nanalysis approach. However, MAT genes genealogies were superior to\nmultigene genealogies in resolving closely related cryptic species. The\nphylogenetic informativeness of each locus was evaluated revealing that\nMAT genes were the most informative locus followed by tef1-alpha. Hence,\nMAT genes can be successfully used to establish species boundaries in\nthe genus Diplodia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107242","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107242.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107240","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia corticola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107243.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107239","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107239.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia corticola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107241","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107244","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107244.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107245.phy"}]}
