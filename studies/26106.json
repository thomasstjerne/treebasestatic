Echinoderma\nflavidoasperum and Lepiota omninoflava are new to science, while Lepiota\nechinacea is new to China. Echinoderma flavidoasperum is characterized\nby a yellow pileus, nearly smooth stipe changing to light red when\nbruised, and subcylindrical basidiospores. Lepiota omninoflava is\ncharacterized by overall yellow basidiomata, ellipsoid basidiospores,\nabsence of cheilocystidia, and has been found only in tropics. Based on\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the large subunit (LSU) of\nthe ribosomal DNA, the translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1-α), and\nthe second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2), phylogeny of\nLepiota s.l., including all three species described here, is\nreconstructed and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Echinoderma and Lepiota ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tef1-a,\nMLT","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123127.phy"}]}
