Currently 18 genome sequences of Dothideomycetes are\navailable, 14 of which are newly described in this paper and in several\ncompanion papers, allowing unprecedented resolution in comparative\nanalyses. These 18 organisms have diverse lifestyles and strategies of\nplant pathogenesis. Three feed on dead organic matter only, six are\nnecrotrophs (killing the host plant cells), one is a biotroph (forming\nan association with and thus feeding on the living cells of the host\nplant cells) and 8 are hemibiotrophs (having an initial biotrophic\nstage, and killing the host plant at a later stage). These various\nlifestyles are also reflected in the gene sets present in each group.\nFor example, sets of genes involved in carbohydrate degradation and\nsecondary metabolism are expanded in necrotrophs. Many genes involved in\npathogenesis are located near repetitive sequences, which are believed\nto speed up their evolution. Blocks of genes with conserved gene order\nwere identified. In addition to this we deduce that the mechanism for\nmesosynteny, a type of genome evolution particular to Dothideomycetes,\nis by intra-chromosomal inversions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_61821.phy"}]}
