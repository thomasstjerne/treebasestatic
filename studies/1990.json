We investigated the evolutionary\nrelationships among these frogs using 2.3kb from the 12S and 16S rRNA\nmitochondrial genes. Maximum parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum\nlikelihood methods all largely agree, confirming the group\u001as monophyly\nand revealing many weaknesses in current taxonomy and understanding of\nthe systematics of the group. Results of phylogenetic analyses suggest\nthat (1) currently recognized Papuan subfamilies, Genyophryninae and\nAsterophryinae, should be combined into the Asterophryinae; (2)\ncurrently recognized genera Cophixalus and Callulops are polyphyletic,\nand (3) previous phylogenetic hypotheses can be refuted with these new\nmolecular data. Genetic divergence within Papuan microhylids is\ntremendous compared to that within other frog families. We hypothesize\nthis to be primarily due to a relatively high rate of molecular\nevolution during adaptive radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Papuan Microhylid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2971.phy"}]}
