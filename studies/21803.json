Here we report a directly documented example from its\norigin to reproductive isolation. An immigrant Darwins finch to Daphne\nMajor in the Galápagos archipelago initiated a new genetic lineage by\nbreeding with a resident finch (Geospiza fortis). Genome sequencing of\nthe immigrant identified it as a G. conirostris male that originated on\nEspañola >100km from Daphne. From the second generation onwards the\nlineage bred endogamously, and despite intense inbreeding, was\necologically successful and showed transgressive segregation of bill\nmorphology. This example shows that reproductive isolation, which\ntypically develops over hundreds of generations, can be established in\nonly three.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"181","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rapid hybrid speciation in Darwins finches","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109517.phy"}]}
