A total of 115 species of Paspalum were sampled, including taxa\nof all 4 subgenera considered. Anachyris, Ceresia, Harpostachys, and\nPaspalum, with 27 of the 28 informal groups in the latter subgenus\nanalyzed. Monophyly of the subgenera, and informal groups, is discussed\nand related to morphological, cytological and anatomical evidence. The\ninclusion of related genera, i.e., Reimarochloa, Spheneria and\nThrasyopsis, in Paspalum is also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paspalum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69168.phy"}]}
