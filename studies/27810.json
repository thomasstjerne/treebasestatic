{"Authors":" Zhan Bo Liu","Year":" 2021","Title":" Global diversity and taxonomy of Sidera (Hymenochaetales,\nBasidiomycota): four new species and keys to species of the genus","Journal":" Journal of Fungi","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Phylogenetic analysis; Rickenellaceae; wood-rotting\nfungi","DOI":"","Abstract":" The genus Sidera is a polypore genus with resupinate,\nwhite to cream or buff fresh basidioma, poroid or hydnoid hymenophore, a\nmonomitic or dimitic hyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamp\nconnections, the presence of rosette-like crys-tals, and allantoid to\nlunate basidiospores. We study the phylogeny and diversity of Sidera\nherein by using both morphological and molecular methods. Phylogenetic\nanal-yses are based on the combined 2-gene dataset (ITS+nLSU) and 7-gene\ndataset (ITS+nLSU+RPB1+RPB2+TEF1+mtSSU+nSSU) of 17 taxa of Sidera all\nover the world. Among these four species are new to science, viz.Â S.\ninflata, S. malaysiana, S. monomitica and S. punctata. In addition,\nthree taxa are treated as Sidera sp. New species are all de-scribed and\nillustrated. An identification key to 14 accepted species of Sidera in\nworld-wide is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132026","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132027","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132027.phy"}]}
