The available literature, and a\nreview by Fauchald & Rouse (1997), on the 80 accepted families of\nthe Polychaeta is used to develop characters and data matrices. As well\nas the polychaete families, non-polychaete taxa such as the Echiura,\nEuarthropoda, Onychophora, Pogonophora (as Frenulata and\nVestimentifera), Clitellata, Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae are\nincluded in the analyses. All trees are rooted using the Sipuncula as\noutgroup. Characters are based on features (where present) such as the\nprostomium, peristomium, antennae, palps, nuchal organs, parapodia,\nstomodaeum, segmental organ structure and distribution, circulation and\nchaetae. A number of analyses are performed involving different ways of\ncoding and weighting the characters, as well as the number of taxa\nincluded. Transformation series are provided for several of these\nanalyses. One of the analyses is chosen to provide a new classification.\nThe Annelida is found to be monophyletic, though weakly supported, and\ncomprises the Clitellata and Polychaeta. The Polychaeta is monophyletic\nonly if taxa such as the Pogonophora, Aeolosomatidae and Potamodrilidae\nare included and is also weakly supported. The Pogonophora is reduced to\nthe rank of family within the Polychaeta and reverts to the name\nSiboglinidae Caullery, 1914. The new classification does not use\nLinnaean categories and the Polychaeta comprises two clades, the\nScolecida and Palpat","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 61","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5493.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 56","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5490.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 59","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5491.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 58","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5492.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 57","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5489.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 60","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5494.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 62","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5495.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 63","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5496.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 65","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5497.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 64","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5498.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 66","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychaetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5499.phy"}]}
