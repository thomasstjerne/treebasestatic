Morphological, electron\nmicroscopic, and phylogenetic studies of specimens collected in both\nregions revealed that, despite this huge geographic disjunction, (1) the\nJapanese and Appalachian specimens are remarkably similar both in\nmorphology and the sampled rDNA sequences, (2) the species unambiguously\nfalls into the Morchellaceae and is separated from the genus Terfezia in\nthe Pezizaceae, (3) its spores are much larger than those of Terfezia\nspp. and are enclosed in a unique, electron-semitransparent, amorphous\nepispore that appears to be permeated with minute, meandering strands or\ncanals. In addition to the molecular phylogenetic results, the numerous\nnuclei in ascospores, the dome shaped striate ascus septal plugs and the\nlong cylindric Woronon bodies also strengthen the family assignment to\nthe Morchellaceae. Moreover, the species occurs in moist, temperate\nforests as opposed to the xeric to arid habitats of other Terfezia spp.\nWe propose the new, monotypic genus Imaia to accommodate the\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Imaia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5213.phy"}]}
