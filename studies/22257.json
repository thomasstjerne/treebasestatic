We found a smut fungus on an ovary of barnyardgrass\n(Echinochloa crus-galli) in Japan, which had been identified as M.\nbullatus. The teliospores germinated and formed yeast-like colo- nies.\nPhysiological and phylogenetic studies revealed that the characteristics\nof the yeast-like isolates coincided with those of ‘P. antarctica.’ We\nthus recognised the smut fungus as the teleomorph of M. antarcticus, and\nthen emended the description of M. antarcticus based on the holomorph.\nThe identified fungus could degrade certain biodegradable plastics and\nproduce mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) in similar qualities as the ‘P.\nantarctica’ type strain. This discovery provides a significant\nbioresource, as genetically diverse M. antarcticus isolates could be\nobtained from the smut fungus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moesziomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109936.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moesziomyces antarcticus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109934.phy"}]}
