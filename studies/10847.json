These cam be distinguished\nby characteristics of the pileus surface, the presence/absence of\nclamp-connections on generative hyphae, and the shape of the\nbasidiospores. P. subvarius is newly reported from Japan following the\noriginal description from China. The phylogenetic positions, detailed\ndescriptions, and illustrations are provided for both species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus pseudobetulinus and P. subvarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21478.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus pseudobetulinus and P. subvarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21482.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus pseudobetulinus and P. subvarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21481.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus pseudobetulinus and P. subvarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21480.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus pseudobetulinus and P. subvarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_21479.phy"}]}
