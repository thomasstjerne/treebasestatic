This\ndataset provides an opportunity to explore some challenges of\nphylogenetic analysis of genomescale datasets, which we address in\nseveral ways. We generate data matrices ranging between 2,6104,175 loci\n(1,477,3193,848,295 aligned base pairs) that represent versions of the\ndata differing in whether or not alignments were trimmed prior to\nconcatenation, and whether 100% or 75% of all taxa were required to be\npresent for inclusion of a given locus. These matrices are analyzed with\nboth maximum likelihood and coalescent algorithms, to check for\nartifacts of concatenation. Then, we subsample our data matrix into\nrandomlyselected replicates between 1251,000 loci, and compare the\nstatistical support of the resulting trees to look for evidence of\nsystematic error. In analyses of complete matrices, we find strong\nstatistical support for all ingroup nodes with no evidence for\nsystematic error introduced by alignment trimming, missing data, or\nconcatenation, and we find further support for that topology in our\nsubsampling analyses and statistical topology tests. Finally, we compare\nour strongly supported topology to those of previous studies, and use\nthe phylogeny to examine the evolutionary history of potoos.","trees":[{"tree_label":"GARLI","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 75 Complete Trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100255.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDq","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 100 Complete Untrimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100253.phy"},{"tree_label":"GARLI","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 100 Complete Untrimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100252.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDq","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 75 Complete Trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100256.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDq","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 100 Complete Trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100271.phy"},{"tree_label":"GARLI","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 100 Complete Trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100270.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDq","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 75 Complete Untrimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100273.phy"},{"tree_label":"GARLI","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potoos 75 Complete Untrimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100272.phy"}]}
