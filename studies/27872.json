B. ecuadorensis is characterised by dark gray to\nblack pore surface, a monomitic hyphal system, hyaline to\nyellowish-brown generative hyphae, and ellipsoid basidiospores measuring\n3.94.5 × 2.73 μm. B. fulgida is distinguished from the other species in\nthe genus by clay buff to pale brown and shiny pore surface. B.\nminispora is characterised by white tomentose pore mouth and small\nbasidiospores measuring 3.14.2 × 22.8 μm. B. resupinata is characterised\nby resupinate basidiocarps, pinkish buff to pale brownish pore surface,\nand ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.56 × 3.24.1\nµm. All these new species grow on angiosperm trunks or rotten wood, and\ncause a white rot. The closely related taxa to four new species are\ndiscussed. An identification key to the ten accepted species of\nBjerkandera is provided, and a phylogeny comprising all known\nBjerkandera species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bjerkandera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132809.phy"}]}
