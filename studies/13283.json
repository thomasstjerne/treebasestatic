Here we describe an ulna\nfrom the Early Cretaceous Eumeralla Formation of Australia that shares\nunique autapomorphies with the South American theropod Megaraptor. We\nalso present evidence for the spinosauroid affinities of Megaraptor.\nThis ulna represents the first Australian non-avian theropod with\nunquestionable affinities to taxa from other Gondwanan landmasses,\nsuggesting faunal interchange between eastern and western Gondwana\nduring the Mid-Cretaceous. This evidence counters claims of Laurasian\naffinities for Early Cretaceous Australian dinosaur faunas, and for the\nexistence of a geographical or climatic barrier isolating Australia from\nthe other Gondwanan continents during this time. The temporal and\ngeographical distribution of Megaraptor and the Eumeralla ulna is also\ninconsistent with traditional palaeogeographic models for the\nfragmentation of Gondwana, but compatible with several alternative\nmodels positing connections between South America and Antarctica in the\nMid-Cretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetanurae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56305.phy"}]}
