In some cases,\nsuch as the monotypic Poeobiidae, derived morphology hinders the ability\nto find convincing synapomorphies that help elucidate evolutionary\norigins. In such cases, molecular data can be useful. Poeobiidae\nconsists of the holopelagic polychaete Poeobius meseres which is\ntypically found in mid-water depths off of California. Morphologists\nhave speculated that it is close to or within Flabelligeridae, but\ndefinitive evidence was lacking. Herein we use maximum likelihood\nphylogenetic reconstruction methods to examine the nuclear 18S rDNA\n(SSU) gene and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our results strongly\nsupport the hypothesis that P. meseres is a highly derived flabelligerid\nannelid closely related to Therochaeta. Thus, Poeobiidae is a junior\nsynonym for Flabelligeridae. This result raises interesting questions\nabout the evolution of the holopelagic P. meseres from a benthic\nancestral flabelligerid.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poeobius meseres","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2127.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poeobius meseres","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2128.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poeobius meseres","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2129.phy"}]}
