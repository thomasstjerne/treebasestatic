Some Mannia species are\nrepresented several times, but from different countries. Maximum\nparsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were conducted on\nindividual and combined molecular datasets. All phylogenetic tree\ntopologies showed polytomies but suggest that Mannia has evolved from\nwithin its sister genus Asterella and that the genus falls into two main\nclades. Because Mannia is paraphyletic with Asterella gracilis nested\nwith M. triandra and M. pilosa, Asterella gracilis is transferred to\nMannia. The major differences between those genera are redefined. Based\non molecular and morphological evidence Mannia is divided into two\nsubgenera Mannia and Neesiella; Asterella subg. Graciles becomes a\nsynonym of Mannia subg. Neesiella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mannia/Aytoniacae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6392.phy"}]}
