Peronospora s. l. is shown to be paraphyletic. Based on\nmolecular and morphological evidence, several species of the genus\nPeronospora are transferred to Hyaloperonospora. Plasmopara oplismeni\nappears to be related only distantly to the other Plasmopara species,\nand is transferred to the new genus Viennotia based on molecular,\nmorphological, and ecological evidence. The remaining Plasmopara species\nare likely to be paraphyletic with respect to Bremia, Paraperonospora,\nand Basidiophora. Phytophthora is shown to be paraphyletic with respect\nto the obligatory biotrophic genera. Evidence for the assumption that\nobligatory biotrophism arose independently at least twice in\nPeronosporales is demonstrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum Likelihood","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian Inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5816.phy"}]}
