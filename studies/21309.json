The family is\ndistributed in South Africa, the Neotropical, and Andean regions. Here,\nwe use a molecular approach to infer the relationships of Drymusidae.\nMolecular data include six markers, three mitochondrial (COI, 16S, 12S)\nand three nuclear (H3, 28S, 18S). Our preferred analyses support\nDrymusidae, and its American and African clades as monophyletic, both\nemerging as sister groups. Our analyses suggest a Gondwanan distribution\nof Drymusidae and a Westward radiation of Izithunzi gen. nov. within\nSouth Africa, but both hypotheses remain to be thoroughly tested. We\ndescribe Izithunzi gen. nov. for the African species. All previous\ndescribed species were redescribed and new combinations proposed:\nIzithunzi capense (Simon) comb. nov., Izithunzi productum (Purcell)\ncomb. nov. and Izithunzi silvicola (Purcell) comb. nov.. Two new species\nwere described: Izithunzi lina sp. nov. (known from both sexes) and\nIzithunzi zondii sp. nov. (known only by female). The male of I.\nproductum (Purcell) comb. nov. was also described for the first time. We\nconsider Drymusa valida (Lawrence, 1964) a junior synonym of Izithunzi\ncapense (Simon) comb. nov. (new synonymy). We also provide a dichotomy\nkey for Izithunzi gen. nov. species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synspermiata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105798.phy"}]}
