We approach this problem here\nby synthesizing a supertree from published phylogenies using matrix\nrepresentation with parsimony (MRP). We time calibrate this supertree\nusing fossil first occurrences. The monophyly of all subfamilies except\nWillistonininae, Bathypogoninae and Phellinae is supported. Asilidae\nsplit from their closest relatives around 131 mya and comprise two major\nclades that diverged around 117 mya. The first of these clades,\nLeptogastrinae, which has an estimated origin of 104 mya, constitutes\nthe sister group to Asilinae plus Ommatiinae. In the second major clade,\nLaphriinae is the sister of the remainder of that clade; while\nWillistoninae is paraphyletic with Stichopogoninae. Most modern groups\nof Asilidae originated near the K-Pg boundary. Our supertree represents\nthe most inclusive phylogeny of Asilidae produced, and its time\ncalibration includes an estimate of the origination date for each\nsubfamily. We suggest that the diversification and radiation of asilids\nmay have been promoted by the rise of phytophagous insects, facilitated\nby the radiation of many modern plant groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"decoratedSupertree+","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111583","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111583.phy"}]}
