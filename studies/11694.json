In this study, isolates of the fungus from taro were compared\nusing multigene phylogenies for the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)\ngene region, Beta-tubulin (BT) and Transcription Elongation factor\n1-alpha (TEF1-Î±) gene regions, as well as morphological characters.\nThree well defined phylogenetic groups, separate from C. fimbriata sensu\nstricto (s.s.), were recognised and isolates could also be distinguished\nfrom each other based on morphological characters, although these were\nrelatively minor. The isolates from taro are described as distinct taxa\nand provided with the names C. aracearum, C. belula and C.\ncolocasiae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
