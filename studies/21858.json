In the present study, two new\nspecies Ganoderma angustisporum and G. casuarinicola were collected on\nthe southeast coast of China and identified on the basis of\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analyses inferred from the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS), the translation elongation factor 1-α\ngene (EF1-α) and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2). These\ntwo new species are both found on living trees of Casuarina and they are\ncompared with related taxa from other regions of the world. Ganoderma\nangustisporum is characterized by its sessile basidiomata,\nalmond-shaped, slightly truncate and narrow basidiospores (911.3 × 45.2\nµm). Ganoderma casuarinicola is characterized by its strongly laccate\nreddish brown pileal surface, luminous yellow to yellowish brown cutis\nand ellipsoid basidiospores (910.2 × 56 µm). Phylogeny confirmed that G.\nangustisporum and G. casuarinicola are clearly distinct species within\nGanoderma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108082.phy"}]}
