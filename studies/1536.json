ITS sequences\nrecovered from healthy, ectomycorrhizal roots of Quercus douglasii Hook\n& Arn. and Q. wislizenii A. DC. matched those of G. xerophilus\nbasidiomata, confirming the ectomycorrhizal status of this fungus.\nPhylogenetic analysis of the ITS region places G. xerophilus in a clade\nwith both agaricoid (Russula) and sequestrate (Gymnomyces, Cystangium)\nrelatives. We include a dichotomous key to the species of Gymnomyces\nassociated with Quercus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnomyces xerophilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2425.phy"}]}
