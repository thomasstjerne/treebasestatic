Neotropical specimens from Argentina, Bolivia and\nBrazil were studied, applying a detailed macro- and micromorphological\nexamination, and phylogenetic analyses using the nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and nuclear ribosomal large subunit\n(nrLSU). Morphological and phylogenetic analysis, led us to conclude\nthat P. subpurpurascens represent a Neofavolus species. Neofavolus\nsubpurpurascens is proposed as a new combination; new records for the\nspecies are presented as well as a detailed description and photos.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112496","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112496.phy"}]}
