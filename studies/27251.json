C. densopora is\ncharacterized by a laterally stipitate basidiocarp with flabelliform to\nsemicircular pileus, hirtellous pileal surface with appressed coarse\nhair and concentrically zoned and sulcate, tiny pores (1012 per mm), a\ndimitic hyphal system, absence of cystidia, short clavate basidia and\nthin-walled, smooth, cylindrical to allantoid basidiospores. F.\nsubglobosa is characterized by a sessile or laterally stipitate\nbasidiocarp, velutinate to glabrous pileal surface concentrically zoned\nand indistinctly sulcate, tiny pores (1115 per mm), a dimitic hyphal\nsystem, absence of cystidia, guttulate, short, clavate to subglobose\nbasidia and thin-walled, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores.\nPhylogenetic analyses based on a four-marker dataset were performed\nusing maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The new genus\nConiferitrullella formed an independent clade with strong support in\nSteccherinaceae and the two new species C. densopora and F. subglobosa\nget full support respectively. The distinguishing characters of the the\nnew genus and species as well as allied genera are discussed and a key\nto species of Flabellophora was provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127220","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127220.phy"}]}
