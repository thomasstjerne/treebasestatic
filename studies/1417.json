All occur on\ndecorticated wood and all are associated with blue-green staining of\nthat wood. Some species are consistently associated with soft, rotten\nwood, while others are consistently associated with fallen wood that\nremains hard and appears more or less intact. The range of morphological\nvariation accepted in the genus is broader than has previously been\ndescribed, especially with respect to ascospore size and shape. Two of\nthe species have filiform ascospores that coil on release from the asci.\nSpecies are distinguished on the basis of variation in ascospore size\nand shape, the presence or absence of either smooth-walled or\nrough-walled tomentum hyphae, and on macroscopic appearance. The\nvalidity of the generic and species concepts was tested using rDNA ITS\nsequences. Of species previously reported for New Zealand, only C.\nargentinensis is accepted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 32","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorociboria in New Zealand","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_317.phy"}]}
