Numerous\nstudies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex.\nMultilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, Tub2, CHS-1,\nGAPDH, HIS3) of 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and\nother related taxa, including strains from numerous hosts with wide\ngeographic distributions, confirmed the molecular groups previously\nrecognised and identified a series of novel taxa. Thirty-one species are\naccepted, of which 21 have not previously been recognised.\nColletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species\ncomplex. There is a high phenotypic diversity within this complex, and\nsome of the species appear to have preferences to specific host or\ngeographical regions. Others appear to be plurivorous and are present in\nmultiple regions. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme\nformed sexual states in culture, although sexual morphs have been\ndescribed from other taxa (especially as laboratory crosses), and there\nis evidence of hybridisation between different species. One species with\nsimilar morphology to C. acutatum but not belonging to this species\ncomplex was also described here as new, namely C. pseudoacutatum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"330","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum acutatum species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58144.phy"}]}
