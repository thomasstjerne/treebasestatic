Eleven species of different generic\ngroups of the subtribe Dicercina were considered as outgroups, including\nalso species of Lampetis (Lampetis) and one South American species of L.\n(Spinthoptera). The monophyly of Lampetis (Spinthoptera) is supported by\ntwo synapomorphies, but this subgenus appears to be more closely related\nto species of Psiloptera rather than to Old World species of Lampetis\n(Lampetis), suggesting that Lampetis (Spinthoptera) may be segregated\nfrom Lampetis as a different genus. The species of Lampetis\n(Spinthoptera) from North and Central America and the West Indies do not\nrepresent a monophyletic taxon, because L. (S.) tucumana (South American\noutgroup) is nested within them. Comparison of these results with a\nprevious panbiogeographic analysis indicate that several generalised\ntracks possess species from different clades, thus suggesting an ancient\nradiation of this taxon in Mesoamerica and the Mexican Transition\nZone.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lampetis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lampetis, bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_675.phy"}]}
