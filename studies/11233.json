A highly supported\ngroup of species were resolved separately from Licuala, the rest of the\nLivistoninae, and are the sister group of Johannesteijsmannia, requiring\nthat the segregate group be placed in a new genus. In this study, a\nphylogeny based on seven gene regions resolves highly supported generic\nrelationships of the Livistoninae, but due to gene-tree incongruence,\ndoes not unequivocally recover inter-specific relationships. A survey of\nLicuala specimens from several herbaria indicates that, based on\nmorphology, eight species should be recognized within this genus. A\ncomplete description of the new genus, Lanonia, is given. A review of\nmorphology distinguishes synapomorphies in leaf morphology and dioecy of\nLanonia species. All eight species are described with complete synonymy,\ntheir distributions are mapped, lists of specimens examined are given,\nand six species are illustrated with color images. One species occurs in\nHainan, one in Java, and six are endemic or nearly endemic to Vietnam.\nThe following new combinations are made - L. acaulis, L. calciphila, L.\ncentralis, L. dasyantha, L. gracilis, L. hainanensis, L. hexasepala, and\nL. magalonii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr27634","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_27634.phy"}]}
