These individuals are considered to\nbe conspecific and the amphiboreal distribution of P. elegans is here\nconfirmed. Adult morphology of the species is briefly described and\nillustrated. The diagnosis of the genus Pygospio is emended to include\nP. elegans, P. californica Hartman, 1936 and a third undescribed species\nfrom Oregon recognized in the present study. It is suggested that the\ntaxonomy of Pygospio muscularis Ward, 1981 and Pseudopolydora primigenia\nBlake, 1983 should be revised based on phylogenetic analysis of\nmorphological and molecular characteristics of Pygospio and\nPseudopolydora species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relationships of Pygospio based on a\nBayesian analysis of combined 16S, 18S, 28S and H3 data sets","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77215.phy"}]}
