For molecular analyses we used three markers (LSU, ITS\nand tef1-α). The molecular analyses revealed the existence of two\nmorphologically similar species. One of them, Fomitiporia impercepta sp.\nnov., is described here. The phylogenetic position of these species\nreveals a South American origin and their occurrence on exotic living\ntree species hints at their capabilities of new host jump events in\nevolution. These species do not share same hosts suggesting they are not\ncompletely generalist wood-decay fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106343","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106343.phy"}]}
