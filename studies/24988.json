The primer pairs LR05 and ITS4 amplified the\nnuclear large subunit region with sequence length of 906 bp. The\nsequence was deposited to GenBank with accession no MK660093. The\nevolutionary relationship of the sample was studied with its\nmorphologically and microscopically closely related species. The\nphylogenetics analysis was done in MEGA X(ver 7.0.1.1) software. The\nalignment was done in MEGA X with Muscle, Model testing was done in MEGA\nand the best fit model was found to be K2+ G with log value -4415 and\nBIC value of 9125. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using Maximum\nLikelihood method with 1000 replicas using Kimura 2+ Gamma parameters.\nThe macro and Micromorphological characters of the specimen along with\nmolecular study confirmed the specimen to be Cantharellus\nsubamethysteus. This is the first report of this species from\nIndia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120846.phy"}]}
