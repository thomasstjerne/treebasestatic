Untangling which of\nthese processes can explain incongruence among gene trees is difficult,\nbut has recently been addressed using methods that simulate the\ncoalescent. We used a method previously described for two gene trees and\nextend it here to utilize a third gene tree. We show that the\nsensitivity of the test improves markedly with an acceptable type 1\nerror rate. Using sequences from low copy nuclear genes in Citrus\n(Rutaceae), a group of plants with a complex past that includes known\nand suspected hybrids, we were able to diagnose cases of hybridization\npreviously detected by SSRs using population genetic methods, but also\ncases where these markers failed to do so. Of six gene trees examined in\nCitrus, we used the most resolved three for the coalescence test, but\nnote that the remaining genes show patterns that were consistent with\nthe conclusions from the test. The consistent patterns observed among\nthe six loci also allowed us to rule out mistaken orthology (caused by\ngene duplication and loss) in most cases where the null hypothesis of\nlineage sorting was rejected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Supp Fig. 4","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21355.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21356.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp Fig. 5","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21354.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21353.phy"}]}
