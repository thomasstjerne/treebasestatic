Both parsimony and Bayesian\nanalyses were conducted on separate and combined data partitions. The\nBayesian phylogeny from the combined analysis was selected as the\npreferred phylogenetic hypothesis. The hypothesis supports monophyly of\nthe genus Gammarus, paraphyly of the European-North American Gammarus,\nand monophyly of the Asian Gammarus. The Asian clade was further split\ninto a southeastern group and a northwestern group. The dramatic climate\nchange following the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau was probably the most\nimportant factor in triggering the diversification of southeastern and\nnorthwestern groups. The genus Sinogammarus is invalid and should be\npart of the genus Gammarus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S rDNA","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gammarus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2832.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S rDNA","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gammarus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gammarus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2834.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtDNA","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gammarus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2835.phy"}]}
