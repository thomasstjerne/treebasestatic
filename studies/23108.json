Epicoccum spp. are found\nin the soil, phyllosphere, as well as in the wood, where they interact\nboth with the plant and with other endophytes and pathogens. Wood\npathogens involved in the esca disease complex, a grapevine trunk\ndisease, are particularly concerning in viticulture, as current control\nstrategies have proven unsatisfactory. This study investigated the\ninteraction among Epicoccum spp. and three esca-associated fungi, with\nthe aim of establishing whether they are suitable candidates for\nbiological control.A screening conducted in vitro, by means of dual\nculture, revealed that all tested Epicoccum spp. inhibited the growth of\npathogens Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Fomitiporia mediterranea,\nwhile only some of them inhibited Phaeoacremonium minimum. Epicoccum\nlayuense E24, identified as the most efficient antagonist, was tested in\nrooted grapevine cuttings of cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga\nNacional, under greenhouse conditions, against P. chlamydospora and P.\nminimum. This study revealed that the inoculation of E. layuense E24\nproduced a successful colonization of the wood of grapevines; in\naddition it did not impair the growth of the plants or induce the\nappearance of symptoms in leaves or in wood. Moreover, grapevines\ncolonized by E. layuense E24 showed a considerable decrease in the wood\nsymptomatology caused by the inoculated pathogens (by 3182%, depending\non the pathogen/grapevine cultivar), as well as a reduction in their\nfrequency of re-isolation (6074%).Our findings suggest that E. layuense\nE24 is a promising candidate for its application in biological control,\ndue to its antagonistic interaction with some esca-associated fungal\npathogens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RPB2_ 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113142.phy"},{"tree_label":"TUB2_ 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes TUB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113140.phy"},{"tree_label":"TUB2_ 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes TUB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113141.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113139.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_ 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113138.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2_con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113143.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_ITS","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum RAxML ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113144.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_TUB2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum RAxML TUB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combine_50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes combine","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113149.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combine_50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum MrBayes combine","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113148.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_Combine","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum RAxML Combine","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113147.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_RPB2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epicoccum RAxML RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113146.phy"}]}
