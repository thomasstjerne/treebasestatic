One hundred accessions were analyzed, including 86 specimens\nof Sium s.l., representing all taxa throughout their geographical range.\nThe phylogenetic analyses showed that Afrocarum and the African and\nSt.Â Helena species of Sium were nested within Berula forming the Berula\ns.l. clade. The remaining species of Sium constituted a weakly supported\nSium s.s. clade. The cultivated S. sisarum is closely related to the\nwest Asian S. sisaroideum. The divergence of Sium s.s. from Berula s.l.,\nestimated under the assumption of a molecular clock and using a\nsubstitution rate of 0.61% per million years, took place around 10.4\nmillion years ago. Dispersal\u001avicariance analysis suggested that the\nbiogeographic pattern of this group resulted from simple vicariance and\neventual migration to adjacent areas rather than from long-distance\ndispersal. The ancestral area of Sium s.l. was probably western\nPalearctic. The dispersal of Berula to North America occurred ca. 3\nmillion years ago, possibly by island hopping. The migration of S. suave\nto North America took place ca 0.6 million years ago through\nBeringia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4594.phy"}]}
