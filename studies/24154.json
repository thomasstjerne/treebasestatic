The history of powdery mildew\non flax in UK is critically discussed. DNA sequence data (ITS) have been\nretrieved from the British material and in additional from a German\ncollection and used for phylogenetic analyses. The position of P. lini\nas species of its own in the genus Podosphaera, close to P. macularis\n(hop powdery mildew), could be confirmed, which is in concordance with\nmorphological traits of the flax powdery mildew, above all with small\nperidial cells of the chasmothecia, placing this species in Podosphaera\nsect. Podosphaera subsect. Podosphaera. Oidium lini, described from\nCroatia, was previously erroneously reduced to synonymy with\nGolovinomyces orontii, but this species names has been reassessed and is\nnow regarded as a synonym of Podosphaera lini. Oidium lini, cited in\nliterature as name published by Bondartsev in 1913, is critically\ndiscussed and shown to be very doubtful, i.e., this name has probably\nnever been validly introduced.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podosphaera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128375.phy"}]}
