Character evolution was\ninferred using parsimony approaches for nine continuous and three\ndiscrete traits related to trichomes, fruits, seeds, and pollen. Two\nmonophyletic clades were recovered within Physarieae: the DDNLS clade,\nwhich included five genera (Dithyrea, Dimorphocarpa, Nerisyrenia,\nLyrocarpa, and Synthlipsis), and the PP clade, which comprised two\ngenera (Paysonia and Physaria). Under this new phylogenetic context, the\nmultiaperturate pollen condition was confirmed as a potential\nsynapomorphy of the tribe. In addition five continuous traits of fruits\nand seeds were identified as other potential synapomorphies for\nPhysarieae. The analyses also suggested that members of the DDNLS clade,\nin comparison to those of the PP clade, have highly branched dendritic\ntrichomes, narrower replums, longer fruits, and wider seeds. Moreover,\ninferred ancestral states for the continuous traits in Physarieae showed\nthat there is a general trend towards enlarged fruits and replums,\nlonger styles, wider seeds, and longer seed primary grooves","trees":[{"tree_label":"Physarieae ndhF MP tree","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50705","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50705.phy"},{"tree_label":"Physarieae ndhF ML tree","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50706","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50706.phy"}]}
