The isolates were characterized\nthrough morphological studies and via phylogenetic analyses of actin,\nβ-tubulin (tub 2), calmodulin (CAL), glutamine synthetase (GS),\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDPH) and the rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence data. The combined dataset showed\nthat 22 out of the 28 strains was a novel species being a common\npathogens of Vitis vinifera (grape) and occurring on other Vitaceae,\nwhile C. fructicola (four strains) and C. gloeosporioides (two strains)\nwere uncommon. The new species is described as Colletotrichum vinifera\nin this paper and is illustrated and compared with similar\nColletotrichum species. The new species is justified based on both\nmorphological characters and multigene sequence data. Pathogenicity\ntesting to perform Kochs postulate indicated that Colletotrichum\nvinifera causes leaf spots and anthracnose of table grape but not\nhost-specific.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48688","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48688.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48686","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48686.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48687","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48687.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48689","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48689.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48690.phy"}]}
