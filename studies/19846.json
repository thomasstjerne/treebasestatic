Phylogenetic analysis based on the\nmulti-locus sequences of ITS, LSU, TUB2 and RPB2 confirmed the\ndistinction of these species in Paraboeremia. These species were\ndiscovered from habitats or hosts that are previously unknown from this\ngenus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98415","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98415.phy"}]}
