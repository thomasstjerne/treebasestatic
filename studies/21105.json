Fruit-bodies of this fungus have been called as\n“Yuki-shiro”, “Yuki-take”, or “Yuki-wari” and utilized as an edible\nmushroom for local people in the central region of Nagano, Japan.\nHygrophorus yukishiro fruits in the early spring season under\noak-dominated stands. Morphological observation and phylogenetic\nanalysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear\nribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene indicated that H. yukishiro is the sister\nspecies of H. arbustivus and belongs to section Hygrophorus, subsect.\nFulventes. Hygrophorus yukishiro is similar to H. roseobrunneus, H.\nleucophaeo-ilicis and H. roseodiscoideus in their external morphology\nand fruiting phenology, but distinguished form them in the color and\ntexture of pileus surface and microscopic characteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105138.phy"}]}
