Sequences of 22 Diploschistes species were aligned to\nthose of six other species of Thelotremataceae, Graphis scripta, and\nAspicilia cinerea, which was used as outgroup. The alignment was\nanalysed cladistically using maximum parsimony. In the most parsimonious\ntrees, Diploschistes is monophyletic, with D. ocellatus being a\nsister-group to the remaining Diploschistes spp. (= Diploschistes s.\nstr.). A former cladistic analysis of morphological data suggested an\nevolutionary trend within the genus from perithecioid to urceolate\nascomata. The present ITS data suggest the opposite: perithecioid\nascomata are apparently an apomorphic character within the genus, with\nthe actinostomus group forming a derived monophyletic clade. However,\nthe topology within Diploschistes s.str. lacks strong bootstrap\nsupport.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diploschistes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_883.phy"}]}
