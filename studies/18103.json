However, conflicting or\nâoutlierâ associations (i.e., linked pairs of Operational Terminal Units\nin two phylogenies) among these data sets often provide valuable\ninformation on evolutionary processes such as chloroplast capture\nfollowing hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and horizontal gene\ntransfer. Statistical tools that to date have been used in\ncophylogenetic studies only have also the potential to test for the\ndegree of topological congruence between organellar and nuclear data\nsets and reliably detect outlier associations. Two distance-based\nmethods, namely ParaFit and Procrustean Approach to Cophylogeny (PACo),\nwere used in conjunction to detect those outliers contributing to\nconflicting phylogenies independently derived from chloroplast and\nnuclear sequence data. We explored their efficiency of retrieving\noutlier associations, and the impact of input data (unit branch length\nand additive trees) between data sets, by using several simulation\napproaches. In order to test their performance using real data sets, we\nadditionally inferred the phylogenetic relationships within Neotropical\nCatasetinae (Epidendroideae, Orchidaceae), which is a suitable group to\ninvestigate phylogenetic incongruence because of hybridization processes\nbetween some of its constituent species. A comparison between trees\nderived from chloroplast and nuclear sequence data reflected strong,\nwell supported incongruence within Catasetum, Cycnoches, and Mormodes.\nAs a result, outliers among chloroplast and nuclear data sets, and in\nexperimental simulations, were successfully detected by PACo when using\npatristic distance matrices obtained from phylograms, but not from unit\nbranch length trees. The performance of ParaFit was overall inferior\ncompared to PACo, using either phylograms or unit branch lengths as\ninput data. Because workflows for applying cophylogenetic analyses are\nnot standardized yet, we provide a pipeline for executing PACo and\nParaFit as well as displaying outlier associations in plots and trees by\nusing the software R. The pipeline renders a method to identify outliers\nwith high reliability and to assess the combinability of the\nindependently derived data sets by means of statistical analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gen.24000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89717","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89717.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.25000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89718","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89718.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.26000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89719","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89719.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.27000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89720","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89720.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.28000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89721","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89721.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.20000000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89722","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89722.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.3000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89756","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89756.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.2000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89695","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89695.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.3000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89696","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89696.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.4000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89697","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89697.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.5000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89698","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89698.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.6000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89699.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.7000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89700","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89700.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.8000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89701","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89701.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.9000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89702","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89702.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.10000","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89703","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus_tree_Satyrium_CP","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89691","tree_kind":"Species
