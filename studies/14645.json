Twenty one Meliolaceae are reported for the first time for\nPanama and six species of plants are cited as hosts for meliolaceous\nfungi for the first time. In a phylogenetic hypothesis based on 28S\nnrDNA sequences, the position of Meliolales including Appendiculella,\nAsteridiella, Endomeliola, Irenopsis and Meliola basal to\nSordariomycetidae, Hypocreomycetidae, and Xylariomycetidae within\nSordariomycetes is supported. The five genera of Meliolaceae form a\nstrongly supported clade. Adopting the concept of the subclass\nMeliolomycetidae is suggested. The monophyly of Asteridiella could not\nbe confirmed. A hypothetical close relationship between Asteridiella and\nAppendiculella was not supported, but Endomeliola appeared closely\nrelated to a species of Asteridiella. Two Meliola species on the same\nhost family were closely related.","trees":[{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66207","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66207.phy"}]}
