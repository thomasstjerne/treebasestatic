Microgilia, and is characterized by regional differentiation most\nlikely associated with climatic and topographic changes that occurred\nduring the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. The cladogram provides\nevidence for the independent evolution of alpine, sub-alpine, and\nlowland races in the Rocky Mountains and the eastern perimeter of the\nGreat Basin, correlated with a progressive change in inflorescence\narchitecture, trichome distribution, and floral morphology. Based on\nmorphological studies and examination of all type specimens, a taxonomic\nrevision is proposed that summarizes morphological, geographical, and\ncladistic patterns within the complex. We recognize 1. spicata as\ncomposed of five principal geographic races treated as: subsp. spicata,\nsubsp. capitata, subsp. orchidacea (comb. nov.), subsp. robruthii\n(subsp. nov.), and subsp. tridactyla (comb. nov.). Subspecies orchidacea\nincludes var. orchidacea and var. cephaloidea (comb. nov.), which differ\nin ecological distribution and inflorescence architecture but intergrade\nin parts of their sympatry. Subspecies robruthii is described from the\nAbsaroka Range of northwestern Wyoming.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ipomopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4279.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ipomopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4280.phy"}]}
