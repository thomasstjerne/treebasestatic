Among them, H. bambusicola and H. orientalis are described and\nillustrated as new to science. Hymenochaete bambusicola is found\nexclusively on dead bamboos in northern Thailand and southwestern China,\nand characterized by the presence of dendrohyphidia and skeletal hyphae.\nIt is phylogenetically and morphologically closely related to H. innexa\nand H. tropica. Hymenochaete orientalis is found on bamboos in Taiwan\nand on angiosperm branches in southern China. It is distinguished by the\nabsence of a hyphal layer and by having relatively large,\noblong-ellipsoid to cylindrical basidiospores. Hymenochaete orientalis\nis morphologically similar to H. longispora and H. cinnamomea, and forms\na distinct lineage close to H. cinnamomea in the ITS+nrLSU based\nphylogenetic analyses. An identification key to the six species on\nbamboos is given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaete MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107863.phy"}]}
