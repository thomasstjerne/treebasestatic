Here we aimed to\nreveal phylogeny, historical biogiography and age of diversification of\nArchaesolanum. We sampled all recognized species of the group and\nsequenced the trnT-trnF chloroplast region, and calibrated a molecular\nclock to estimate the age of the group. Distributional data was combined\nwith the results of phylogenetic analysis to track the historical\nprocesses responsible for the current range of the group. Our analysis\nsupported the monophyly of the kangaroo apples and the biogeographical\ndisjunction between the two subclades within the group. Based on the\ndivergence time estimates the most recent common ancestor of the\nkangaroo apples is from the late Miocene age (~ 9 MY). Based on the age\nestimate the common ancestors of the kangaroo apples are presumed to\nhave arrived to Australia by long-distance dispersal. The two distinct\nlineages within the group have separated during the continental dry out\nof the continent and further speciated during the brief resurgence of\nrainforest in the Pliocene age.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaesolanum trnT-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7019.phy"}]}
