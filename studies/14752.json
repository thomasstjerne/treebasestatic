The\nphylogeny of the Pangasiidae was also reconstructed in order to\ninvestigate host-parasite co-evolutionary history. The monophyly of\nThaparocleidus parasitizing Pangasiidae was confirmed. Low intra-species\nmolecular variability was observed in three Thaparocleidus species\ncollected from geographically distant localities. However, a high\nintra-species molecular variability was observed in two Thaparocleidus\nspecies suggesting that these species represent a complex of species\nhighly similar in morphology. When comparing host and parasite\nphylogenetic reconstructions, distance-based as well as tree-based\nmethods revealed a significant global fit between parasite and host\nphylogenies. Using different event costs schemes, parasite duplication\n(i.e. intrahost speciation) was recognized as the most common event in\nThaparocleidus, while the numbers of cospeciation and host switches were\nlower and similar to each other. When collapsing nodes corresponding to\nduplication cases, our results suggest host-switches in the\nThaparocleidus-Pangasiidae system precluding congruence between host and\nparasite trees. The morphometric variability of the parasite attachment\norgan was investigated and it was found that this variability is not\nlinked to phylogeny, suggesting that the attachment organ is under\nadaptive constraint. We showed that haptor morphometry is linked to host\nspecificity, whereby non-specific parasites display higher morphometric\nvariability than specialists.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule Cons of 54 trees","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66856.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66855.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66888.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66889.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66890.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66887.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thaparocleidus parasitizing Asian pangasiid\ncatfishes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66854.phy"}]}
