R.Br. ex\nHook. is distributed across alpine and high latitude regions of Europe\nand western Asia and is sympatric with the recently described octoploid\nC. bithynica S. Jess., L. Lehm. & Bujnoch in northcentral Turkey.\nOur analysis of a 6 locus plastid DNA sequence dataset comprised of 39\naccessions of Cryptogramma R.Br., including 14 populations of C. crispa\nand one population of C. bithynica, revealed a deep genetic division\nbetween samples of C. crispa from western, northern and central Europe\nwith populations of C. crispa and C. bithynica from Turkey and the\nCaucasus Mountains. This legacy likely results from Pleistocene climate\nfluctuations and appears to represent incipient speciation between the\neastern and western clades. These plastid DNA sequence data also\ndemonstrate that C. crispa, specifically the western Asian clade, is the\nmaternal parent of C. bithynica. Our analysis of DNA sequence data from\nthe biparentally inherited nuclear locus gapCp support an autopolyploid\norigin of C. bithynica, with C. crispa as the sole progenitor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptogramma sect.
