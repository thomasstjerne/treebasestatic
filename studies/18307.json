Mutinus albotruncatus is\ndescribed macro- and microscopically, and characterized by the white\npseudostipe and truncated apex. Molecular and ecological data are also\nprovided. Phylogenetic analyses, based on LSU (large subunit of nuclear\nribosomal DNA) and atp6 (subunit 6 of ATP synthase) sequences, support\nthe inclusion of this new species in the genus Mutinus. A provisional\nkey to the world species of Mutinus is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mutinus albotruncatus nucLSU+atp6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96261.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mutinus albotruncatus nucLSU+atp6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96260.phy"}]}
