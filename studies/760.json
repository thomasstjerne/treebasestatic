Based on molecular sequence data, specifically the large subunit\nof the nuclear ribosomal DNA, it was determined that G. uvicola is a\nmember of the Diaporthales. Greeneria uvicola is re-described and\nillustrated based on two recent collections and comparison with the type\nspecimen. Data are also presented that suggests the family\nMagnaporthaceae, including Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph: Pyricularia\ngrisea) and Gaeumannomyces graminis, plant pathogens of wheat, rice and\nother grass crops, should be excluded from the Diaporthales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Greeneria uvicola and the Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3832.phy"}]}
