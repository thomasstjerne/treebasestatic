Serm. et Bizarri\n(Pinales: Cupressaceae) is a keystone tree species in South America.\nMortality of A. chilensis has been reported in most of its distribution\nin Argentina, and Phytophthora austrocedri has been identified as the\ncausal agent. The aim of this work was to evaluate rhizospheric\nmicroorganisms present in A. chilensis roots as biocontrol agents\nagainst P. austrocedri. Growth of P. austrocedri was inhibited by seven\nfungal and four bacterial isolates in vitro. Interaction among isolates\nand P. austrocedri was microscopically studied and using dual culture\ntechniques. Isolates with high in vitro effect were molecularly\nidentified and inoculated in plants to evaluate their ability to reduce\nthe effect of the pathogen. Two of the fungicide bacterial isolates were\nalso able to induce a reduction of the syntomathology in A. chilensis\ntrees. These findings are promising since they may contribute to the\ndevelopment of a biocontrol strategy to the disease","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121898","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121898.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121899","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121899.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121900.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121897.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121901.phy"}]}
