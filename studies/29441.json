The species was collected in\nYunnan Province, where it grew on the undersides of a rotten bamboo. X.\nxxx is characterized by annual, resupinate basidioma with a pinkish buff\nhymenophore, a monomitic hyphal system, generative hyphae thin-walled\nwith clamp connections, presence of voluminous crystalline masses\nbetween hyphal layer, absence of cystidia and cystidioles, and broadly\nellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measuring 3.85 × 3.34 μm. The\nphylogenetic analysis based on the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) dataset\nshows that the new species belongs to Xenasmatella. The difference\nbetween X. xxx and other members of the genus are discussed. In\naddition, two new combinations, X. gossypina and X. wuliangshanensis,\nare also proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135709","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135709.phy"}]}
