However, in recently diverged\nlineages stochastic population processes, such as retention of ancestral\npolymorphism or secondary contact, can also explain discordant\ngenealogies, even in fully co-speciating taxa. The relatively simple\nbiogeographic arrangement of the Galápagos archipelago, compared with\nmainland biomes, provides a framework to identify stochastic and\nevolutionary informative components of genealogic data in these recently\ndiverged organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrsidea ML of COI haplotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47736.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Analges, ML of COI haplotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mimus, ML of COI haplotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47734.phy"}]}
