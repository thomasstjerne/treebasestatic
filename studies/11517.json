Based on a combined\nITS- and LSU-rDNA Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony\nanalyses, Musumecia clearly clusters within the Tricholomatoid clade,\nwhere it is sister to Pseudoclitocybe. Musumecia is distinguished from\nits allied genera by a unique combination of macro- and\nmicromorphological characters, including basidiomes with a\nclitocyboid/hygrophoroid habit, emerging from a fleshy pseudosclerotial\nmass (pseudosclerotium), decurrent and thick lamellae, strong brown\ndiscolouration of lamellae and stipe, whitish-cream spore print,\nelongated non-siderophilous basidia, smooth, acyanophilous and inamyloid\nbasidiospores, and the absence of both cystidia and\nclamp-connections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Musumecia bettlachensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46095.phy"}]}
