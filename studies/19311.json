The production of 3-NPA by endophytes has been\nreported, but the function and biosynthesis are not well-defined. The\nspecie of endophytic strain G-01 was confirmed as Diaporthe citri using\na multilocus sequence analysis, and was verified different\nconcentrations of 3-NPA produced at different initial pHs by these\nstrain. The chemical analysis indicated that 3-NPA was the majority\ncompound present in the crude extracts. The better extraction condition\nwas at an initial pH of 7.0 for 22 days, yielding about 80% of 3-NPA per\nmg of extract. It was observed that the concentration of 3-NPA increased\nafter the initial consumption of reduction sugars, indicating that the\ncompound is produced after the high energetic production phase of the\nfungus. These and other studies demonstrate the production of this\ncompound by plants and endophytic fungi, indicating that 3-NPA may be\ninvolved in defence and nutrition systems of endophytes and host plants,\nand they also might participate in the biogeochemical nitrogen\ncycle.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endophytic Diaporthe citri ITS, EF1a, TUB","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96090.phy"}]}
