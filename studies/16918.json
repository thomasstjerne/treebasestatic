In this paper, we\nuse dated phylogenies of 12 plant clades from the Cape Floristic Region\n(CFR) in southern Africa to test hypotheses of Neogene climatic and\ngeomorphic evolution. Our combined dataset strengthens and refines\nprevious palaeoenvironmental reconstructions weakened by a sparse,\nmostly offshore fossil record. Our reconstructions show remarkable\nconsistency with regard to both the types of environments identified as\nancestral, and the timing of shifts to alternative conditions. They\nreveal that Early Miocene land surfaces of the CFR were wetter than at\npresent and were dominated by quartzitic substrata. These conditions\ncontinue to characterize the higher-elevation settings of the Cape Fold\nBelt, where they have fostered the persistence of ancient fynbos\nlineages. The Middle Miocene (13-17 Ma) saw the development of perennial\nto weak seasonally-arid conditions, with the strongly seasonal rainfall\nregime of the west coast arising ~6.5-8 Ma. Although the Late Miocene\nmay have seen some exposure of the underlying shale substrata, the\npresent-day substrate diversity of the CFR lowlands was shaped by\nPliocene-Pleistocene events. Particularly important was renewed erosion,\nfollowing the post-African II uplift episode, and the reworking of\nsediments on the coastal platform as a consequence of marine\ntransgressions and tectonic uplift. These changes facilitated adaptive\nradiations in some, but not all, lineages studied.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Leucadendron_tree1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80831","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poales_tree1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80832","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Arctotidinae_tree1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80837","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Elegia_tree1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80836","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Protea_tree1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80834","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Orchidaceae_tree1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80833","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Satyrium_tree1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80830","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Coryciinae_tree1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80840","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80840.phy"},{"tree_label":"Danthonieae_tree1","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80838","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80838.phy"},{"tree_label":"Moraea_tree1","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80839","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80839.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ehrharta_tree1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80835","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80835.phy"}]}
