We sequenced a\nmitochondrial (ND4) and nuclear (R35) gene of two putative hybrid\nindividuals, along with representatives of the potential parental\nspecies (Mauremys mutica, M. reevesii, M. sinensis), to determine their\ngenetic identity. Based on our data, both individuals are hybrids, with\nindependent, recent origins resulting from the mating of a female M.\nreevesii and a male M. sinensis. Since we question whether the highly\ntraded M. reevesii is endemic to Taiwan, this hybridization could\nrepresent human-mediated genetic pollution. We also discuss the\nimplications of our findings on turtle conservation in Taiwan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mauremys, nuDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6885.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mauremys, mtDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6942.phy"}]}
