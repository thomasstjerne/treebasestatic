Rosidae were placed among lower Hamamelidae as the sister\ngroup of Platanus and Hamamelidaceae. Higher Hamamelidae (Fagales,\nJuglandales, and Casuarinaceae), Dilleniidae, and Asteridae nest within\na paraphyletic Rosidae. With some expansion, the traditional Asteridae\nare monophyletic. For example, the problematic Columellia was placed\namong Asteridae as the sister group of Caprifoliaceae. Asteridae were\nplaced as the sister group of Ericales among rosids circumscribed as\nCorniflorae in recent classifications of Dahlgren. Special attention was\ngiven to problematic groups that have been allied variously with\nAsteridae, Dilleniidae, and Rosidae. For example, Actinidiaceae and\nFouquieriaceae were placed among Ericales. Loasaceae and Sarraceniaceae\nformed the sister group of Hydrangeaceae in the Corniflorae grade of\nRosidae. Dilleniidae were not monophyletic. For example, Paeonia was\nplaced as the sister taxon of the rest of the Rosidae (including\ndilleniids and asterids), and Ochnaceae as the sister taxon of Linales.\nDilleniaceae and Theaceae form a monophyletic group with Paracryphia\nplaced as the sister group of Rhizophoraceae and Anisophylleaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rosidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4359.phy"}]}
