However,\nsampling of red algal diversity is still quite limited. We aimed to\nremedy this problem. To this end, we sequenced six new plastid genomes\nfrom four undersampled and phylogenetically disparate red algal classes\n(Porpyridiophyceae, Styloneamtophyceae, Compsopogonophyceae and\nRhodellophyceae) and discovered an unprecedented degree of genomic\ndiversity among them. These genomes are rich in introns, enlarged\nintergenic regions and transposable elements (in the rhodellophycean\nBulboplastis apyrenoidosa), and include the largest and most intron-rich\nplastid genomes ever sequenced (that of the rhodellophycean\nCorynoplastis japonica; 1.13 Mbp). Sophisticated phylogenetic analyses\naccounting for compositional heterogeneity show that these four ‘basal’\nred algal classes form a larger monophyletic group, Proteorhodophytina\nsubphylum nov., and confidently resolve the large-scale relationships in\nthe Rhodophyta. Our analyses also suggest that secondary red plastids\noriginated before the diversification of all mesophilic red algae. Our\ngenomic survey has challenged the current paradigmatic view of red algal\nplastid genomes as ‘living-fossils’ by revealing an astonishing degree\nof divergence in sizes, organizations, and non-coding DNA content. A\ncloser look at red algae uncovers an extraordrinary diversity among\ntheir plastid genomes, comprising the most ancestral, as well some of\nthe most divergent plastid genomes known.","trees":[{"tree_label":"91x106-IQTREE-LG+C60+F+R6","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103872.phy"},{"tree_label":"91x106-IQTREE-LG+PMSF1+F+R6","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103873.phy"},{"tree_label":"91x106-PhyloBayes-CAT+GTR","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103874.phy"},{"tree_label":"42x170-IQTREE-LG+PMSF1+F+R6","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103870.phy"},{"tree_label":"42x170-PhyloBayes-CAT+GTR","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103871.phy"},{"tree_label":"42x170-IQTREE-LG+C60+F+R6","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteorhodophytina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103869.phy"}]}
