These\ninteractions occur in the presence of additional microbes that can\nmodify fungal phenotypes, such as endohyphal bacteria. Here we examine\nthe occurrence, diversity, and composition of endohyphal bacteria (EHB)\nin fungi that colonize seeds and leaves of plants in tropical forests.\nWe use PCR and visual fluorescence to detect EHB among fungi, and a\nphylogenetic approach to explore the evolutionary relationships among\nseed- and leaf-inhabiting fungi and their bacterial partners. Analyses\nfocusing on two prevalent orders of fungi (Hypocreales and Xylariales)\nrevealed that seed- and leaf-inhabiting fungi have a shared evolutionary\nhistory, yet differ in the prevalence, richness, and composition of\ntheir endohyphal symbionts. Phylogenetic analyses detected that the EHB\nhabit is widespread, here encompassing members of seven phyla of\nbacteria (including three classes of Proteobacteria). Occurring in seed-\nvs. leaf-associated fungi has not resulted in detectable structure in\nthe evolution of EHB, and no congruence was observed in the phylogenetic\nrelationships of these apparently facultative, horizontally transmitted\nsymbionts. Our results are consistent with multiple origins of\nfungus-bacterium associations and argue for evaluating focal pairs to\ndetermine how particular EHB affect the establishment or maintenance of\nfungal symbioses in seeds and leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Gliocladiopsis -
