K. Hsiao (Ranunculaceae) has\nbeen regarded as an imperfectly known species. Based on critical\nexamination of herbarium specimens and living plants we have determined\nthat it is a morphologically distinctive species and that its\ngeographical range is much wider than regarded before, far from locally\nendemic to its type locality. Our cytological examination reveals the\nspecies to be a diploid (2n = 16). Our molecular phylogenetic analyses\nusing nrDNA and cpDNA datasets confirm our morphological observations.\nAs the generic concept and delimitation of Actaea L., in which\nCimicifuga Wernisch. and Souliea Franch. are included, have also been\nstrongly corroborated by our molecular phylogenetic analyses, here we\nadopt a broad Actaea and make a new combination for the species in\nquestion, i.e.Â Actaea nanchuanensis (P. K. Hsiao) J. P. Luo, Q. Yuan\n& Q. E.
