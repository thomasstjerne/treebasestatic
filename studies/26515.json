Unlike\ntraditional taxonomic methods, DNA barcoding could be a promising tool\nfor the identification and conservation of Clerodendrum species. This\nstudy was attempted to develop an efficient barcode locus in\nClerodendrum species of North East India. We evaluated four barcode\ncandidates (ITS2, matK, rbcL, ycf1) and its combinations in different\nClerodendrum species. The reliability of barcodes to distinguish the\nspecies were calculated using genetic pairwise distances, intra- and\ninter- specific diversity, barcode gap, and phylogenetic tree-based\nmethods. The results exemplify that matK posses maximum number of\nvariables and parsimony-informative sites (103/100), intra-\n(0.021±0.001) and inter- (0.086±0.005) specific divergences and species\nresolution rate (89.1%) followed by ITS2, ycf1, and rbcL. Among the\ncombinatorial locus, ITS2+matK showed the best species discrimination\nwith distinctive barcode gaps. Therefore, we tentatively suggest that\nthe combination of ITS2+matK as core barcode for Clerodendrum and\nconverted into quick response (QR) code. Hence, this finding indicates\nthat DNA barcoding could provide consistent resources for species\ndiscrimination and resolve taxonomic controversies of the genus as well\nas set a preliminary assessment toward its biodiversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clerodendrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128304.phy"}]}
