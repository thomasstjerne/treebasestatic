However, it produces aflatoxin, a secondary\nmetabolite characteristic of some members of Aspergillus subgenus\nCircumdati section Flavi and sterigmatocystin, a related secondary\nmetabolite usually associated with Aspergillus subgenus Nidulantes\nsections Nidulantes and Versicolores, and members of several other\ngenera. Our morphological data supports the placement of A.\nochraceoroseus in subgenus Circumdati. Sequence data from A.\nochraceoroseus aflatoxin and sterigmatocystin genes aflR and nor-1/stcE,\nas well as 5.8S ITS and beta tubulin genes was compared to that of\naspergilli in sections Circumdati, Flavi, Nidulantes and Versicolores.\nIn the sequence comparisons, A. ochraceoroseus was more closely related\nto the species in subgenus Nidulantes than to species from subgenus\nCircumdati.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"nor-1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"aflR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PAUP 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5.8S ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PAUP 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5.8S ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4077.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PAUP 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5.8S ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PAUP 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5.8S ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"5.8S ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4080.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"beta tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4081.phy"}]}
