The expansion of commercially managed eucalypt\nplantations has chiefly been driven by their rapid growth and\nsuitability for propagation across a very wide variety of sites and\nclimatic conditions. Infection of foliar fungal pathogens of eucalypts\nis resulting in increasingly negative impacts on commercial forest\nindustries globally. To assist in evaluating this threat, the present\nstudy provides a global perspective on foliar pathogens of eucalypts. We\ntreat 110 different genera including species associated with foliar\ndisease symptoms of these hosts. The vast majority of these fungi have\nbeen grown in axenic culture, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis,\nresolving their phylogeny. During the course of this study several new\ngenera and species were encountered, and these are described. New genera\ninclude: Lembosiniella (L. eucalyptorum on E. dunnii, Australia),\nNeosonderhenia (N. eucalypti on E. costata, Australia), Neothyriopsis\n(N. sphaerospora on E. camaldulensis, South Africa), Neotrichosphaeria\n(N. eucalypticola on E. deglupta, Australia), Nothotrimmatostroma (N.\nbifarium on E. dalrympleana, Australia), Nowamyces (incl.Â Nowamycetaceae\nfam. nov., N. globulus on E. globulus, Australia), and Walkaminomyces\n(W. medusae on E. alba, Australia). New species include (all from\nAustralia): Disculoides fraxinoides on E. fraxinoides, Elsinoe piperitae\non E. piperita, Fusculina regnans on E. regnans, Marthamyces johnstonii\non E. dunnii, Neofusicoccum corticosae on E. corticosa,\nNeotrimmatostroma dalrympleanae on E. dalrympleana, Nowamyces piperitae\non E. piperita, Phaeothyriolum dunnii on E. dunnii, Pseudophloeospora\neucalyptigena on E. obliqua, Pseudophloeospora jollyi on Eucalyptus sp.,\nQuambalaria tasmaniae on Eucalyptus sp., Q. rugosae on E. rugosa,\nSonderhenia radiata on E. radiata, Teratosphaeria pseudonubilosa on E.\nglobulus and Thyrinula dunnii on E. dunnii. A new name is also proposed\nfor Heteroconium eucalypti as Thyrinula uruguayensis on E. dunnii,\nUruguay. Although many of these genera and species are commonly\nassociated with disease problems, several appear to be opportunists\ndeveloping on stressed or dying tissues. For the majority of these\nfungi, pathogenicity remains to be determined. This represents an\nimportant goal for forest pathologists and biologists in the future.\nConsequently, this study will promote renewed interest in foliar\npathogens of eucalypts, leading to investigations that will provide an\nimproved understanding of the biology of these fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 40.
