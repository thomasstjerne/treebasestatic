In addition, species of\nthe family are often among the most common in Neotropical forests,\nespecially in the Amazon Basin. We used combined datasets derived from\nthe ndhF and trnL-F genes to elucidate relationships of genera in both\nthe Old and New Worlds that have been associated with Lecythidaceae. Our\nwork agrees with the recognition of the Napoleonaeaceae,\nScytopetalaceae, and Lecythidaceae as separate families. Within the\nLecythidaceae there is support for recognizing the following three\nsubfamilies: Foetidioideae, Planchonioideae, and Lecythidoideae. We then\nfocused on genera of the latter subfamily and found support for\nrecognizing Grias, Gustavia, Corythophora, Couratari, Couroupita; but\nconclude that Allantoma, Cariniana, Lecythis, and Eschweilera were not\nmonoyphyletic. Because the position of Bertholletia excelsa in relation\nto the other zygomorphic-flowered genera was not resolved, we are not\nable to comment on its generic status.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecythidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2598.phy"}]}
