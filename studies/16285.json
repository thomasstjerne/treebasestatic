These strains are described here as a new species following a\nmultigene phylogenetic analyses of four loci, nuc rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer barcodes (ITS1  5.8S  ITS2), β-tubulin, calmodulin,\nand RNA polymerase II, and observation of macro- and micromorphological\ncharacters. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the three strains formed a\nstrongly supported monophyletic group distinct from previously reported\nspecies of section Aspergilloides. Morphologically, this species can be\ndistinguished from its sister species, P. crocicola, by the reverse\ncolour on Czapek yeast autolysate agar, abundant production of sclerotia\non malt extract agar, and colony characters on yeast extract sucrose\nagar. We name this new species P. jejuense, after the locality where it\nwas discovered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium RPB ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77248.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium combined (benA+cmd+RPB) ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77246.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium ITS ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77247.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium benA ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium cmd ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77249.phy"}]}
