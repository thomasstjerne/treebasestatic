In this\nstudy, we reconstructed a broad-scale phylogeny containing Titanotrichum\nusing gene sequences from four sequence regions (chloroplast trnL-F\nintron and spacer and atpB-rbcL spacer, nuclear 26S ribosomal DNA, and\nthe low-copy developmental gene CYCLOIDEA, CYC). The phylogenies\ninferred from each individual data set and the combined data are\ncongruent in placing Titanotrichum inside Gesneriaceae. The phylogenetic\ntree based on combined chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences grouped\nTitanotrichum with subfamilies Gesnerioideae (New World) and\nCoronantheroideae (South Pacific and Chile). We have isolated CYC, from\nmost of the represented species of Gesneriaceae and Scrophulariaceae,\nand this gene phylogeny suggests the same placement of Titanotrichum.\nCYC was found to evolve three times faster than the trnL-F intron and\nspacer, 3.3 times faster than the atpB-rbcL spacer, and eight times\nfaster than nuclear 26S rDNA. Although there is considerable\nphylogenetic information in this fast evolving gene, analysis is\nproblematic because of high levels of homoplasy and paralogy. In\naddition to a duplication predating a split between New World and Old\nWorld taxa (Gcyc1 vs.Â Gcyc2), there are several subsequent\nlineage-related duplications (mainly within Gcyc1).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tita 26S","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5831.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5828.phy"},{"tree_label":"atpB MP","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5829.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tita trnL","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5827.phy"},{"tree_label":"atpB ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5830.phy"},{"tree_label":"26S ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5832.phy"},{"tree_label":"CYC ML","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5833.phy"},{"tree_label":"TITACYC MP","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5834.phy"},{"tree_label":"TITACYC PROT","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5835.phy"},{"tree_label":"3gene combined","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5836.phy"},{"tree_label":"combined ML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Titanotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5837.phy"}]}
