One of these\ncomprises Didynamipus, Nectophrynoides, Nectophryne, Werneria,\nWolterstofina, Laurentophryne and two Scuth African species that were\nuntil recently referred to Bulo. The characteristics distinguishing this\nassemblage from the others are stated and a diagnosis of Didynamipus\ngiven. For each of 24 characters the evolutionary direction of change is\ninferred. From an analysis of the derived character states a\nphylogenetic hypothesis is constructed that suggests that Didynamipus is\nmore closely related to West African Nectophrynoides than to any of the\nCameroun genera Nectophryne is considered the most advanced genus in the\nassemblage. It is further suggested that the assemblage to which\nDidynamipus belongs is no more distant from Australian myobatrachids\nthan from other African bufonids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectophryne line","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5505.phy"}]}
