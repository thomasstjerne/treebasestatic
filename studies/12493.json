Dinoflagellate monophyly and their position within the group\nAlveolata are well established. However, phylogenetic relationships\nbetween dinoflagellate orders remain unresolved. To date, only a limited\nnumber of dinoflagellate studies have used a broad taxon sample with\nmore than two concatenated markers. This lack of resolution makes it\ndifficult to determine the evolution of major phenotypic characters such\nas morphological features or toxin production e.g.Â saxitoxin. Here we\npresent an improved dinoflagellate phylogeny, based on eight genes, with\nthe broadest taxon sampling to date. Fifty-five sequences for eight\nphylogenetic markers from nuclear and mitochondrial regions were\namplified from 13 species, four orders, and concatenated phylogenetic\ninferences were conducted with orthologous sequences. Phylogenetic\nresolution is increased with addition of support for the deepest\nbranches, though can be improved yet further. We show for the first time\nthat the characteristic dinoflagellate thecal plates, cellulosic\nmaterial that is present within the sub-cuticular alveoli, appears to\nhave had a single origin. In addition, the monophyly of most\ndinoflagellate orders is confirmed: the Dinophysiales, the\nGonyaulacales, the Prorocentrales, the Suessiales, and the Syndiniales.\nOur improved phylogeny, along with results of PCR to detect the sxtA\ngene in various lineages, allows us to suggest that this gene was\nprobably acquired separately in Gymnodinium and the common ancestor of\nAlexandrium and Pyrodinium and subsequently lost in some descendent\nspecies of Alexandrium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56419.phy"},{"tree_label":"S4","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56423.phy"},{"tree_label":"S5","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56424.phy"},{"tree_label":"S6","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56425.phy"},{"tree_label":"S7","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56426.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 nr mt","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56421.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56422.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 rn","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56420.phy"},{"tree_label":"S9","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56428.phy"},{"tree_label":"S10","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56429.phy"},{"tree_label":"S8","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56427.phy"},{"tree_label":"S11","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinoflagellates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56430.phy"}]}
