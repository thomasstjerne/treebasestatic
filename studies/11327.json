Gagnep.\nInterestingly, the triploid and most diploid strains had variably\nreduced pollen fertility. Two questions emerged from this earlier work:\n(1) How do triploids arise, and are they allotriploids or autotriploids?\nand (2) Why is there low pollen fertility in some diploid plants? We\nused a molecular genetic approach to determine the phylogenetic origins\nof triploids in C. japonica and the closely related species Cayratia\ntenuifolia (Wight & Arn.) Gagnep. In our analysis, we compared the\nsequences of the nuclear single-copy genes LEAFY and ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1.\nAs a result, most triploids and diploids were heterozygous for the loci\nexamined; the triploid genome shared an allele with the diploid genome,\nbut other alleles differed between the ploidies. Therefore, Japanese\npopulations of C. japonica and C. tenuifolia almost certainly arose from\nrepeated hybridization events among genetically differentiated strains.\nUsing our sequence data, we discuss possible scenarios accounting for\nthe occurrence of triploids in the two species of Cayratia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31377","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31377.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31376","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31376.phy"}]}
