We report at least three extant species. Two widely\ndistributed species, L. boryana and L. raphanica comb. nov., are\ndiscussed in this paper, and a new species is being described elsewhere.\nThe geographic ranges of both species apparently overlap throughout\ntropical and subtropical America except for the Gulf Coast region of the\nUnited States, from which only L. raphanica can be reported. Lentinula\nboryana and L. raphanica differ in basidiome micromorphology, especially\ncheilocystidial form, spore dimensions, sexual compatibility profiles,\nand ITS sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lentinula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5550.phy"}]}
