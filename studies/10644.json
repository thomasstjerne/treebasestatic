Many morphological characteristics routinely used to\ndescribe species overlap in Neofusicoccum, and prior to the use of\nmolecular phylogenetics, isolates from different hosts and locations\nwere often misidentified. Two cryptic species N. ribis and N. parvum\nwere initially described from different continents and recently another\nfour species within this complex were described using fixed nucleotide\npolymorphisms for differentiation. During a survey of eucalypt cankers\nin eastern Australia, a collection of morphologically similar\nNeofusioccum isolates were obtained. This collection was analysed within\nthe framework of the morphological, ecological and phylogenetic species\nrecognition concepts. Morphological data based on spore measurements,\ntogether with pathogenicity trials were considered alongside molecular\nanalysis, which included multiple gene phylogenies constructed from four\nnuclear gene regions. We also used the Genealogical Sorting Index\nstatistic to provide evidence for the status of terminal taxa in the\nphylogenetic analysis. Isolates examined, exhibited overlapping\nmorphological and culture characteristics, similar pathogenicity to\nexcised stems and shared hosts within the same locations. Phylogenetic\nanalysis separated isolates into 8 clades corresponding to six described\nspecies: N. ribis, N. parvum, N. kwambonambiense, N. cordaticola, N.\numdonicola, N. batangarum, and two new clades. GSI support indicated\ncombined phylogenetic data was monophyletic for all clades and all\np-values were significant allowing us to reject the null hypothesis that\nall groups were from a single mixed group. Consequently the description\nof Neofusicoccum occulatum is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RPB2 bayesian","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19957.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF bootstrap","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19953.phy"},{"tree_label":"combinedbootstrap","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19959.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS bootstrap","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19944.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 bootstrap","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19956.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS bayesian","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19945.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT bayesian","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19951.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF parsimony","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19952.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF bayesian","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19954.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 parsimony","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19955.phy"},{"tree_label":"combinedparsimony","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19958.phy"},{"tree_label":"combinedbayesian","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19960.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19943.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT parsimony","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19949.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT bootstrap","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ribis-parvum complex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_19950.phy"}]}
