Traditionally placed in its\nown subfamily and regarded as sister group to Culicinae, recent\nmorphological data instead have suggested that this distinctive genus\nbelongs well within the Culicinae. Published molecular systematic\nstudies seemingly conflict with this new morphological data or are\nambiguous. The mitochondrial gene data that we present show good\npotential for elucidating suprageneric relationships in Culicidae, and\nstrongly support the placement of Toxorhynchites well within the\nCulicinae. Reexamination of published data sets suggests that there is\nno substantive conflict among data sets on this issue.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosquitoes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1184.phy"}]}
