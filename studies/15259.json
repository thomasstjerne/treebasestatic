To explore the plant beneficial characteristics and\nrhizosphere interactions of SQR9, complete genome sequence and\ntranscriptomic analysis response to maize root exudates were performed.\nResults: The complete genome sequence of B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9\nrevealed numerous functional genes related to suppression of plant\npathogens and promotion of plant growth, indicating the potential for\nproduction of novel anti-bacterial chemicals. Root exudates stimulated\nbiofilm formation of SQR9 in liquid culture. The RNA-sequencing based on\ntranscriptional profiling of SQR9 response to maize root exudates under\nstatic conditions indicated that most of the regulated genes belonged to\nintermediary metabolism, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, cell\nmotility and chemotaxis, biofilm formation and synthesis of secondary\nmetabolites with antimicrobial action. It was found that plenty of the\nsignificant genes were involved in rhizosphere adaptation and plant\nbeneficial. Conclusions: The complete genome sequence and transcriptome\nanalysis reported here provide useful information for understanding\nplant-rhizobacteria interactions and hence for promoting the\nagricultural applications of this plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria\n(PGPR) strain, such as applied as bio-organic fertilizer or a biocontrol\nagents for suppression of soil-borne diseases.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70187","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70187.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70185.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70181.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70180.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70191.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70189.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70188","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70188.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70186","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70186.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70184.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70183.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70182.phy"}]}
