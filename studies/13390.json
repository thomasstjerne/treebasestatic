Pluteus\nglaucotinctus sensu stricto is known only from the type collection\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo), which is re-examined here. Four\nother species are recognized in this complex and described herein as\nnew: P. izurun from Spain, P. meridionalis from Brazil, P. padanilus\nfrom India and P. thoenii from Africa. Phylogenetic analyses based on\nnrITS + tef1 sequence data support the recognition of all species in\nthis complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus glaucotinctus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus glaucotinctus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus glaucotinctus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69352.phy"}]}
