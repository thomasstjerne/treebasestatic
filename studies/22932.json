The generic type of Hydnophanerochaete is Phanerochaete\nodontoidea. Odontoefibula is established based on a new species: O.\norientalis (generic type). Both genera have effused basidiocarps with\nodontioid hymenial surface, simple-septate generative hyphae, cystidia\nlacking, clavate basidia, and ellipsoid basidiospores that are smooth,\nthin-walled, inamyloid, non-dextrinoid, and acyanophilous.\nHydnophanerochaete is additionally characterized by a compact texture in\nsubiculum with thick-walled generative hyphae and presence of\nquasi-binding hyphae. Also, Odontoefibula has a dense texture of\nsubiculum with thin- to slightly thick-walled hyphae and further a\ndark-reddish reaction of basidiocarps when treated with KOH. Multi-gene\nphylogenetic analyses based on sequences inferred from the ITS+nuc\n28S+rpb1+rpb2+tef1 dataset indicate that Hydnophanerochaete and\nOdontoefibula are placed in Meruliaceae and Donkia clade of\nPhanerochaetaceae, respectively. Phanerochaete subodontoidea is a\nsynonym of P. odontoidea, according to morphological and molecular\nevidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113352","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113352.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113353.phy"}]}
