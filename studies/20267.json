We investigated\nthe mechanisms behind the high diversity in this species. We acquired\nITS sequence data across the distribution range of the genus,\nreconstructed dated phylogenies, projected the resulting clades onto\ngeographic maps and linked the results with inferred ploidy levels of\nthe populations. We found strong geographic patterns for the ITS clades\nbut with extensively overlapping ranges, particularly in the Hengduan\nMountains area. We deduced an origin of C. lanuginosus in the mid\nOligocene. We used the presence of ITS polymorphisms to infer a high\nlevel of hybridization events mainly in areas of clade overlap, where we\nalso inferred repeated tetraploidization events to have taken place.\nPre- and post-Quaternary climate oscillation-driven expansions and\ncontractions of distribution ranges have allowed secondary contacts,\nhybridization and introgression that shaped the current patchy\ndistribution of morphological diversity in the species. Polyploidization\nas a reinforcing genetic barrier added to the genetic diversity in space\nand time particularly in the Hengduan Mountains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100342","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100342.phy"}]}
