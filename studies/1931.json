The phylogeny includes all but two of the currently\n87 recognized species of the genus. The analysis is based on a total of\n222 phylogenetically informative characters derived from nucleotide\nsequence data from three protein-coding (ndhF, accD, rpoC1) and two\nnon-coding (trnH-psbA, rpl36-rps8) plastid regions. The phylogenetic\nhypothesis is in conflict with the primary classification of Mathew into\nsubgenera and sections. Most notably by placing the highly\nmorphologically deviant C. banaticus (subgenus Crociris), not as sister\ngroup to subgenus Crocus, but imbedded within it. The grouping of the\ntaxa into series is better supported, though not entirely. Of the 15\nseries recognized by Mathew, eight are confirmed as being monophyletic,\nmonophyly of one more remains a possibility, and monophyly of a further\ntwo series is only violated by one taxon. Not unexpectedly, the two most\nspecies rich groups, series Reticulati and series Biflori encompassing\nalmost 1/3 of all species, are clearly non-monophyletic, but the present\ndata do not satisfactorily solve their phylogenetic relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crocus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2916.phy"}]}
