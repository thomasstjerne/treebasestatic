Morphologically it resembles\nDeniquelata barringtoniae but obviously distinct in having larger\nascomatal, asci and ascospore dimensions, brown ascospores (with 35\ntransverse septa. Further phylogenetic analyses inferred from combined\nLSU, SSU and ITS dataset indicate that Deniquelata vittalii share a\nsister relation with D. barringtoniae with higher statistical support\nand form a strongly supported monophyletic clade. Both morphological\ndifferences and DNA based sequence data strongly supports the\nestablishment of our new taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110507","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110507.phy"}]}
