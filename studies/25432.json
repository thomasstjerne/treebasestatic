In this study,\nthree fresh strains were isolated from Spiraea salicifolia in Beijing,\nChina. Both morphological observation and multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalyses (ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tub2) suggest the position of the new\nspecies in Nothophoma, which forms a monophyletic lineage with strong\nsupport. Nothophoma spiraeae sp. nov. is characterized by having dense\nand fluffy colony, producing abundant pycnidia with aseptate conidia,\nand differs from its relatives in sequence data and by host\nassociation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121658.phy"}]}
