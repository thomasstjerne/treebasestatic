Insertion sequences were found in the nuSSU of all isolates\n(e.g., nine insertions in the strain JCM 5358), some of which were group\nI introns. Five new insertion positions were found among the D. alba\nisolates. Using BLAST, none of the insertion sequences of D. alba were\nclosely related to those of fungi or other organisms deposited in public\nDNA databases. Insertion positions were similar in some isolates, and\ntwo positions were common to all isolates. Although all phylogenetic\nanalyses based on nuSSU, nuLSU, and ITS revealed the monophyly of D.\nalba, the isolates were divided into two (in the nuSSU tree) or three\n(in the nuLSU and ITS trees) groups. Based on the phylogenetic analyses\nand the intron-exon structures, the five isolates identified as D. alba\nbelong to three cryptic species and therefore D. alba should be\nconsidered a species complex. The very slow-growing, tough agar colonies\nof the isolates, the occurrence of the species on both slightly\nlichenized and non-lichenized surfaces of trees, or pebbles (rarely on\nsoil), suggest that the members of the D. alba complex may be\nlichenized. The photobiont was not clearly identified in this\nstudy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Default symmetrical","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57334.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default bush","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57335","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default ladder","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57336.phy"},{"tree_label":"ssu","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyocatenulata alba SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50975.phy"},{"tree_label":"lsu","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyocatenulata alba LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50976.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default symmetrical","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57337","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57337.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyocatenulata alba ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50979.phy"}]}
