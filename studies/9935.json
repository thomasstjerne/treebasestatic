The objective of this study\nwas to make progress toward meeting these requirements in the\nevolutionarily complex subtribe Machaerantherinae. The 5S ribosomal RNA\n(rRNA) spacer was investigated to characterize its structure and\nvariation. Analysis of the spacer supported relationships that were\nmostly the same as those supported by ITS and ETS sequence data. Two\nmethods were used to estimate support for 11 occurrences of incongruence\nbetween 5S/ITS/ETS and cpDNA datasets. The best-supported examples were\nused to construct reticulate phylogenies, which hypothesized reticulate\nhistories for five species and groups. For three of them, 5S and ITS/ETS\nevidence supported the same or similar relationships, indicating that\nthese two regions of the nuclear genome were descended from the same\nancestor or from two closely related ancestors, with cpDNA coming from a\nmore distantly related ancestor. 5S and ITS/ETS evidence disagreed on\nthe relationships of Arida riparia, suggesting that its ITS/ETS region\nhas come from one ancestor, and its 5S region and cpDNA from a different\nancestor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Machaerantherinae, 5S reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6492.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Machaerantherinae, 5S complete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6275.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Machaerantherinae, 5S ADX","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6012.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Machaerantherinae, 5S combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6534.phy"}]}
