B. ecuadorensis is characterised by dark gray to black pore\nsurface, a monomitic hyphal system and hyaline to yellowish-brown\ngenerative hyphae, ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 3.94.5 × 2.73 μm.\nB. fulgida is distinguished from the other species in the genus by clay\nbuff to pale brown and glancing pore surface. B. minispora is\ncharacterised by white tomentose pore mouth and small basidiospores\nmeasuring 3.14.2 × 22.8 μm. B. resupinata is characterised by resupinate\nbasidiocarps, pinkish buff to pale brownish pore surface, ellipsoid to\nbroadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.56 × 3.24.1 µm. The closely\nrelated taxa to four new species are discussed. An identification key to\nten accepted species of Bjerkandera is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bjerkandera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132211.phy"}]}
