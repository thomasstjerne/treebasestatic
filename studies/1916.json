Based on its phylogeny of the 28S rDNA (LSU) gene, the\ngenus Aplosporella represents yet another anamorph lineage within the\nBotryosphaeriaceae (Botryosphaeriales). Aplosporella is characterized by\nhaving multilocular conidiomata opening by a single ostiole, verrucose,\nbrown conidia, and the presence of prominent paraphyses. Details\npertaining to the pathogenicity and host specificity of Aplosporella\nspp., remain to be elucidated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aplosporella prunicola, Distance tree using HKY85 on\nLSU alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4976.phy"}]}
