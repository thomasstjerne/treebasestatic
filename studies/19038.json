Although\nendophytic fungi are abundant and diverse in many biomes, they reach\ntheir greatest diversity in tropical forests. However, turnover in\nendophyte communities among tropical forests has not been evaluated in\ndetail, limiting inferences regarding the scale of tropical fungal\ndiversity and contributions of endophytes to global estimates of fungal\nspecies richness. Endophytic fungal communities associated with common\nspecies of eupolypod ferns were compared in forest reserves in Panama,\nCosta Rica, and Mexico. Molecular sequence data for >2000 isolates\nwere used to determine the relative contributions of host taxonomy,\nforest (site), and environmental dissimilarity to endophyte community\ncomposition. Endophyte communities differed significantly among fern\nspecies within sites, and among related ferns in three forests. These\ndifferences reflected both geographic distance and environmental\ndissimilarity among sites. Phylogenetic reconstructions corroborate\nfindings of high beta diversity at the species level. Linking\nspecies-level patterns of biodiversity to a geographical, environmental,\nand evolutionary context provides a new perspective on the scope of\nendophyte diversity and the potential impacts of endophytes on tropical\nplant ecology.
