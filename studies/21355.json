This paper\nprovides the first DNA sequences of Boletus rubricitrinus, a common\nFlorida bolete often found in lawns under Quercus, and likely has a\ndistribution that extends to Texas. Based on ITS and LSU sequences and\nmorphological studies we propose moving it to the genus Pulchroboletus.\nAs the holotype is in poor condition, an epitype is established here. A\nthorough description of macroscopic and microscopic features is also\nprovided for the species. These molecular and morphological data will be\nuseful to further improve our understanding of bolete taxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pulchroboletus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121427.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pulchroboletus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121426.phy"}]}
