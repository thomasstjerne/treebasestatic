In cooperation with the greenhouses, one or more of\ntheir water tanks were monitored continuously (128 tank samplings) for\nPythium by baiting. Nine species of Pythium and three species of\nPhytopythium were recovered, representing Clades A, B, E, and K but none\nwas P. aphanidermatum. The recovered Pythium species were: 1) P.\nrostratifingens, 2) isolates identical to P. sp. nov. OOMYA1702-08\n(Clade B2), 3) P. coloratum, 4) P. middletonii, 5) and 6) two new\nspecies in Clade E2, 7) a new species in Clade B2, 8) isolates very\nsimilar to P. sp. nov. OOMYA1646-08 (Clade E2), and 9) a new species in\nClade A. The Phytopythium species recovered were: 1) Ph. litorale, 2)\nPh. helicoides, and 3) Ph. chamaehyphon. This paper illustrates the\ndifferent communities of Pythium and Phytopythium species found in each\ngreenhouse over ten months. Some of the baited species display\nresistance to the Oomycete fungicide active ingredient, mefenoxam. Ph.\nhelicoides and the new species in Clade B2 were pathogenic on seedlings\nin potting mix with fertilizer added.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium ITS and cox1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89100.phy"}]}
