Here, we describe a previously unidentified basal\ntheropod, reassess its contemporary Eoraptor as a basal sauropodomorph,\ndivide the faunal record of the Ischigualasto Formation with biozones,\nand bracket the formation with 40Ar / 39Ar ages. Some 230 million years\nago in the Late Triassic (mid Carnian), the earliest dinosaurs were the\ndominant terrestrial carnivores and small herbivores in southwestern\nPangaea. The extinction of nondinosaurian herbivores is sequential and\nis not linked to an increase in dinosaurian diversity, which weakens the\npredominant scenario for dinosaurian ascendancy as opportunistic\nreplacement.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinosauromorpha Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55339.phy"}]}
