However, due\nto a rather deviant morphology their taxonomic affinity has not been\nclarified. Authors have proposed an origin from three possible species,\nViola alba, V. odorata or V. suavis, or a hybrid origin. We have\ngenerated and analyzed two independent data sets for several Parma\nViolet cultivars and numerous accessions of related taxa, the first one\nbased on ITS sequence variation, and the second on allozymic variation\nin 14 putative loci. Both data sets showed that the Parma Violet\ncultivars have their origin within Viola alba and that they are best\nincluded in the Mediterranean ssp. dehnhardtii. There was no trace of\ninterspecific hybridization. However, the cultivars appeared to have a\nsingle origin in a wide hybrid within V. alba, involving parental plants\nfrom the eastern and western Mediterranean region; historical literature\nsources seem to indicate Turkey and Italy, respectively. The\ninvestigated Parma Violet cultivars possessed high levels of allozyme\nheterozygosity, and to some extent also within-individual ITS sequence\nvariation. Losses of heterozygosity and within- individual ITS sequence\nvariation in some of the cultivars indicate subsequent rare events of\nsexual reproduction, presumably through cleistogamous seed-set.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Viola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_758.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Viola without Parma violets","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_759.phy"}]}
