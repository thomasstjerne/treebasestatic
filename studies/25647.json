Colletotrichum spp. are economically\nimportant but taxonomically un-resolved. Identification of\nColletotrichum spp. is critical due to potential species-level\ndifferences in pathogenicity-related characteristics. A 400-isolate\ncollection from NewYork apple orchards were morphologically assorted to\ntwo groups, C. acutatum species complex (CASC) and C. gloeosporioides\nspecies complex (CGSC). A sub-sample of 44 representative isolates,\nspanning the geographical distribution and apple varieties, were\nassigned to species based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses of nrITS,\nGAPDH and TUB2 for CASC, and ITS, GAPDH, CAL, ACT, TUB2, APN2, ApMat and\nGS genes for CGSC. The dominant species was C. fioriniae, followed by C.\nchrysophilum and a novel species, C. noveboracense, described in this\nstudy. This study represents the first report of C. chrysophilum and C.\nnoveboracense as pathogens of apple. We assessed the enzyme activity and\nfungicide sensitivity for isolates identified in NewYork. All isolates\nshowed amylolytic, cellulolytic and lipolytic, but not proteolytic\nactivity. C. chrysophilum showed the highest cellulase and the lowest\nlipase activity, while C. noveboracense had the highest amylase\nactivity. Fungicide assays showed that C. fioriniae was sensitive to\nbenzovindiflupyr and thiabendazole, while C. chrysophilum and C.\nnoveboracense were sensitive to fludioxonil, pyraclostrobin and\ndifenoconazole. All species were pathogenic on apple fruit with varying\nlesion sizes. Our findings of differing pathogenicity- related\ncharacteristics among the three species demonstrate the importance of\naccurate species identification for any downstream investigations of\nColletotrichum spp. in major apple growing regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum actin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121487.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum cal","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121491.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum gapdh","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121492.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum gs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121494.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum its","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121495.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"178","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121497.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum acutatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121498.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum overall its","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121499.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum apn2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121489.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum apmat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124992.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum multilocus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124993.phy"}]}
