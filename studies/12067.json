We discuss species limits of R. terminalis and provide a key\nthat distinguishes it from close relatives including R. grantii, R.\noaxacana, and R. phyllocalyx. Ruellia puri is placed into synonymy with\nR. jussieuoides, and R. standleyi is synonymized with R. ochroleuca.\nDisjunct distributions characterize R. terminalis, R. jussieuoides, and\nR. ochroleuca, although most extreme in R. ochroleuca. New\nlectotypifications are provided for Arrhostoxylum achimeniflorum and\nLychniothyrsus ochroleucus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML BEST","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruellia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49299.phy"}]}
