However, differential rates of change and the evolutionary\nmechanisms driving those rates result in pervasive phylogenetic\nconflict. These drivers need to be uncovered because mismatches between\nevolutionary processes and phylogenetic models can lead to high\nconfidence in incorrect hypotheses. Incongruence between phylogenies\nderived from morphological versus molecular analyses, and between trees\nbased on different subsets of molecular sequences has become pervasive\nas datasets have expanded rapidly in both characters and species. For\nmore than a decade, evolutionary relationships among members of the New\nWorld bat family Phyllostomidae inferred from morphological and\nmolecular data have been in conflict. Here, we develop and apply methods\nto minimize systematic biases, uncover the biological mechanisms\nunderlying phylogenetic conflict, and outline data requirements for\nfuture phylogenomic and morphological data collection. We introduce new\nmorphological data for phyllostomids and outgroups and expand previous\nmolecular analyses to eliminate methodological sources of phylogenetic\nconflict such as taxonomic sampling, sparse character sampling, or use\nof different algorithms to estimate the phylogeny. We also evaluate the\nimpact of biological sources of conflict: saturation in morphological\nchanges and molecular substitutions, and other processes that result in\nincongruent trees, including convergent morphological and molecular\nevolution. Methodological sources of incongruence play some role in\ngenerating phylogenetic conflict, and are relatively easy to eliminate\nby matching taxa, collecting more characters, and applying the same\nalgorithms to optimize phylogeny. The evolutionary patterns uncovered\nare consistent with multiple biological sources of conflict, including\nsaturation in morphological and molecular changes, adaptive\nmorphological convergence among nectar-feeding lineages, and incongruent\ngene trees. Applying methods to account for nucleotide sequence\nsaturation reduces, but does not completely eliminate, phylogenetic\nconflict. We ruled out paralogy, lateral gene transfer, and poor taxon\nsampling and outgroup choices among the processes leading to incongruent\ngene trees in phyllostomid bats. Uncovering and countering the possible\neffects of introgression and lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism\non gene trees will require great leaps in genomic and allelic sequencing\nin this species-rich mammalian family. We also found evidence for\nadaptive molecular evolution leading to convergence in mitochondrial\nproteins among nectar-feeding lineages. In conclusion, the biological\nprocesses that generate phylogenetic conflict are ubiquitous, and\novercoming incongruence requires better models and more data than have\nbeen collected even in well-studied organisms such as phyllostomid\nbats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Wetterer et al 2000 MP","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree generated as part of
