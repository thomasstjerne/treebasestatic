One driver of\nthis diversity is the evolution of host-species specificity, which can\noccur via reproductive isolation following a host-switch or, given the\ncorrect circumstances, via cospeciation. In this study, we explored the\ndiversity and evolutionary history of Acrostichus nematodes that are\nassociated with halictid bees in North America. First, we conducted\nsurveys of bees in Virginia, and found six halictid species that host\nAcrostichus. To test the hypothesis of cospeciation, we constructed\nphylogenetic hypotheses of Acrostichus based on three genes. We found\nAcrostichus puri and Acrostichus halicti to be species complexes\ncomprising cryptic, host-specific species. Although several nodes in the\nhost and symbiont phylogenies were congruent and tests for cospeciation\nwere significant, the hosts biogeography, the apparent patchiness of the\nassociation across the hosts phylogeny, and the amount of evolution in\nthe nematode sequence suggested a mixture of cospeciation, host\nswitching, and extinction events instead of strict cospeciation.\nCospeciation can explain the relationships between Ac. puri and its\naugochlorine hosts, but colonization of Halictus hosts is more likely\nthan cospeciation. The nematodes are vertically transmitted, but sexual\ntransmission is also likely. Both of these transmission modes may\nexplain host-species specificity and congruent bee and nematode\nphylogenies. Additionally, all halictid hosts come from eusocial or\nsocially polymorphic lineages, suggesting that sociality may be a factor\nin the suitability of hosts for Acrostichus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58300.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58298.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58299.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58302.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58304.phy"},{"tree_label":"con_50_majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58303.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58297.phy"},{"tree_label":"con_50_majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematodes Associated with Sweat Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58301.phy"}]}
