Taxonomy of the penguin\nlice has been revised several times including the erection of the genus,\nCesareus, to contain some of the penguin chewing louse species.\nAdditionally, other groups of species within Austrogoniodes have been\nproposed. We constructed a phylogeny for all the chewing lice\nparasitising penguins from 46 parsimony informative morphological\ncharacters and found support for two groups within Austrogoniodes but\nlittle support for the Cesareus genus. Austrogoniodes metoecus, the only\nAustrogoniodes species parasitising a bird other than a penguin, was\nbasal in the phylogeny which suggested that if A. metoecus did originate\nfrom a louse species parasitising penguins, the host switching event was\nunlikely to have been recent. A superficial comparison of louse and\npenguin phylogenies identified some potential instances of cospeciation.\nHowever, a full analysis of cophylogenetic relationships between\npenguins and their lice awaits the publication of a better resolved\npenguin phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1744.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1747.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1745.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1746.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice, majority rule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1742.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"penguin-chewing lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1743.phy"}]}
