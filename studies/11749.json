It is compared with other species in the\ngenus differing in ascospore measurements, ascospores that are\nthick-walled, 1-3-septate, fusoid to lunate, with central brown cells\nand subhyaline end cells and without mucilaginous sheaths. Asci are\ncylindrical, pedicellate, with a distinct, wedge-shaped, non-amyloid\napical ring. Phylogenetic relationship of the novel fungus based on the\ncombined partial 18S and 28S rDNA placed in the same clade as A.\nvelatisporus (as the type species of the genus), A. hongkongensis and A.\nnilensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Annulatascus aquatorba","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47694.phy"}]}
