Both taxa are were\ncollected as saprobes on decaying wood of Avicennia marina, a common\nmangrove species found near Kaveri River Delta, Tamil Nadu, on the east\ncoast of India. Thyridariella is diagnosed by having an exclusive\ncombination of characters, such as ascomata with ostiolar necks\nthickened laterally, hyaline, centrally constricted muriform ascospores\nwith a single longitudinal septum in each segment and surrounded by a\nmucilaginous sheath. These characters demarcate these taxa from\nmorphologically similar genera such as Halojulella and Julella. In\naddition, the new genus also differs from Parathyridaria and Thyridaria\nin having hyaline, muriform ascospores with distinct mucilaginous\nsheaths. The monophyly of Thyridariella is well-supported in athe\nphylogenetic analysis based on a concatenated dataset from two proteins\nand three nuclear gene regions. The phylogeny also depicts a sister\ngroup relationship of our new genus to Parathyridaria and Thyridaria and\nhence confirms its position within Thyridariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110034.phy"}]}
