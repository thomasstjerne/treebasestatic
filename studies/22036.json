They have annual to\nperennial, mostly resupinate basidiocarps with more or less greyish\nfresh pores, an indistinct subiculum, lacking any kind of setae,\nbrownish, thick-walled basidiospores, and cause a white rot. The\ndistinctive morphological characters of the new species and their\nrelated species are discussed. Phylogenies based on the nuclear large\nsubunit rDNA (nLSU) gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region\nshow the three new species formed three distinct lineages in the\nFomitiporella clade. A key to known species of Fomitiporella is\ngiven.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110629.phy"}]}
