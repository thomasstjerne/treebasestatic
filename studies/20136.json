The new species Phytophthora acaciae is formally named herein\nbased on phylogenetic and morphological analysis. This is the fourth\nPhytophthora species found from this pathogen complex in black wattle\nplantations causing gummosis in Brazil. The other three species are P.\nnicotianae, P. boehmeriae, and P. frigida. Phytophthora acaciae is\nheterothallic with amphigynous antheridia, non-caducous, papillate\nsporangia, and is placed in the Phytophthora clade 2 based on internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) sequences. Maximum parsimony\nphylogenetic analyses of P. acaciae isolates based on multigene\nsequences, including partial DNA sequences of three nuclear\nprotein-coding genes (β-tubulin, translation elongation factor-1α, and\nras-related protein), two mitochondrial protein-coding genes (cytochrome\nc oxidase subunits I and II), in addition to ITS sequence data, support\nthe delimitation of this new species on Acacia mearnsii from the other\npreviously described clade 2 Phytophthora species. Pathogenicity trial\nconfirmed that the new species causes necrotic lesions on the plant\nstem, with either the presence or absence of gum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora betaTUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115036.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora COXI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115040.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora betaTUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115038.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115044.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora RAS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115049.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora RAS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115048.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora RAS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115047.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora IR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115043.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora COXI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115039.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora COXII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115041.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora EF1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115042.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora RAS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115046.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora RAS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115045.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora betaTUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115037.phy"}]}
