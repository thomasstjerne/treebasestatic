Based on molecular and morphological\ndata, 77 species are accepted in Xylodon to date. Phylogenetic analyses\nof ITS and 28S sequences, including 38 new ITS and 20 28S sequences of\nXylodon species, revealed four species new to science. The new taxa X.\nexilis, X. filicinus, X. follis and X. pseudolanatus from Taiwan, Nepal,\nRÃ©union, Belize, and USA are described and illustrated. In addition,\nspecies concepts for Odontia vesiculosa from New Zealand and Xylodon\nlanatus from U.S.A. are revised and the new name X. vesiculosus is\nproposed. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS region placed X. spathulatus,\nX. bubalinus and X. chinensis in a strongly supported clade and\ndemonstrated that they are conspecific. Palifer and Odontiopsis are\nsynonymised under Xylodon based on morphological and sequence data. The\nfollowing new combinations are proposed: X. erikssonii, X. gamundiae, X.\nhjortstamii, X. hyphodontinus, X. septocystidiatus and X. verecundus.\nLine drawings of X. cystidiatus, X. hyphodontinus, X. lanatus and X.\nvesiculosus, as well as photographs of X. raduloides basidiomata, are\nprovided. A key to X. lanatus and similar species is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylodon ITS BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117280.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylodon ITS ME","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117279.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylodon 28S ME","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117281.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylodon 28S BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117282.phy"}]}
