However, the molecular genetic bases of such convergent\nevolution remain unresolved. Two multicellular volvocine green algae,\nVolvox and Astrephomene, exhibit convergent evolution of germ-soma\ndifferentiation. The complete genome sequence is now available for\nVolvox, while genome information is scarce for Astrephomene. Here, we\ngenerated the de novo whole genome sequence of Astrephomene\ngubernaculifera and conducted RNA-seq analysis of isolated somatic and\nreproductive cells. In Volvox, tandem duplication and\nneofunctionalization of the ancestral transcription factor gene\n(RLS1/rlsD) might have led to the evolution of regA, the master\nregulator for Volvox germ-soma differentiation. However, our genome data\ndemonstrated that Astrephomene has not undergone tandem duplication of\nthe RLS1/rlsD homolog or acquisition of a regA-like gene. Our RNA-seq\nanalysis revealed the downregulation of photosynthetic and anabolic gene\nexpression in Astrephomene somatic cells, as in Volvox. Among genes with\nhigh expression in somatic cells of Astrephomene, we identified three\ngenes encoding putative transcription factors, which may regulate\nsomatic cell differentiation. Thus, the convergent evolution of\ngerm-soma differentiation in the volvocine algae may have occurred by\nthe acquisition of different regulatory circuits that generate a similar\ndivision of labor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127779.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127781","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127781.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127782","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127782.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127786.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127780","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127780.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127783.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127785.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127788.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127787.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr127784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127784.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr128766","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128766.phy"}]}
