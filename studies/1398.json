Bayesian\nand parsimony hypotheses showed little disagreement. The combined\nanalysis, but not any of the partitioned ones, showed strong support for\nthe monophyly of Corytophanidae and the three contained genera,\nBasiliscus, Corytophanes, and Laemanctus. Basiliscus is the sister taxon\nof a well-supported clade formed by Corytophanes and Laemanctus. The\nrelationships of species within the genera Basiliscus and Corytophanes\nreceived weak support, regardless of the method used. We defend those\nrelationships as feasible and open to further testing. Data derived from\nthe ultrastructure of spermatozoa are potentially a good source of\ncharacters for systematic inferences of Iguania and its major lineages.\nThe BPA results suggest a Central American origin of Corytophanidae and\nthat some events allied to Central America formation were responsible\nfor differentiation of the groups of Corytophanidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4C","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Iguania Constrained Sptz","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_562.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4D final","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_648.phy"},{"tree_label":"Iguania Constrained combined","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_649.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B Areas","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanid area relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Iguania Constrained Morphology","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2231.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2227.phy"},{"tree_label":"Iguania Constrained mtDNA","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2228.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B morphoconsensus","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corytophanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2230.phy"}]}
