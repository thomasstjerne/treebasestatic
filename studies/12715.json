Morphological and molecular data\nsuggest that A. barthelatii belongs to the ‘warty-gland’ subclade of\nClade V defined by Hearn elsewhere. Since the warty-gland clade is\nrestricted to the Malagasy region we suggest a Malagasy origin of this\nMaorian species of Adenia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52844.phy"}]}
