The morphological characteristics of the fungi corresponded to\nthe description of Epichloë sylvatica. A phylogenetic analysis revealed\nthat isolates derived from surface-sterilized tillers or single\nascospores from stroma on its hosts were included in the same clade with\nthose identified with E. sylvatica. In Japan, to date, Epichloë fungi\ncausing choke disease on B. sylvaticum were listed only as Epichloë\ntyphina. We confirmed that both stroma-forming and symptomless\nendophytes inhabiting B. sylvaticum in Japan are E. sylvatica, not E.\ntyphina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"test","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe beta-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100509.phy"}]}
