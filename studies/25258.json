In this study a simple molecular strategy, the\nCOIBar-RFLP, is proposed to unveil commercial fraud based on the\npractice of species substitution in the swordfish trade. In particular,\nCOI barcoding allowed the identification of the species Prionace glauca,\nMustelus mustelus and Oxynotus centrina in slices labeled as Xiphias\ngladius. Furthermore, the enzymatic digestion of COI amplicons using the\nMboI restriction endonuclease allowed simoultaneus discrimination of the\nfour species. Interestingly, an intraspecific differential MboI pattern\nwas obtained for the swordfish samples. This pattern was useful to\ndifferentiate the two different clades revealed in this species by\nphylogenetic analyses using several molecular markers. These results\nindicate the need to strengthen regulations and molecular tools for\ncombating the occurrence of fraud along the seafood supply chain and\nshow that COIBar-RFLP could become a standardized molecular tool to\nassess seafood authenticity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120259.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120258","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120258.phy"}]}
