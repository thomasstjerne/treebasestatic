The new dinosaur is the largest\ndromaeosaurid yet discovered in the Southern Hemisphere and depicts\nbizarre cranial and postcranial features. Its long and low snout bears\nnumerous, small-sized conical teeth, a condition resembling spinosaurid\ntheropods. Its short forearms depart from the characteristically\nlong-armed condition of all dromaeosaurids and their close avian\nrelatives. The new discovery amplifies the range of morphological\ndisparity among unenlagiines, demonstrating that by the end of the\nCretaceous this clade included large, short-armed forms alongside\ncrow-sized, long-armed, possibly flying representatives. The new\ndinosaur is the youngest record of dromaeosaurids from Gondwana and\nrepresents a previously unrecognized lineage of large predators in Late\nCretaceous dinosaur faunas mainly dominated by abelisaurid\ntheropods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55929.phy"}]}
