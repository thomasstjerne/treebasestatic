This fungus was isolated\nfrom dead branches of Citrus spp., Conocarpus erectus, Cupressus sp.,\nEucalyptus sp., Juglans regia and Ziziphus sp. in southwestern Iran.\nMulti-locus DNA sequence based phylogeny, in combination with\nmorphology, were used to characterize eight isolates of this species.\nTwo phylogenetic trees were constructed on the basis of the combined\nsequences of internal transcribed spacer regions 1 & 2 and 5.8S\nnrDNA (ITS), partial large subunit 28S nrDNA (LSU-D1/D2), partial\nÎ²-tubulin (tub2) and partial RNA polymerase II (rpb2). The morphological\ndifferences between the new and other previously known species of\nNeodidymelliopsis are strongly supported by the multi-locus phylogenetic\nanalysis. In both three- and four- locus phylogenetic trees, the\nisolates of new species formed a strongly supported clade, which is\ndistinct from other formerly described species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodidymelliopsis farokhinejadii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135425.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodidymelliopsis farokhinejadii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135426.phy"}]}
