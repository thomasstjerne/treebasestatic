In general,\nparthenogenetic organisms are often found in harsh environments, such as\nat high latitudes and altitudes, in xeric as opposed to mesic\nconditions, in isolated habitats such as islands and island-like areas,\nand at the peripheral regions of the taxonâs range. In E. shigae,\nhowever, the distributions of bisexual and unisexual populations overlap\nbroadly in their respective geographic ranges. In the analysis of\nmitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI, we revealed that unisexual populations\nwere of monophyletic origin and recently differentiated somewhere in\nwestern Japan. In the nuclear DNA EFI-Î± analysis, parthenogenetic\nstrains had two genotypes, i.e. the heterozygous genotype of E1/E3 and\nthe homozygous genotype of E1/E1 or E3/E3, while specimens of bisexual\nlineage had 20 genotypes. These results are consistent with automixis\nmode of reproduction for the parthenogenetic strains, and also support\nthe monophyletic origin of the parthenogenetic strains. Furthermore,\nthere would be no gene flow between the specimens of the bisexual\nlineage and those of the parthenogenetic strain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ephoron shigae 16S Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89095.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ephoron shigae 16S COI Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89096.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ephoron shigae COI Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89094.phy"}]}
