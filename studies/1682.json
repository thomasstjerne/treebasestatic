These ancient,\nnutrient-poor areas have been suggested to be possible ancestral regions\nfor neotropical plant diversity. Members of the genus Potalia of the\nGentianaceae grow in the New World tropics from Costa Rica in the north\nto southern Bolivia. Until recently, only one Potalia species was\naccepted, but a new revision identifies eight others. Three species are\nendemic to lowland, white sand areas in the Amazon and Orinoco basins\nand share morphological characteristics with Anthocleista, the\nAfrican-Malagasy sister group to Potalia. To resolve phylogenetic and\nbiogeographic patterns in Potalia, morphological characters and\nsequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 5S\nnon-transcribed spacer (5S-NTS) of the ribosomal nuclear DNA were\ncollected and used for phylogenetic reconstruction using Bayesian and\nparsimony-based methods. Potalia species restricted to ancient,\nnutrient-poor white sand areas of the Amazon Basin and Guayana Shield\nwere placed basal to other Potalia taxa from finer, lateritic, and\nyounger soils, further suggesting that lowland white sand areas may be\nancestral seats of neotropical diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns in Potalia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined Bayes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns in Potalia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4692.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 2A and 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns in Potalia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns in Potalia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeographic and phylogenetic patterns in Potalia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4695.phy"}]}
