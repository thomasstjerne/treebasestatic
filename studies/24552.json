Here, based on\nmorphological and molecular evidence, we describe a new species of\nFulvifomes growing on Pseudocedrela kotschyi in Benin. The new species\nnamed Fulvifomes yoroui is characterized by perennial, pileate, ungulate\nbasidiocarps and subglobose to globose basidiospores 5.36.5 × 4.55.8 µm.\nAnalyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear large subunit\nrDNA (nLSU) datasets with maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic\ninference methods show that F. yoroui represents a distinct lineage\nwithin Fulvifomes clade. It is the first time that the new species of\nFulvifomes is described based on material from tropical Africa. This\nfinding stimulates further investigations of Fulvifomes in tropical\nAfrica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree inferred from Bayesian (BY) and\nMaximum Likelihood (ML) analyses of LSU dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_118655.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis (BY) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nanalyses of the combined ITS-LSU dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_118657.phy"}]}
