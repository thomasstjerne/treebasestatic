The\nstrain, Y.lipolytica NCIM 3590 (Yl3590), isolated from Scottish sea\nwaters was reinvestigated for its phenotypic, molecular and genomic\nproperties as it exhibited characteristics unlike Y.lipolytica, namely,\ngrowth at low temperatures (10-20°C) and absence of extracellular\nlipolytic activity. Preliminary studies based on colony/cellular\nmorphology, effect of temperature/salt on growth, sugar assimilation and\nfermentation tests were inconclusive to ascertain the identity of the\nstrain. Hence, molecular identification was performed using ITS and\nD1/D2 sequences and BLAST analysis suggeststhatYl3590is 100% identical\nto Y.bubula NCAIM Y.01998 and Y.bubula CBS 12934. Phylogenetic analysis\nwith reference Yarrowia sequences reported in the NCBI database revealed\nthatYl3590 clustered with Y.bubula under a separate node. Additionally,\nto corroborate the results, whole genome sequencing using IIlumina\nNextSeq technology was performed and we report here the first draft\ngenome of this strain. The genomic relatedness of Yl3590 was determined\nwith the available reference genome sequences of Y.bubula CBS 12934 as\nwell as Y.lipolytica CLIB 89 andCLIB122 using genome wide metrics,\ndigital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity\n(ANI). The values obtained for dDDH (94.1%), ANIb/ANIm (99.41/99.42%)and\nfor Ortho ANI (99.47%) between Yl3590 and Y.bubula were greater than for\nY. lipolytica. These were above the acceptable threshold values (dDDH ≥\n70%, ANI/orthoANI ≥ 95-96 %) for species delineation, indicating that\nthey belong to the same genomic species. Hence, we suggest that Yl3590\ncould be reclassified as Yarrowia bubula NCIM 3590.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr116722","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116722.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr116721","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116721.phy"}]}
