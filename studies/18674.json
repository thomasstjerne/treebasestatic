Recently, three of these pathogens were formally described as L.\ngiganteum forma caninum, L. deciduum, and Paralagenidium karlingii\nwithout phylogenetic verification. In light of the complex nature of\nLagenidium taxonomy and the recent reports of mammalian pathogenic\nspecies of Lagenidium by Vilela et al. (2015), the status of these taxa\nneeded to be verified with due consideration of the available data for\nLagenidium and its allied genera (Dick 1997, 2001). This study does so\nthrough morphologic characterisation of the mammalian pathogenic\nspecies, and phylogenetic analyses of SSU, ITS, LSU, TUBB, COX1 and\nCOX2sequences representing a wide range of oomycetes, including at least\nfive genera with species once considered to be Lagenidium. The six-gene\nphylogeny generally supports the classification of Lagenidium by Dick\n(1997, 2001) with a well-supported Lagenidium clade that includes the\nmammalian pathogens L. giganteum f. caninum and L. deciduum, and\nwell-supported clades for Myzocytiopsis and Salilagenidium. The genus\nParalagenidium is phylogenetically unrelated to any of the main clades\nwithin the class Peronosporomycetes. This genus contains two species:\nPl. karlingii, and an undescribed species referred to as Pl. sp.\nAG-2015a. Phylogenetic data supports the inclusion of some novel\nmammalian pathogenic species reported by Vilela et al. (2015) in L.\ndeciduum, Pl. karlingii, and Pl. sp. AG-2015a. Close relationships\nbetween pathogens of mammals and those of insects/nematodes were\nrevealed. Further characterisation of lagenidiaceous taxa is needed to\nestablish the risk of mammalian infection by pathogens of insects and\nnematodes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig S2 28S ML Tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 - Paralagenidium 28S ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93459.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93456","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93456.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig1 S1 ML","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93457","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93457.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 TUBB ML Tree","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 Paralagenidium TUBB ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93463.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 18S ML Tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 Paralagenidium 18S ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93458.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 cox1 ML Tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 Paralagenidium cox1 ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93460.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 ITS ML Tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 Paralagenidium ITS ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93462.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 cox2 ML Tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig S2 Paralagenidium cox2 ML Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93461.phy"}]}
