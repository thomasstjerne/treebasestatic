The\nclosest species based on a megablast search of the full ITS sequence is\nAmanita inopinata, currently Saproamanita inopinata (D.A. Reid &\nBas) Redhead, Vizzini, Drehmel & Contu (2016), from the Netherlands\n(accession number KM026507) and from New Zealand (accession number\nHQ533044) both with 100% coverage and a 97 % Identity score from 18 base\ndifferences and 9 gaps. Only one other species, A. pruittii, currently\nSaproamanita pruittii (A. H. Sm. ex Tulloss, J. Lindgr. & C. Arora)\nRedhead, Vizzini, Drehmel & Contu (2016), had 100% coverage for the\nfull ITS sequence in the megablast search, with a 96% Identity score\nfrom 24 base differences and 10 gaps. Following the above-mentioned\nspecies, the highest megablast search was to an Amanita sp. (accession\nnumber KY081706) from Brazil with 99% coverage and an 88% Identity score\nfrom 75 base differences and 22 gaps. The percent coverage of the full\nITS in the megablast search dropped significantly thereafter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saproamanita quitensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110209.phy"}]}
