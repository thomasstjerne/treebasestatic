E. Freire, a new\nmonotypic genus, is here described and illustrated to accomodate one\nspecies that was initially placed in Helichrysum, H. gnaphalioides, as\nChryselium gnaphalioides. The new genus Chryselium, is a monoecious herb\nwith single stems and terminal capitulescences that are densely\nglomerulate from the Tropical Andes of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,\nBolivia, and Peru. This genus differs fundamentally from Helichrysum by\nhaving a stoloniferous habit and corollas with purple apices. A\nmolecular analysis using DNA sequences from nuclear (ITS and ETS)\nmarkers placed this genus in a clade with Chevreulia, Cuatrecasasiella,\nAntennaria, and Diaperia in the FLAG group. Affinities of the new genus\nwith other genera are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114184.phy"}]}
