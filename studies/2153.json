These extreme habitats are\nthought to drive the extensive evolutionary convergence, and thus\nmorphological homoplasy, that has long thwarted a natural classification\nof cheilanthoid ferns. Here we present the first multigene phylogeny to\nfocus on taxa traditionally assigned to the large genus Notholaena. New\nWorld taxa (Notholaena sensu Tryon) are only distantly related to\nspecies occurring in the Old World (Notholaena sensu Pichi-Sermolli).\nThe circumscription of Notholaena adopted in recent American floras is\nshown to be paraphyletic, with species usually assigned to Cheilanthes\nand Cheiloplecton nested within it. The position of Cheiloplecton is\nparticularly surprising\u001agiven its well-developed false indusium and\nnon-farinose blade, it is morphologically anomalous within the\n\u001anotholaenoids.\u001a In addition to clarifying natural relationships, the\nphylogenetic hypothesis presented here helps to resolve outstanding\nnomenclatural issues and provides a basis for examining character\nevolution within this diverse, desert-adapted clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monophyly of Notholaena, Pteridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5001.phy"}]}
