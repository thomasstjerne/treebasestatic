Combined with the morphological characters a new genus,\nPseudofibroporia gen. nov., is established. Three new species,\nFibroporia bambusae sp. nov. , Fibroporia ceracea sp. nov. and\nPseudofibroporia citrina sp. nov. are descibed from China. Illustrated\ndescriptions of the novel species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr93594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93594.phy"}]}
