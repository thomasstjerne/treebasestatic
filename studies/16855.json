Similar\nsymptoms have also been observed on trees of this species in various\nparts of South Africa. The most common fungi isolated from disease\nsymptoms on S. parahyba var. amazonicum in both locations were species\nof the Botryosphaeriaceae. The aim of this study was to identify these\nfungi from both Ecuador and South Africa, and to test their\npathogenicity in greenhouse and field trials. Isolates obtained were\ngrouped based on culture morphology and identified using comparisons of\nDNA sequence data for the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and\nTranslation Elongation Factor 1α (EF-1α) gene regions. The β-tubulin-2\n(BT2) locus was also sequenced for some isolates where identification\nwas difficult. Three greenhouse trials were conducted in South Africa\nalong with a field trial in Ecuador. Neofusicoccum parvum was obtained\nfrom trees in both areas and was the dominant taxon in South Africa.\nLasiodiplodia theobromae was the dominant taxon in Ecuador, probably due\nto the subtropical climate in the area. Isolates of N. vitifusiforme\n(from South Africa only), N. umdonicola, and L. pseudotheobromae (from\nEcuador only) were also obtained. All isolates used in the pathogenicity\ntrials produced lesions on inoculated plants, suggesting that the\nBotryosphaeriaceae contribute to the die-back of S. parahyba trees.\nWhile the disease is clearly not caused by a single species of the\nBotryosphaeriaceae in either region, N. parvum has been introduced into\nat least one of the regions. This species has a broad host range and\ncould have been introduced on other hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium ITS EF BT Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80452.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus of 23","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium ITS Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80328.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 44","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium EF Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80360.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium ITS Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80359.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium EF Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80451.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium ITS EF Lasidodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80483.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 29","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schizolobium BT Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80391.phy"}]}
