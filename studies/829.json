The\nresults generally agree with morphological species concepts. There was\nstrong support for monophyly of the genus Stemphylium. Analysis of the\ngpd fragment in particular was useful for establishing well-supported\nrelationships among the species and isolates of Stemphylium. Species of\nStemphylium that appear to have lost the ability to produce a sexual\nstate are scattered among the species with the ability to reproduce\nsexually (Pleospora spp.). Species that are pathogenic to alfalfa are\nresolved into two groups. Stemphylium botryosum and two isolates with\nmorphological characters similar to S. globuliferum had identical\nsequences at both loci. These two loci in S. vesicarium, S. alfalfae and\nS. herbarum are nearly identical but differ from S. botryosum. The\nseparation of S. vesicarium, S. herbarum and S. alfalfae into separate\nspecies by morphometric evidence was not supported by the molecular\ndata. Morphological and developmental characters such a size and shape\nof conidia, conidiophores, and ascospores, and size and time of\nmaturation of pseudothecia are useful for diagnosing species. However,\nother morphological characters such as septum development and small\nvariations in conidial wall ornamentation are not as useful.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stemphylium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3967.phy"}]}
