Xylodon\nbambusinus is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate\nbasidiomata with smooth to tuberculate hymenial surface, a monomitic\nhyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamp connections and\npresence of capitate and fusiform cystidia, allantoid, colorless,\nthin-walled, smooth, inamyloid and indextrinoid, acyanophilous\nbasidiospores. Xylodon xinpingensis is characterized by resupinate\nbasidiomata with cream hymenial surface, a monomitic hyphal system with\ngenerative hyphae bearing clamp connections, ellipsoid, colorless,\nsmooth, thin-walled basidiospores (4.56 × 3.55 µm). Sequences of ITS and\nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated, and\nphylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The phylogenetic analyses\nbased on molecular data of ITS sequences showed that X. bambusinus was\nsister to X. subclavatus, and the taxon X. xinpingensis grouped with X.\nastrocystidiatus and X. paradoxus. The nLSU dataset revealed that X.\nbambusinus grouped with X. asperus and X. brevisetus, and X.\nxinpingensis grouped with X. rimosissimus. Both morphological and\nmolecular evidences confirmed the placement of two new species in\nXylodon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125900.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125906.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125904.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125907.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125908.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125903.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125902","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125902.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125905","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125905.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125901.phy"}]}
