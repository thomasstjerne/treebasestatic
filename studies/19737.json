These species are morphologically distinct\nfrom all other known species. Pythium ershadii is morphologically\ncharacterized by pyriform ornamented oogonia and rarely production of\npyriform oospores. Pythium pyrioosporum differs from other species of\nthe genus by the production of pyriform oospores and smooth walled\noogonia, oospores with a tapering elongation toward a hypogynous\nantheridium and intercalary hypogynous antheridia. Pythium urmianum is\ndistinguished by the presence of intercalary hypogynous antheridia,\nsmooth walled oogonia formed laterally on hyphae or on short side\nbranches and peanut-shaped oospores. Phylogenetic relationships of these\nnew taxa with other Pythium species were investigated using internal\ntranscribed spacers rDNA and partial coxI sequence data. The three\nspecies reside in clade E1 and are separated from closely related\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97977","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97977.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97976","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97976.phy"}]}
