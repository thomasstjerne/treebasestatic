Morphologically,\nthis new species is similar in outward appearance to members of subgenus\nMallocybe (the Mallocybe clade). Phylogenetically, however, I.\nmisakaensis is positioned with strong bootstrap support between sections\nRimosae sensu stricto and Cervicolores based on RPB2 nucleotide sequence\ndata. A taxonomic description, illustrations, phylogenetic position, and\nevolutionary consequences of I. misakaensis are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5852.phy"}]}
