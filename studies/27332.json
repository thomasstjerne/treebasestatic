These include six new\nspecies and four new records for Taiwan, namely C. caribense, C.\nelegans, C. jinghongense, C. kenyense, C. macrosporum sp. nov., C.\nnanhuaense sp. nov., C. parvum sp. nov., C. paulopallidum sp. nov., C.\ntaiwanense sp. nov., and C. waffleum sp. nov. Based on a re-examination\nof the type specimens, the placement of C. nigrum in Canalisporium was\nverified, but C. microsporum was found to be previously misidentified.\nThe latter is transferred to Trimmatostroma as a new combination. Other\nCanalisporium species not collected in Taiwan are briefly discussed. The\nphylogenetic relationship of Canalisporium species was sought among\nrepresentative taxa from related fungal familiar lineages, namely the\nConioscyphaceae, Fuscosporellaceae, Pleurotheciaceae and Savoryellaceae,\nby comparing the sequences of their nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS\nbarcode). Identification of Canalisporium species accepted in this paper\nis based on phylogenetic relationship and morphological comparison, plus\nsome statistical analyses. Canalisporium grenadoideum is synonymized\nwith C. elegans. A key to the 20 accepted species of Canalisporium is\ngiven.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Canalisporium TREE","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127684.phy"}]}
