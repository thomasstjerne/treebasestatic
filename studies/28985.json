The species is characterized by its clitocyboid\nto omphalioid habit, carneous, greyish yellow to brownish pileus, brown\nto dark reddish brown, longitudinally fibrillose-striate stipe,\nnon-amyloid, non-smooth spores, the absence of cystidia and the presence\nof clamp connections. A comprehensive description of the species is\nprovided along with photo-illustration and comparisons with phenetically\nsimilar and phylogenetically related species. The nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the nuclear large subunit\nrDNA (nrLSU) region of the new species was sequenced and analyzed. The\nphylogenetic analysis supported the novelty of the species and its\nplacement within the genus. Furthermore, a discussion on the proposal to\nestablish a new section is made, and a key is provided for the\nInfundibulicybe species as reported from China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134454.phy"},{"tree_label":"consistent with the figure in paper","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134453","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134453.phy"}]}
