In order to clarify the phylogenetic\nposition of additional species of cleistothecial ascomycetes,\nparticularly those placed in the Cephalothecaceae and Pseudeurotiaceae\nof the Eurotiales, partial sequences of the small and large subunit\nribosomal DNAs of fourteen taxa were compared with those of other\nascomycetes. Phylogenetic trees from both sequence sets showed that some\nspecies in Pseudeurotiaceae are closely related to the taxa of four\ndifferent orders of the perithecial ascomycetes (Hypocreales,\nSordariales, Ophiostomatales, and Xylariales). Others (species of\nPleuroascus, Connersia, Leuconeurospora, and Pseudeurotium) were not\nclosely related to perithecial ascomycetes or Eurotiales, but to\ndiscomycetes and loculoascomycetes. Cephalotheca sulfurea, the type of\nthe Cephalothecaceae, formed a monophyletic group with pseudeurotiaceous\nspecies of Cryptendoxyla and Albertiniella. The phylogeny provided in\nthis study suggests strongly that all of these fungi are excluded from\nthe Eurotiales where they have been placed and that they do not form a\nnatural group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3447.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3448.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3449.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3450.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cleistothecial Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3452.phy"}]}
