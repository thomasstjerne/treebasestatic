Described species so far have been found mainly in association\nwith bark beetles in the Northern Hemisphere. The aims of this study\nwere therefore to survey of distribution of species of Ceratocystiopsis\nassociated with bark beetles infesting Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris\nin Norway. Adults for 22 different bark beetle species were collected\nfrom 13 stands in Norway. During this study, we recovered 126 isolates\nshowing affinities to Ceratocystiopsis representing six species,\nincluding two described and four undescribed taxa. The four undescribed\ntaxa collected during this work were characterised based on their\nmorphological characteristics and multi-gene phylogenies. Herein, we\ndescribe these new species as Ceratocystiopsis chalcographii sp. nov.,\nCeratocystiopsis debeeria sp. nov., Ceratocystiopsis norroenii sp. nov.\nand Ceratocystiopsis troendelagii sp. nov. Ceratocystiopsis norroenii\nand C. rollhanseniana were the most frequently isolated species although\nthe latter species had a much wider vector range. This study expands our\nknowledge about the taxonomy and species diversity of Ceratocystiopsis\nand beetle-fungus relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134309","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_134309.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134310","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_134310.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134311","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_134311.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-LSU-BT tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134315","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134315.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134312","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134312.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAL tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134314","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134314.phy"}]}
