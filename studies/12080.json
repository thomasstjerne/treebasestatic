We reexamine the phylogenetic\nrelationships of these taxa by using multiple individuals per species.\nIn addition, we estimate population genetic structure in two\nwell-sampled taxa occurring on Madagascar and the Comoro Islands (P.\nrufus and P. seychellensis comorensis). Despite finding a similar\npattern of low sequence divergence among species, increased sampling\nprovides insight into the phylogeographic history of western Indian\nOcean Pteropus, uncovering high levels of gene flow within species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49465.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49463.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49466.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49464.phy"}]}
