It\nis morphologically unique in producing two forms of unilocular,\nendoconidial conidiomata, i.e., a superficially Phoma-like spherical,\noften ostiolate form and a cylindrical, non-ostiolate, often setose\ncleistopycnidial form. Locules of both forms are pseudoparenchymatous,\nfilled with hyaline, thin-walled, endoconidial conidiogenous cells.\nEndoconidia are hyaline and unicellular. One- or two-celled\nchlamydospores are abundant in culture. Phylogenetic analysis of the\nLSU, ITS, and Î²-tubulin regions indicates Endophoma is a member of the\nDidymellaceae and remote from all other endoconidial genera.\nEndoconidiogenesis has not been previously reported within the\nDidymellaceae, and Endophoma represents the first report of a\ncoelomycetous, endoconidial genus in the Pleosporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Phoma 8","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endophoma from bat-cave soil","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31264.phy"}]}
