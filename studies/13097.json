Here we report a new\nArchaeopteryx-like theropod from China. This find further demonstrates\nthat many features formerly regarded as being diagnostic of Avialae,\nincluding long and robust forelimbs, actually characterize the more\ninclusive group Paraves (composed of the avialans and the\ndeinonychosaurs). Notably, adding the new taxon into a comprehensive\nphylogenetic analysis shifts Archaeopteryx to the Deinonychosauria.\nDespite only tentative statistical support, this result challenges the\ncentrality of Archaeopteryx in the transition to birds. If this new\nphylogenetic hypothesis can be confirmed by further investigation,\ncurrent assumptions regarding the avialan ancestral condition will need\nto be reevaluated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coelurosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55509.phy"}]}
