During a survey of the freshwater\ndiatom flora of Petuniabukta (Spitsbergen), several morphodemes\nbelonging to the Achnanthidium minutissimum species complex were\nrecorded. Molecular phylogenies based on rbcL, 28S and 18S sequences,\nincluding single cells from Canada and strains from Marion Island\n(sub-Antarctica) and GenBank revealed the presence of twelve distinct A.\nminutissimum complex lineages, of which three contained strains from\nPetuniabukta. One Arctic lineage is described as a new species.\nAchnanthidium digitatum sp. nov. is morphologically characterized by\nnarrow, linear to only slightly lanceolate valves and usually two\nareolae per stria. The two remaining Arctic lineages are in need of a\nmore complete morphological and molecular comparison with other\nrepresentatives of the A. minutissimum complex to clarify their\ntaxonomic identity. It is argued that implementation of molecular data\nin the taxonomy of Achnanthidium will be essential to solve the\ntaxonomic problems associated with this group, eventually resulting in a\nbetter understanding of the biogeography and niche differentiation of\ndifferent species belonging to the A. minutissimum complex. Ideally,\nthis should be based on more variable genes than the currently widely\n18S, which does not seem to have a species level resolution in the A.\nminutissimum complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achnanthidium LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101864.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achnanthidium 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101866.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achnanthidium rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101865.phy"}]}
