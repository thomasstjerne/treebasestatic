The\nambrosia beetle Cyrtogenius africus is often found infesting diseased\nand dying trees. The aim of this study was to identify the\nophiostomatoid fungi occurring in the galleries of C. africus. Logs\ninfested with this beetle were collected from the KwaZulu-Natal,\nLimpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West Provinces of South Africa. Fungi\nbelonging to the Ophiostomatales were identified based on morphology and\ncomparison of sequence data for the Î²-tubulin, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and LSU\ngene regions. A novel species of Ophiostoma and a novel genus in the\nOphiostomatales were identified. Inoculation studies with these fungi\nproduced lesions in the branches of healthy E. ingens trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88421","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88421.phy"}]}
