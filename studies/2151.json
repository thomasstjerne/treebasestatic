{"Authors":" Paola Pedraza-Peñalosa","Year":" 2008","Title":" Systematics of the Neotropical Blueberry Genus Disterigma\n(Ericaceae)","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Disterigma s.l. comprises 37 species of small shrubs found\nin Central and South America, mostly in cloud forests and páramos. The\nnotion that the morphological circumscription of Disterigma s.l. is too\nwide and that it may not be a natural group was supported by recent\nmolecular evidence extracted from only a few species of Disterigma. This\nstudy addresses the monophyly and position of Disterigma s.l. within the\ncomplex blueberry tribe Vaccinieae through an intensive taxon sampling.\nSeventy-nine species are sampled, including 84% of the species of\nDisterigma s.l. and 13 genera of neotropical Vaccinieae. The parsimony\nanalysis of nrITS and ndhF data reveal that Disterigma s.l. is\npolyphyletic with three independent origins within Vaccinieae. The\nmajority of the species form a well supported monophyletic group,\nDisterigma s.s., which is located within a large Andean clade; all the\nDisterigma s.s. species share the presence of a differentiated pair of\napical bracteoles. Segregated from Disterigma s.s., but also Andean in\norigin, is the novel Central Andes Segregated Disterigma clade, where D.\nbracteatum, D. pentandrum, D. rimbachii, and D. ulei are found. Also\nresolved outside of Disterigma s.s. is D. trimerum, a taxon of\nMesoamerican origin.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 1 and 2","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Disterigma, str cons nrITS and cp ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3105.phy"}]}
