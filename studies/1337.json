The ITS1 - 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS2 for 30 species have been\nsequenced, which represent about 25% of the recognized species in the\ngenus. The molecular data confirm the monophyly of Didymodon as clearly\nseparated from Barbula. The transfer of Didymodon giganteus to Geheebia,\nof D. sinuosus to Oxystegus, and to Trichostomopsis is not supported by\nthe molecular data. The phylogenetic affinities of the species generally\ndo not correspond with the infrageneric classification proposed for the\ngenus based on morphological characteristics. The only monophyletic\nsection is Asteriscium, but only after the inclusion of D.\nbistratosus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymodon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2118.phy"}]}
