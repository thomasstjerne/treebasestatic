New genus Liberomyces with\ntwo species, L. saliciphilus and L. macrosporus, is described. Both\nspecies have subglobose conidiomata containing holoblastic sympodial\nconidiogenous cells. The conidiomata dehisced irregularly or by ostiole\nand oozed a slimy suspension of conidia. The conidia were hyaline,\nnarrowly allantoid with a typically curved distal end. In L.\nmacrosporus, simultaneous production of filamentous β-conidia was\noccassionally observed. The genus has no known teleomorph. Related\nsequences in the public databases belong to endophytes of angiosperms.\nPhylogenetic analysis revealed a position close to the Xylariales\n(Sordariomycetes), but family and order affiliation remained\nunclear.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sup.
