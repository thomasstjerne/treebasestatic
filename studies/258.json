A derived calamistrum, which forms an oval to rectangular\npatch, is considered a synapomorphy uniting the Lycosoidea and several\nother genera formerly placed in the Tengellidae and Miturgidae. In the\nresulting analysis the Lycosoidea are shown to be monophyletic and the\nTengellidae and Miturgidae polyphyletic. The Senoculidae, Oxyopidae,\nStiphidiidae, and Psechridae form a monophyletic group. The monophyly of\nthe Lycosidae, Trechaleidae (including Rhoicininae), Pisauridae plus\nDolomedidae, and Zoropsidae are confirmed, whereas monophyly of the\nCtenidae, Machadoniinae, and Uliodoninae are called into question.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 84-87","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycosoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1319.phy"}]}
