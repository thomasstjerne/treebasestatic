Here we present an\nexpansive molecular phylogeny of Costus Nakai (Costaceae) with a focus\non the Neotropical species within the clade, sampling 47 of the known 51\nNeotropical species and including five molecular markers for\nphylogenetic analysis (ITS, ETS, rps16, trnL-F, and CaM). We use the\nphylogenetic results to investigate shifts in pollination syndrome, with\nthe intention of addressing potential mechanisms leading to the rapid\nradiation documented for this clade. Our ancestral reconstruction of\npollination syndrome presents the first evidence in this genus of an\nevolutionary toggle in pollination morphologies, demonstrating both the\nmultiple independent evolutions of ornithophily (bird pollination) as\nwell as reversals to melittophily (bee pollination). We show that the\nornithophilous morphology has evolved at least eight times independently\nwith four potential reversals to melittophilous morphology, and confirm\nprior work showing that neither pollination syndrome defines a\nmonophyletic lineage. Based on the current distribution for the\nNeotropical and African species, we reconstruct the ancestral\ndistribution of the Neotropical clade to the Pacific Coast of Mexico and\nCentral America. Our results indicate an historic dispersal of a\nbee-pollinated taxon from Africa to the Pacific Coast of Mexico/Central\nAmerica, with subsequent diversification leading to the evolution of a\nbird-pollinated floral morphology in multiple derived lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree of Costus ITS","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of Costus ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77001.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT Costus rps16","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of Costus rps16","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus Maximum Likelihood tree -23899.35952LL","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus ML bootstrap tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus ML bootstrap tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MrBayes tree no clade cut off","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MrBayes tree no clade cut off","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76996.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree of Costus ETS","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of Costus ETS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76997.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree of Costus CaM","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of Costus CaM","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76998.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MB CaM con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MB CaM","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MB ETS con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MB ETS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77389.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP Majority rule tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PAUP 50% majority rule consensus tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76994.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP Strict consensus tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PAUP Strict consensus tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MB ITS con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MB ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MB rps16 con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MB rps16","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Costus MB trnLF con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Costus MB trnLF","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77392.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree of Costus trnLF","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of Costus trnLF","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76991.phy"}]}
