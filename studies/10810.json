Species\nfound at temperate latitudes are restricted to the eastern half of the\ncountry; of these, three (N. crenata, N. geminata, N. indica) also occur\nin the tropics, while two (N. montana and N. spinulosperma) are only\ntemperate. As part of a broader phylogenetic study of the genus, which\nemployed both nuclear (nrITS) and chloroplast (rbcL, trnK 5â€™ intron) DNA\nsequence data, we found N. montana to generate a major source of\nincongruence between phylogenetic trees of Nymphoides derived from\nnuclear and chloroplast data matrices. Our phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that N. montana resolved variously with N. geminata (nuclear\ndata) and N. spinulosperma (chloroplast data), which despite their\nstrong morphological similarity, are not themselves closely related.\nThese results indicate a hybrid origin for N. montana, which\nsubsequently retains evidence of its maternal lineage in the chloroplast\ngenome, while nuclear DNA markers (nrITS data) have been converted to\nresemble the paternal lineage exclusively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nymphoides","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_21343.phy"}]}
