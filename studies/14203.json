One specimen of Irenopsis\nheveae from the state of EspÃ­rito Santo and two from the state of ParÃ¡\nwere analyzed and showed some morphological differences. Some structures\nare similar to morphological characteristics as described and\nillustrated by Vincens in 1915 for Meliola heveae. Morphological\ncomparisons with the type specimen of I.heveae and the alignment of the\nnucleotide sequences of the 28S rDNA region, however, indicate that the\nthree samples belong to the same species. According to these data\nM.heveae and I. heveae are heterotypic synonyms with M. heveae being the\nolder name. As the name I. heveae is already occupied by\nHansford,Irenopsis vincensiiis proposed as new name for the black mildew\non H. brasiliensis. This is the first contribution of molecular sequence\ndata for this species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Black mildews (Meliolales) on Hevea brasiliensis 28S\nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63463.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Black mildews (Meliolales) on Hevea brasiliensis 28S\nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63462.phy"}]}
