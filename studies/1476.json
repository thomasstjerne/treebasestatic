We here infer\nmajor species groups in the genus based on combined sequences from the\nchloroplast atpB-rbcL spacer, the trnL region, and nuclear ribosomal DNA\nITS region for 42 taxa of Hoya and close relatives. To assess levels of\nITS polymorphism, ITS sequences for a third of the accessions were\nobtained by cloning. Most ITS clones grouped by species, indicating that\nspeciation in Hoya usually predates ITS duplication. One ITS sequence of\nH. carnosa, however, grouped with a sequence of the morphologically\nsimilar H. pubicalyx, pointing to recent hybridization or the\npersistence of paralogous copies through a speciation event. The\ntopology resulting from the combined chloroplast and nuclear data\nrecovers some of the morphology-based sections, such as Acanthostemma\nand Eriostemma, as well as a well-supported Australian/New Guinean\nclade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2387.phy"}]}
