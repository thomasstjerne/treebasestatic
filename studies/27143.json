This study focused\non 355 F. oxysporum isolates from soils with low anthropogenic activity\nobtained from the grassland biome of South Africa. Analysis of the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef-1a) gene revealed high levels\nof sequence type (ST) diversity within the soil population in comparison\nto the global dataset. Phylogenetic relationships of the South African\nisolates revealed that only four nested within FOSC Clade 1. This is the\nfirst report of members of the basal clade recovered from ecosystems\nwith low anthropogenic disturbance from Sub-Saharan Africa. The\nremaining strains nested within Clades 2 to 5. This study contributes\nsignificantly to our understanding of the distribution of the FOSC in\nnatural systems as we show that FOSC populations in the South African\ngrassland biome are genetically diverse. This fills in our knowledge gap\nas previous studies reported only on the occurrence and diversity of the\nFOSC isolated from plant debris in South Africa. This is the first\ncomprehensive survey of fusaria from grassland soils with low\nanthropogenic disturbance in South Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126821","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126821.phy"}]}
