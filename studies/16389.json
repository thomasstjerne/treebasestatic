While the symptoms were similar\nin most pine stands, the disease was diagnosed as Canavirgella\nbandfieldii in several locations and Dooks needle blight caused by\nLophophacidium dooksii in others. Due to the similarity in symptom\ndevelopment and morphological features of the causal agents, it was\nsuspected that C. bandfieldii and L. dooksii are either the same species\nor closely related taxa. To test this hypothesis, we examined 20\ncollections representing C. banfieldii and L. dooksii, including the two\ntype specimens. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS sequences confirm the\nsynonymy of C. bandfieldii with the earlier described L. dooksii and\nprovide the first evidence of the close evolutionary relationship of L.\ndooksii to other pine pathogens","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhytimatales ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85870.phy"}]}
