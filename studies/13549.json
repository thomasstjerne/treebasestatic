ITS\nsequences obtained from these collections were introduced into the\npreviously published phylogenetic tree of the genus to assess the\nposition of these species within the Favolaschia clade. A Maximum\nLikelihood analysis generated a phylogenetic tree with a better\nresolution, especially for the clade that contains species belonging to\nthe section Favolaschia subsection Auriscalpium, where the three\nBrazilian specimens also branched. Furthermore, F. cinnabarina was\nconfirmed within the section Auriscalpium clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Favolaschia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58108.phy"}]}
