This fungus is widespread throughout Florida,\nwhere it has been observed on over 60 species of palms. We examined the\ngenetic variability of 25 isolates of G. zonatum obtained in Florida\nfrom 12 different palm species and representing 17 unique property\nlocations in 8 counties to determine if G. zonatum represents a species\ncomplex. The three genomic regions examined were the nuc rDNA\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region (ITS), the coding region for RNA polymerase II\nsubunit 2 (rpb2) domains 6 and 7, and the partial gene for translation\nelongation factor 1α (tef1α). The results indicated that variability\namong these three genomic regions was minimal, and the variability\nobserved was not related to palm host or geographic region within\nFlorida. Thus in the geographic region surveyed, G. zonatum does not\nappear to represent a species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma zonatum RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109982.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma zonatum ITS Figure 1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma zonatum EF-1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109981.phy"}]}
