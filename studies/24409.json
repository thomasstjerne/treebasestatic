These two species are\nclose to R. graveolens in phylogeny. They can be distinguished from R.\ngraveolens for their smaller dimensions of basidia and pleurocystidia.\nRussula pseudograveolens is different from R. paragraveolens because it\nhas shorter basidia, wider pileipellis hyphae, and a subtropical\nhabitat. Morphological discriminations between the two new species and\nthe other common taxa of R. subsect. Xerampelinae were also\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117315","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117315.phy"}]}
