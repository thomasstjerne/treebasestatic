This is the first report of a sexual morph with molecular\nevidence for this genus and the first record of spermatogenesis and\nchlamydospore associated with the asexual state of this family. The\nsexual morph of Aplosporella thailandica resembles Bagnisiella and the\nasexual morph resembles Aplosporella, thus proving the sexual-asexual\nconnection for the first time for this family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ekanayaka","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101538.phy"}]}
