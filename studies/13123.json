The great development of the\nacromion process, directed in a markedly posterior direction, and the\nventral margin of the scapula with a strong ventrodistal expansion,\ninterpreted as autapomorphies of the taxon, justify the validity of the\nspecies. Although the material is rather fragmentary, the racquet-shaped\nscapula, the distal expansion positioned at the same height as the\nproximal expansion, and the well-developed acromion process allow the\ntaxon to be included within Rebbachisauridae. At the same time, the\nangle of less than 90˚ between the coracoid articulation and the\nscapular blade, together with the great development of the acromion\nprocess of the scapula, justify its inclusion in a clade situated as a\nsister group of Cathartesaura. On the basis of the stratigraphic\ncalibration of the phylogenetic analysis, an important diversification\nevent of the rebbachisaurids is deduced during the Hauterivian-\nBarremian. In this context, the presence of two monophyletic groups, one\nof which comprises African-European taxa and the other South American\ntaxa, would place the definitive separation of South America and Africa\nwithin this time interval.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rebbachisauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55548.phy"}]}
