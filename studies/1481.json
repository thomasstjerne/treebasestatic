Fungal laccases are key players in\nlitter-associated polyphenol degradation, but little is known about the\ndiversity and spatial distribution of fungal species with laccase genes\nin soils. Diversity of basidiomycete laccase genes was assessed in a\npodzol and a cambisolic forest soils and the spatial distribution of the\nsequences was mapped in a 100 m2-plot by using PCR on soil DNA extracts.\nDiversity of laccase sequences was higher in the brown forest soil\n(Shannon H, 2.41-2.94) than in the podzol soil (Shannon H, 0.67-1.56),\nand in the organic horizons of both soils. A total of 167 different\nsequences was found in 13 soil cores harvested in the 100 m2-plot.\nDissimilarity in laccase sequence content was 67% between adjacent\ncores. Most sequences were attributed to the extramatrical hyphea of\nknown ectomycorrhizal taxa (e.g., Russulaceae) and restricted to small\npatches (< 0.77 m2) in a specific soil horizon. Soil fungi with\nlaccase genes occupied different niches and showed strikingly variable\ndistribution patterns. The distribution of laccase sequences, and\ncorresponding fungi, likely reflected the oxidative potential in\nsoils.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"331","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycete laccase genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_655.phy"}]}
