This fungus\nresembles species of Diaporthe, but, unlike anamorphic Diaporthe with\ntwo types of conidia, its anamorph produces one conidium type only. It\nis herein described as Ophiodiaporthe cyatheae gen. et sp. nov. Through\npathogenicity tests, O. cyatheae was demonstrated a causal agent of the\nC. lepifera wilt disease. Interestingly, sporulating structures of O.\ncyatheae have not been found on C. lepifera plants but in culture only.\nThe mating system is homothallic. Phylogenetic analyses based on\ncombined sequences of nSSU-rDNA, nLSU-rDNA, EF1-Î±, and RPB2 confirmed\nthat O. cyatheae is closely related to Diaporthe and should be accepted\nin the Diaporthaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MB 50% majority rule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiodiaporthe cyatheae MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57863.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiodiaporthe cyatheae MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57864.phy"}]}
