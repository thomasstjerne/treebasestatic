The sequences\nwere then aligned to the corresponding sequence in the honey bee.\nPhylogenetic analyses based on parsimony and maximum likelihood indicate\nthat the cuckoo bumblebees form a monophyletic group within the true\nbumblebees. The Bombus lucorum group (subgenus Bombus) falls out as the\nsister group to a clade comprising the cuckoo bumblebees and the\nremaining true bumblebees. A strong A+T bias (A+T = 75%) was recorded.\nComparisons of all the sequences show a high-transversion bias (A\n<-> T) even among closely related species. The bias is most\npronounced in third positions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psithyrus and Bombus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1125.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psithyrus and Bombus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1126.phy"}]}
