Soluble receptor isoforms are typically generated by\nproteolytic cleavage of the cell surface receptor or by alternative\nsplicing of RNA transcripts arising from the same gene encoding the\nfull-length receptor. Both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nand the insulin receptor (INSR) families produce soluble receptor splice\nvariants in vertebrates and truncated forms of insulin receptor-like\nsequences have been described previously in Drosophila. The EGFR and\nINSR ectodomains share significant sequence homology suggestive of a\ncommon evolutionary origin. Results: We performed a phylogenetic\nanalysis of the conserved receptor extracellular L1 and L2 subdomains in\ninvertebrate species. We discovered novel truncated insulin\nreceptor-like variants in several arthropod species. While the\nsegregation of insulin receptor-like L1 and L2 domains indicated that an\ninternal domain duplication had occurred only once, the generation of\ntruncated insulin receptor-like sequences apparently has occurred\nmultiple times.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Insulin receptor-like ectodomain genes in Arthropods\nand Humans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60720.phy"}]}
