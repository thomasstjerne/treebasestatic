The systematics of agromyzids\nhas remained poorly known due to their small size and morphological\nhomogeneity. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships among genera\nwithin the Agromyzidae using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of 2965 bp\nof DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene, the nuclear\nribosomal 28S gene, and the single copy nuclear CAD gene. We included 86\nspecies in 21 genera, including all but a few small genera, and spanning\nthe diversity within the family. The results from parsimony and Bayesian\nanalyses were largely similar, with major groupings of genera in common.\nSpecifically, both analyses recovered a monophyletic Phytomyzinae and a\nmonophyletic Agromyzinae. Within the subfamilies, genera found to be\nmonophyletic given our sampling include Agromyza, Amauromyza,\nCalycomyza, Cerodontha, Liriomyza, Melanagromyza, Metopomyza,\nNemorimyza, Phytobia, and Pseudonapomyza. Several genera were found to\nbe polyphyletic or paraphyletic including Aulagromyza, Chromatomyia,\nPhytoliriomyza, Phytomyza, and Ophiomyia. We evaluate our findings and\ndiscuss host-use evolution in light of current agromyzid taxonomy and\ntwo recent hypotheses of relationships based on morphological data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agromyzidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4740.phy"}]}
