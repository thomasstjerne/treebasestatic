Two genera, Australohydnum and Hjortstamia\n, are reduced to synonyms under Phlebiopsis because generic type species\nA. griseofuscescens and H. friesii , respectively, are embedded in the\nPhlebiopsis clade. Twenty-four lineages are resolved in the ITS\nphylogenetic tree of Phlebiopsis , including six new taxa from Sri Lanka\nand China  P. albescens , P. brunnea , P. cylindrospora , P.\nmagnicystidiata , P. membranacea and P. sinensis . Five new combinations\nare proposed  Phaeophlebiopsis mussooriensis , Phlebiopsis bambusicola ,\nP. dregeana , P. griseofuscescens and P. novae-granatae . Phlebiopsis\ncrassa is a morphological species complex with three distinct lineages.\nPhlebiopsis lamprocystidiata is determined to be a later synonym of P.\ndarjeelingensis . The new taxa are described, illustrated, and compared\nand contrasted to morphologically similar species. An emended\ndescription of Phlebiopsis is provided along with an identification key\nto 27 accepted species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128315","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128315.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128317","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128317.phy"}]}
