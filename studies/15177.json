They have effuse white to orange\nstromata. Their teleomorphs are unique in producing a single perithecium\ninside a tubercle resembling Moelleriella raciborskii, a common species\nin Thailand. A combined matrix of nuclear large subunit rRNA gene (LSU)\nand RNA polymerase II subunit one (RPB1) gene shows that both species\ncluster in a distinct lineage as sister to M. raciborskii/ï¿½A.ï¿½\nplacenta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relationships between M. alba, M.\nchumphoensis and related species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69576.phy"}]}
