Among amniotes, genome sequences are\navailable for mammals[2] and birds[3-5], but not for non-avian reptiles.\nHere we report the genome sequence of the North American green anole\nlizard, Anolis carolinensis. We find that A. carolinensis\nmicrochromosomes are highly syntenic with chicken microchromosomes, yet\ndo not exhibit the high GC and low repeat content that are\ncharacteristic of avian microchromosomes[3]. Also, A. carolinensis\nmobile elements are very young and diverse  more so than in any other\nsequenced amniote genome. This lizard genomes GC content is also unusual\nin its homogeneity, unlike the regionally variable GC content found in\nmammals and birds[6]. We describe and assign sequence to the previously\nunknown A. carolinensis X chromosome. Comparative gene analysis shows\nthat amniote egg proteins have evolved significantly more rapidly than\nother proteins. Fewer olfactory receptors, compared to birds and\nmammals, may indicate a reduced sense of smell, while an unusually high\nnumber of opsin genes may contribute to the lizards sophisticated color\nvision. A phylogeny of the Caribbean anoles resolves basal branches to\nilluminate the history of their repeated adaptive radiations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A phylogeny of 93 Anolis species clarifies the\nbiogeographic history of anoles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48945.phy"}]}
