Even though many fungal species have been reported from palm\nhosts, studies on fungi from Arenga tremula are considerably few. In\nthis study, we isolated a saprobic Botryosphaeriaceae species on A.\ntremula, collected from Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.\nMorphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of internal\ntranscribed spacer and the intervening 5.8S nrRNA (ITS), small subunit\nnuclear rRNA gene (SSU), translation elongation factor 1alpha gene (tef\n1-α), and part of the large subunit nuclear rRNA gene (LSU), were\nemployed to identify the species. Based on phylogenetic results and\nmorphology we introduced Neodeightonia arengae sp. nov., with species\ndescription and illustrations. In addition, we provide a comparison of\nmorphological characters of currently accepted Neodeightonia species.\nThis is the first report of Neodeightonia species associated with Arenga\ntremula and the results of this study will contribute to increase the\nknowledge of fungi associated with palm trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134565.phy"}]}
