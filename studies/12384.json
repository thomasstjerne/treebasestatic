This method of systematic evaluation of organismal\nrelationships has caused much taxonomic flux for Alternaria and related\ngenera within Stemphylium, Embellisia, Nimbya, Undifilum, and\nUlocladium. The present study utilizes extensive taxon sampling from 176\nspecies spanning ten genera and molecular phylogenetic analyses of ten\nprotein-coding loci. Results from this work reveal that three genes have\nexperienced substantial substitution saturation at the third codon\nposition and two other genes do not possess sufficient levels of\nphylogenetic informativeness to delineate the order of divergence of\nmany previously described Alternaria species-groups. The combined\nanalysis of five phylogenetically informative protein-coding genes\nstrongly supports nine distinct phylogenetic lineages of Alternaria.\nEight asexual lineages cluster as a strongly supported monophyletic\ngroup sister to the genus Ulocladium, while the sexual members of the\ninfectoria clade cluster with other sexual genera. This work proposes to\nelevate all nine well-supported lineages of Alternaria to the taxonomic\nstatus of Section. Evolutionary relationships among Alternaria and\nclosely related genera are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria gpd","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50948.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria cal","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50963.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria alta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50959.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50958.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria CHS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50964.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50974.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria atp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50961.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria Tsr1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50965.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria EF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50972.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106974","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106974.phy"}]}
