The\nmorphological concept of the genus expanded as new taxa were added, and\nnow studies of zoospore ultrastructure and molecular phylogenies have\nrevealed the genus to be polyphyletic. One such taxon is C. spinosus\nFay, a distinctive species characterized by whorls of spines on the\nzoosporangium and a large accumulation of vesicle material beneath the\noperculum. With light, scanning electron, and transmission electron\nmicroscopy, we examined a culture (WJD186) isolated from a muck sample\ncollected from a temporary forest pond. We also analyzed the D1-D3\nvariable domains of the nuc 28S rDNA (28S) sequences to confirm the\nphylogenetic placement of the species relative to the type of\nChytriomyces, C. hyalinus Karling. The morphology of culture WJD186 is\nconsistent with features Fay described for C. spinosus, and the zoospore\nultrastructure is consistent with the Group I-type zoospore characters\nof Chytriomycetaceae (Chytridiales). In our molecular phylogeny, C.\nspinosus is confirmed as polyphyletic with Chytriomyces. Consequently,\nwe erect a new genus in Chytriomycetaceae and present the new\ncombination Fayochytriomyces spinosus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fayochytriomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89432.phy"}]}
