Partial SSU and\nITS rDNA sequence analysis revealed that these belong to two\nphylogenetic species, each with a pair of morphotypes displaying\nposition specificity. Confirmation of dimorphism in Laboulbeniales\nhighlights the need for a thorough systematic revision of species\nconcepts within the order. The theory of “position specificity” also\nneeds to be re-visited.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr64536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64536.phy"}]}
