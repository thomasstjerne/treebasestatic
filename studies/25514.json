In addition to its ecological\nimportance, A. araucana is relevant for its cultural and socioeconomic\naspects, being a key tree for the Mapuche indigenous people. This\nspecies is endangered due to its uncontrolled logging, its excessive\nharvesting of seeds, and the devastating fires that occurred during the\nlast two centuries. Since 2015, A. araucana has shown an unusual partial\ndeath of the crown, but no evident primary pathogen or pest was\nidentified to be associated with the phenomenon. However, isolates of\nMortierella, a poorly studied fungal genus in Patagonia, were obtained\nfrom the margins of necrotic phloem tissue of symptomatic trees. The aim\nof the present study was to identify the species of Mortierella\nassociated with A. araucaria trees with symptoms of stem disease and to\nevaluate their possible pathogenic role. Six species of Mortierella were\nisolated from tissue affected. Results showed that M. alpina and M. aff.\nbasiparvispora were pathogenic to A. araucana, demonstrating the\ninvolvement of Mortierellales in the decline of the tree.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morrtierella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121735.phy"}]}
