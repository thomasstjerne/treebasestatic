(Davidiaceae), commonly known\nas âChinese dove treeâ, is a rare and endangered species endemic to\nChina. Little is known about the genetic structure and population\nhistory of D. involucrata. Both cpDNA and nSSR markers showed high\ngenetic diversity among D. involucrata populations (HS = 0.717; hT =\n0.893; pT = 3.14 Ã 10-3). The genetic divergence of all D. involucrata\npopulations was significantly higher in the cpDNA (FST = 0.765) than in\nthe nuclear DNA (FST = 0.239), possibly reflecting a more important role\nof pollen dispersal than the seed in the formation of the genetic\nstructure of Davidia. Phylogeographic analyses suggested that the\npopulations of D. involucrata were divided into the eastern and western\nlineages with the Sichuan Basin as the boundary, separating the\nSino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese Forest subkingdoms. Divergence of the\ntwo lineages was estimated to have occurred around 4.81 Mya during the\nLate Miocene/Early Pliocene. Mismatch distribution and neutrality tests\ndidn’t show significant population growth and range expansion in either\nlineage, suggesting the in situ survival of multiple populations during\nthe Quaternary glaciation without range expansion. There are two\npotential refugia of Davidia involucrata in Southwest and Central China\nand natural reserves need to be established to preserve the genetic\ndiversity of the species in the refugia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis based on cpDNA sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis based on cpDNA sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BEAST-derived chronograms of Davidia and its outgroup\nbased on cpDNA (trnLâ“rpl32F, trnSâ“trnG) sequences with fossil-based\nnode constrains","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86171.phy"}]}
