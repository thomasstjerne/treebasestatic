Partial sequences of 19\nspecies were generated and aligned with 31 sequences retrieved from\nGenBank. Our results confirm with strong support that Nadvornikia\nbelongs to the Thelotremataceae (Ostropales). The placement of Pyrgillus\nin the Pyrenulaceae (Pyrenulales) is also strongly supported. The\nPyrenulaceae form a strongly supported monophyletic group that is sister\nto the non-lichenized Chaetothyriales. The Thelotremataceae are a\nsignificantly supported monophyletic group with Graphidaceae nested\nwithin. The phylogeny within Thelotremataceae is only partially resolved\nwith the single data set.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nadvornikia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_291.phy"}]}
