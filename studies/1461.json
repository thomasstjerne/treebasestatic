Numerous species are widely distributed\nand well-known, including important bioindicators for atmospheric\npollution. The phylogeny and classification of parmelioid lichens has\nbeen a matter of debate for several decades. Previous studies using\nmolecular data have helped to establish hypotheses of the phylogeny of\ncertain clades within the parmelioid lichens. In this study, we infer\nphylogeny of major clades of parmelioid lichens using two nuclear and\none mitochondrial loci from 145 specimens (119 species) representing the\nmorphological and chemical diversity in these taxa. A core group of\nparmelioid lichens is strongly supported as monophyletic, excluding\nArtoparmelia and Melanelia p.p., and including Parmeliopsis and\nParmelaria. Within this group, seven well supported clades are found,\nbut the relationships among them remain unresolved. Stochastic mapping\non a MC/MCMC tree sampling was employed to study the evolution of two\nmorphological and two chemical traits that are believed to be important\nfor the successful survival of these lichens, and have also been\nemployed as major characters for classification. The results suggest\nthat these characters have been gained and lost several times during the\nevolution of parmelioid lichens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parmelioid lichens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_654.phy"}]}
