We\nshow that it is not an actual member of the genus Heleococcum (order\nHypocreales) as stated before and should, therefore, be excluded from it\nand renamed. Multi-locus gene phylogeny analyses (based on nuclear ITS,\n5.8S rDNA, 28S rDNA, 18S rDNA, RPB2 and TEF1-alpha) have displayed this\nfungus as a new taxon at the genus level within the family\nPlectosphaerellaceae, Hypocreomycetidae, Ascomycota. The reference\nspecies of actual Heleococcum members showed clear divergence from the\nstrongly supported Heleococcum alkalinum position within the\nPlectosphaerellaceae, sister to the family Glomerellaceae. Eighteen\nstrains isolated from soda lakes around the world show remarkable\ngenetic similarity promoting speculations on their possible evolution in\nharsh alkaline environments. We established the pH growth optimum of\nthis alkaliphilic fungus at c. pH 10 and tested growth on 30 carbon\nsources at pH 7 and 10. The new genus and species, Sodiomyces alkalinus\ngen. nov. comb. nov., is the second holomorphic fungus known within the\nfamily, the first one being Plectosphaerella â some members of this\ngenus are known to be alkalitolerant. We propose the\nPlectosphaerellaceae family to be the source of alkaliphilic filamentous\nfungi as also the species known as Acremonium alcalophilum belongs to\nthis group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI 5 genes","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_55240.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML 5 genes","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_55241.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML 2 genes","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_54540.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI 2genes","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_54539.phy"}]}
