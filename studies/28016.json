In phalloids, the first DNA sequence was\npublished in 1997, and after that, some studies aimed to resolve\nphylogenetic conflicts and propose new species based on DNA markers;\nhowever, the number of families and genera in the order still generates\ncontroversies among researchers. Thus, this work aims to provide an\noverview of Phallales diversity represented by selected DNA markers\navailable in public databases. We retrieved Phallales sequences from DNA\ndatabases (GenBank and UNITE) of seven markers: ITS (internal\ntranscribed spacer), nuc-LSU (nuclear large subunit rDNA), nuc-SSU\n(nuclear small subunit rDNA), mt-SSU (mitochondrial small subunit rDNA),\nATP6 (ATPase subunit 6), RPB2 (nuclear protein-coding second largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase), and TEF1-α (translation elongation factor\nsubunit 1α). To compose our final dataset, all ITS sequences retrieved\nwere subjected to BLASTn searches to identify additional ITS sequences\nnot classified as Phallales. Phylogenetic analyses based on Bayesian and\nmaximum likelihood approaches using single and combined markers were\nconducted. All ITS sequences were clustered with a cutoff of 98% in\norder to maximize the number of species hypotheses. The geographic\norigin of sequences was retrieved, as well as additional information on\nspecies lifestyle and edibility. We obtained a total of 1,149 sequences,\nrepresenting 664 individuals. Sequences of 41 individuals were\nunidentified at genus level and were assigned to five distinct families.\nWe recognize seven families and 22 genera in Phallales, although the\ndelimitation of some genera must be further revisited in order to\nrecognize only monophyletic groups. Many inconsistencies in species\nidentification are discussed, and the positioning of genera in each\nfamily is shown. The clustering revealed 118 species hypotheses, meaning\nthat approximately 20% of all described species in Phallales have DNA\nsequences available. Information related to geographic distribution\nrepresents 462 individuals distributed in 46 countries on all\ncontinents, except Antarctica. Most genera are saprotrophic with only\none putative ectomycorrhizal genus, and 2.1% of the legitimate specific\nnames recognized in Phallales are confirmed edible species. Great\nprogress in the molecular analyses of phalloids has already been made\nover these years, but it is still necessary to solve some taxonomic\ninconsistencies, mainly at genus level, and generate new data to expand\nknowledge of the group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BAY","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136219.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136216.phy"},{"tree_label":"MV","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136220.phy"},{"tree_label":"MV","ntax":"481","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136218.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"306","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136221.phy"},{"tree_label":"BAY","ntax":"481","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136217.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136224.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136223.phy"},{"tree_label":"MV","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136222.phy"}]}
