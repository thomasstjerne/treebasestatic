In this study, we\nreview the diversity and relationships of the Newnesiidae using an\nexpanded taxon sampling with broader geographical coverage including the\nRoss Sea, Weddell Sea, and the Drake Passage (Atlantic and Pacific sides\nof the Antarctic continent). An integrative taxonomic approach combining\nmorphological and molecular phylogenetics is used. The trophic\nrelationships of the family are studied for the first time using gut\ncontent analysis and scanning electron microscopy. A new species from\nabyssal depths is described, namely Newnesia abyssalis sp. nov., and the\nnew genus Hocius gen. nov. is erected to reflect the phylogeny and the\nunique traits of the species H. joani (e.g.Â presence of an internal\nshell). The type species N. antarctica is redescribed based on specimens\nfrom the type locality. The diet results were not entirely conclusive\nbut suggest diatoms to be the predominant food source, which would\nconfirm herbivory as the plesiomorphic condition in Cephalaspidea\ngastropods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Newnesiidae Bayesian phylogeny of the cephalaspidean\nfamilies studied here based on the combined analyses of the\nmitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA and the nuclear 28S rRNA and H3\ngenes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105276.phy"}]}
