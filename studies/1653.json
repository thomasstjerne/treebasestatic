During our study\non diversity of palmicolous fungi in northern Thailand, we encountered\nthree new species of Oxydothis. Oxydothis cyrtostachicola sp. nov., O.\nwallichianensis sp. nov., and O. inaequalis sp. nov. are described and\nillustrated in this paper. The three novel species differ from other\nmorphologically similar Oxydothis species in ascomata shape and ostiole\nposition, ascal ring, and ascospore morphology. Phylogenetic\naffiliations of the new taxa with members of related ascomycete families\nwithin the Xylariales are discussed based on morphology and nrDNA\nsequence data. The phylogenetic relationships of Oxydothis and its\nfamilial placement are still obscure based on the 28S nrDNA sequence\nanalyses.28S nrDNA genes sequences do not provide significant\nphylogenetic information into the evolutionary relationships of these\nxylariaceous fungi. ITS nrDNA sequence analyses, however, indicate that\nOxydothis is more closely related to members of the Amphisphaeriaceae\nthan Diatrypaceae and Xylariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 17 MP boot","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MP tree 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MP boot","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MP tree 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17 MP tree 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17 MP tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17 MB majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MP tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MB majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 18 MP tree 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxydothis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2584.phy"}]}
