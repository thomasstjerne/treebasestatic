A new\ngenus, Cosmosporella, is described to accommodate C. olivacea as its\ntype species. Cosmospora obscura is transferred to Cosmosporella based\non morphological similarities and phylogenetic support. Aquanectria\njacinthicolor, a freshwater lignicolous taxon, characterized by its\norange ascomata and ellipsoid ascospores with broad paraphyses is a\nnewly described freshwater species. This species has affinities with\nother two known species of Aquanectria and can be distinguished based on\nascospore morphology. A specimen with sexual morph of Fusicolla\naquaeductuum is reported for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectriaceae BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128346.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cosmospora BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128347.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cosmospora MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128348.phy"}]}
