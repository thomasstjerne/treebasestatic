A comprehensive\nunderstanding of the gene families associated with drought tolerance is\ntherefore highly relevant. NAC transcription factors are a large\nplant-specific gene family involved in the regulation of tissue\ndevelopment and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The main goal\nof this study was to set up a framework of Orthologous Groups (OGs)\ndetermined by an expert sequence comparison of NAC genes from both\nmonocots (O. sativa and Musa acuminata) and dicots (V. vinifera and A.\nthaliana). In order to clarify the orthologous relationships among NAC\ngenes of different species, we performed an in-depth comparative study\nof four divergent taxa, in dicots and monocots, whose genomes already\nbeen completely sequenced: Arabidopsis thaliana, Vitis vinifera, Musa\nacuminata and Oryza sativa. Due to independent evolution, NAC copy\nnumber is highly variable in these plant genomes. Based on an expert NAC\nsequence comparison, we propose forty orthologous groups of NAC\nsequences that were probably derived from an ancestor gene present in\nthe most recent common ancestor of dicots and monocots. These\northologous groups provide a curated resource for large-scale protein\nsequence annotation of NAC transcription factors. The established\northology relationships also provide a useful reference for NAC function\nstudies in newly sequenced genomes such as Musa acuminata and other\nplant species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"OG1h","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66732","tree_kind":"Gene
