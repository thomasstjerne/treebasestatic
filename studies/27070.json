However, the\ngenus Cytospora primarily cause canker diseases of woody host plants,\nleading to the growth weakness or death of plant hosts and causing\nsignificant economic and ecological losses. In this study, we provided\nan assessment of 11 Cytospora spp. represented by 28 fungal strains from\nsymptomatic branches or twigs of coniferous trees, i.e., Juniperus\nprocumbens, Juniperus przewalskii, Picea crassifolia, Pinus armandii,\nPinus bungeana, Platycladus orientalis in China. Through morphological\nobservation and multilocus phylogeny of ITS, LSU, act, rpb2, tef1-Î± and\ntub2 gene sequences, the present study focused on four novel species\n(Cytospora albodisca, C. discostoma, C. donglinensis and C. verrucosa)\nassociated with Platycladus orientalis. This study represented the first\nattempt to clarify the taxonomy of Cytospora species associated with\ncanker and dieback symptoms of coniferous trees in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"238","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129504.phy"}]}
