However,\nthe relationships among its main lineages (families and subfamilies) and\nthe timing of their origin are not sufficiently understood to explain\nhow this tropical clade has been able to colonize the temperate zone.\nHere, we used transcriptomics and divergence time dating to investigate\nthe phylogeny of Gonyleptoidea. Our results support the monophyly of\nGonyleptoidea and all of its families with more than one species\nrepresented. Resolution within Gonyleptidae s.s. is achieved for many\nclades, but some subfamilies are not monophyletic (Gonyleptinae,\nMitobatinae, and Pachylinae), requiring taxonomic revision. Our data\nshow evidence for one colonization of todays temperate zone early in the\nhistory of Gonyleptidae, during the Paleogene, at a time when the\nNeotropical area extended poleward into regions now considered\ntemperate. This provides a possible mechanism for the colonization of\nthe extratropics by a tropical group following the PaleoceneEocene\nThermal Maximum, explaining how latitudinal diversity gradients can be\nestablished. Taxonomic acts: Ampycidae Kury 2003 is newly ranked as\nfamily; Neosadocus Mello-Leitão is transferred to Progonyleptoidellinae\n(new subfamilial assignment).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armored Harvestmen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130399.phy"}]}
