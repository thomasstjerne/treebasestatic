Karst. (≡ Cortinarius). Molecular phylogenetic analysis of nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large ribosomal subunit\n(LSU) and RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB2) sequences\nindicates that D. majestatica is nested within the genus Cortinarius,\nwith its closest relative a sequestrate Cortinarius species from\nArgentina. Taxonomic recombination is made to restore the monophyly of\nCortinarius and Descolea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius majestaticus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93333.phy"}]}
