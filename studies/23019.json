We could not locate any type\nmaterial for this species and there is no molecular data available for\nthe type of this species. Therefore, an epitype is designated for the\nprecise delineation of this taxon. A detailed morphological description\nand DNA characterization based on LSU, SSU, ITS rDNA and TEF1 sequence\ndata are provided for the epitype, obtained from Spartina culms in\nEastney, Langstone Harbour, Hampshire, UK.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halobyssothecium LSU SSU TEF ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113014.phy"}]}
