Inoculum is commonly found in most\ncontainer and bare-root nurseries on healthy and diseased seedlings, in\nnursery soils, and on conifer seeds. Isolates of F. oxysporum can differ\nin virulence; however, virulence and colony morphology are not\ncorrelated. Forty-one isolates of F. oxysporum collected from nursery\nsamples (soils, healthy seedlings, and diseased seedlings) were\ncharacterized by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and DNA\nsequencing of nuclear rDNA (internal transcribed spacer including 5.8S\nrDNA), mitochondrial rDNA (small subunit: mtSSU), and nuclear\ntranslation elongation factor 1รก. Each isolate had a unique AFLP\nphenotype. Out of 121 loci, 111 (92%) were polymorphic; 30 alleles were\nunique to only highly virulent isolates and 33 alleles were unique to\nonly non-pathogenic isolates. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of\nDNA sequences from all three regions and the combined dataset showed\nthat all highly virulent isolates separated into a common clade, with\n100% bootstrap and posterior probability support. The AFLP cladograms\nhad similar topologies when compared to the DNA-based phylograms.\nSeveral AFLP genetic markers and mtSSU sequences offer potential for\ndevelopment of molecular markers that could be used to detect highly\nvirulent isolates of F. oxysporum in forest nurseries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MB","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2455.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 MP","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2452.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 MB","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2453.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MP","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2454.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2449.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2450.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 MP","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2456.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 MB","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2457.phy"}]}
