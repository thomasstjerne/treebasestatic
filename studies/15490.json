Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the skin of the\n109-year-old paratype specimen is nearly identical (0.3% cytochrome-b\ndivergence) to that extracted from 2 newly captured specimens.\nPhylogenetic analyses of the complete cytochrome-b gene and 2 nuclear\ngenes show O. lanius to be sister to the geographically widespread\nspecies O. hispidus. O. lanius has a diploid number of 44 and a\nfundamental number of 84, and the species is easily distinguished from\nO. hispidus by its larger size and long, dense pelage. Our observations\nsuggest that O. lanius is reasonably abundant in a roughly 1,000 km2\nregion of central Veracruz, where it persists in forested refugia often\ntoo steep and rugged for cultivation by humans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71583","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71583.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71582","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71582.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71584","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71584.phy"}]}
