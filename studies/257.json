Cladistic\nanalysis of 60 characters supports the monophyly of both Tetragnathidae\nand Tetragnathinae. New data from spinneret silk gland spigots, combined\nwith other morphological and behavioural characters, provide the first\nconcrete evidence that ‘metine’ genera, occasionally regarded as either\na distinct family or subfamily, are a paraphyletic assemblage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 30","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orbiculariae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1318.phy"}]}
