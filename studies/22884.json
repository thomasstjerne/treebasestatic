Monosporascus cannonballus is the\nmost well-known species of the genus, and an important root pathogen\nassociated with the vine decline ofmelon and watermelon crops worldwide.\nThe aim of the present study was to characterise a col-lection of 35\nMonosporascus-like isolates recovered from roots of two weed species\nprevalentin cucurbit growing fields in Northeastern Brazil: Boerhavia\ndiffusa and Trianthema portulacas-trum. These isolates were identified\nbased on DNA sequences of the Internal Transcribed Spacerregions (ITS)\nof the nuclear rDNA, part of the translation elongation factor gene\n(tef-1α), part ofthe β-tubulin gene (tub), part of the nuclear small\nsubunit (SSU) rDNA and part of the largesubunit (LSU) rDNA. Five\nMonosporascus species, namely Monosporascus brasiliensis, Monospor-ascus\ncaatinguensis, Monosporascus mossoroensis, Monosporascus nordestinus and\nMonosporascussemiaridus, are newly described. Monosporascus\nbrasiliensis, M. nordestinus and M. semiariduswere isolated from both\nweed species, while M. caatinguensis only from T. portulacastrum andM.\nmossoroensis only from B. diffusa. The present study confirms that\nMonosporascus spp. cancolonise roots of very diverse hosts, even without\ncausing noticeable disease symptoms, andreveals that the diversity of\nspecies in the genus Monosporascus is potentially greater than\nprevi-ously expected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113333","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113333.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113335","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113336.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113337","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113337.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113334.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113338","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113338.phy"}]}
