Despite ecological and\ncytogenetic significance, phylogenetic relationships among genera and\nspecies remain uncertain. In particular, variation in inflorescence\nmorphology has confounded classification and taxonomy. The presence of\nself compatible and incompatible species allowed us to test the\nhypothesis that self compatible species will have condensed\ninflorescences. We constructed a molecular phylogeny for 85 taxa in\nCommelinaceae, with sampling focused in the Tradescantia alliance.\nConstraint tests supported only subtribe Tradescantiae, Tripogandra and\nTinantia as monophyletic with Tripogandra nested within Callisia. We\nestimated ancestral states for both breeding system and inflorescence\ncondensation and tested for correlation. Inflorescence morphology, an\nimportant character for generic identification, is more labile than\npreviously expected, with condensed inflorescences evolving twice with\nthree subsequent reversals. Breeding system evolution is more complex,\nwith many more switches between self compatible and incompatible and\nmore uncertainty in ancestral state estimates. While we did not find\ncorrelation between self compatibility and inflorescence condensation,\nwe propose additional floral and inflorescence characteristics which may\nhave contributed to variation in breeding system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"constrained Thyrsantheminae","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74581.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Tradescantiinae","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74580.phy"},{"tree_label":"unconstrained","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74579.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Gibasis","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74583.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Tradescantia","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74582.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Tinantia","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74586.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Tripogandra","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74585.phy"},{"tree_label":"constrained Callisia","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia alliance rpL16 trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74584.phy"}]}
