The type specimens have\nrepeatedly been classified as subspecies of G. gazella, G. dorcas or a\ndistinct species since their first description about 180 years ago.\nEspecially the skull is causing problems, as no similar gazelle\nindividual has ever been found. We unravel the identity of G. arabica by\nsequencing two mitochondrial markers from the skull and skin which\nconstitute the G. arabica lectotype and by performing a phylogenetic\nanalysis of the genus. The results show that the lectotype skull and\nskin are not derived from the same animal. They belong to two\nindividuals representing the two monophyletic lineages within the\nMountain gazelle clade, Gazella gazella. By tracing the taxonomic\nhistory of G. arabica and following the rules of the ICZN we are able to\nresolve the hypodigm of G. arabica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus CR","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51122","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51122.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus cytb","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51121","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51121.phy"}]}
