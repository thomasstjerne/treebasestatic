A cladistic\nanalysis of the generic relationships is also presented. The synonymy\nand status of the taxa of each genus is presented and most genera are\nillustrated. Many well known genera like Gnaphalium and Helichrysum are\nshown to be polyphyletic and composed of several smaller monophyletic\nentities. The following new genera are described: Bracteantha,\nEwartiothamnus Langebergia, Humeocline, Oxylaena, and Srenophalium. A\nnumber of names are again recognized at the generic level: Trichogyne,\nEuchiton, Gamochaeta, Homognaphalium, Gnaphaliothamnus,\nPseudognaphalium, Anaphaloides, Leptotriche, Chrysocephalum,\nLawrencella, Rhodanthe, Hyalosperma, Gilberta, Polycalymma, Ozothamnus,\nPsychrophyton. The two new subtribes Loricariinae and Cassiniinae are\ndescribed and the subtribes Angianthinae and Relhaniinae are transferred\nto the Gnaphalieae from the Inuleae. At the species level, 166 new\ncombinations are made. and four new names are presented for taxa with\nillegitimate names: Aliella bracteata, Cladochaeta velutina Gamochaeta\ncabrerae, and Pseudognaphalium biolettii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_435.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6, 7, 8, 9","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnaphalieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1584.phy"}]}
