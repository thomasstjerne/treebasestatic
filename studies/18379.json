They are soilborne fungi\nwhich lack host specificity and invade the plant systemically causing\nwilt symptoms. In this work, we functionally characterized an APSES\nfamily transcription factor, which we designated Vst1, in two\nVerticillium species; V. dahliae, main causal agent of Verticillium wilt\nwhich produces highly durable microsclerotia, and V. nonalfalfae, a\nresting mycelium producing species. We showed that Vst1 is required for\nmicrosclerotium biogenesis and plays a critical role in melanin\nsynthesis which is independent from its role in morphogenesis.\nGeneration of the characteristic verticillate conidiophore was also\nfully dependent on\nVst1 activity. Furthermore, sporulation rates in liquid medium were\ngreatly reduced in the mutants of both species. Yet these strains were\nfully pathogenic in two different hosts. Comparison of Vst1 functions\nand those of previously characterized components of G-protein signaling\nsuggest that both regulate conidiation and microsclerotium biogenesis\nbut playing opposite roles. We propose that strains with altered Vst1\nactivity can be used in Verticillium species as tools to analyze at the\nmolecular level developmental processes which play a role in the disease\ncycle and might therefore be a target for disease control.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91754","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91754.phy"}]}
