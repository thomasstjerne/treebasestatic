Comments on the new\nspecies are presented with a key to the species of the genus. We\nestimated phylogenetic relationships using nrITS sequence data to\nconfirm that this species is a member of Gastrodieae. The results\nindicate with high support in both maximum parsimony (MP) and\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) analyses that it is a member of this tribe.\nFinding a new species in a relatively well-collected place such as\nParanÃ¡ State supports the status of high diversity hotspot for the\nAtlantic Forest and demonstrates the need for more fieldwork on orchids\nand other families.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Uleiorchis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79415.phy"}]}
