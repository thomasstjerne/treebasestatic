The new species was similar to C.\npuertoricensis, and it was provisionally identified C. parvula in Puerto\nRico (both previously assigned to C. parvula) in having cylindrical and\nerect thalli, conspicuous main axes, opposite branching and urceolate\ncystocarps; however, it differed from those two entities in its\noccasional verticils of three lateral branches and absence of\nconspicuous constrictions at diaphragms of main axes and primary\nlaterals. Molecularphylogenetic analyses suggested that the new species\nwas distinct from Japanese ‘C. parvula’ as well as from Puerto Rican ‘C.\nparvula’ and C. puertoricensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Champia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92846.phy"}]}
