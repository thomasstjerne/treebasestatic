In the Indian subcontinent, this genus is represented by 28\nspecies out ofwhich at least 13 are endemic to this region. Here, we\nreport the phylogeny of the Indian Hemidactylusgeckos based on\nmitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers sequenced from multiple\nindividuals of widelydistributed as well as endemic congeners of India.\nResults indicate that a majority of the species distributed in India\nform a distinct clade whose membersare largely confined to the Indian\nsubcontinent thus representing a unique Indian radiation. The remain-ing\nHemidactylus geckos of India belong to two other geographical clades\nrepresenting the SoutheastAsian and West-Asian arid zone species.\nAdditionally, the three widely distributed, commensal species(H.\nbrookii, H. frenatus and H. flaviviridis) are nested within the Indian\nradiation suggesting their Indianorigin. Dispersal-vicariance analysis\nalso supports their Indian origin and subsequent dispersal out-of-India\ninto West-Asian arid zone and Southeast Asia. Thus, Indian subcontinent\nhas served as an importantarena for diversification amongst the\nHemidactylus geckos and in the evolution and spread of its commensal\ngeckos.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP NJ","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20657.phy"}]}
