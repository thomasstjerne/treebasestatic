In this\nstudy, we considered the fungi associated with nine bark beetle species\nand one weevil infesting two native tree species (Pinus sylvestris and\nPinus nigra) and non-native Pinus radiata in Cantabria (Northern Spain).\nThis included examination of 239 bark beetles or their galleries.\nIsolations yielded a total of 110 cultures that included 11 fungal\nspecies (five species of Leptographium sensu lato including\nLeptographium absconditum sp. nov., five species of Ophiostoma sensu\nlato including Ophiostoma cantabriense sp. nov, and one species of\nGraphilbum). The most commonly encountered fungal associates of the bark\nbeetles were Grosmannia olivacea, Leptographium procerum, and Ophiostoma\ncanum. The aggressiveness of the collected fungal species was evaluated\nusing inoculations on two-year-old P. radiata seedlings. Leptographium\nwingfieldii, L. guttulatum, and O. ips were the only species capable of\ncausing significant lesions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CALMODULIN","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae CAL pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69790.phy"},{"tree_label":"BTabsconditum","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae BT absconditum pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69792.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae ITS pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69794.phy"},{"tree_label":"BTcantabriense","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae BT cantabriense pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69789.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1-alpha","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae EF1-alpha pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69793.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2-LSU","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae ITS2-LSU pn bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69791.phy"}]}
