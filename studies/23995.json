These complex dynamics and\ninteractions between the Andes and Amazonia have likely had a major\ninfluence on the trajectory of Neotropical biodiversity, but evidence\nfrom time-calibrated phylogenies of groups that diversified during this\nperiod are lacking. We investigate the role of these landscape\ntransformations on the dynamics of diversification in the Neotropical\nregion using a 26 My-old endemic butterfly radiation. We generated one\nof the most comprehensive time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of a\nlarge clade of Neotropical insects, the butterfly tribe Ithomiini,\ncomprising 340 species (87% of extant species) and spanning 26 My of\ndiversification. We applied a large array of birth-death models and\nhistorical biogeography estimations to assess the dynamics of\ndiversification and biotic interchanges, especially at the\nAmazonia/Andes interface. Our results suggest that the Amazonian Pebas\nwetland system played a major role in the timing and geography of\ndiversification of Ithomiini, by constraining dispersal and\ndiversification in the Amazon basin until ~10 My ago. During the Pebas\nwetland period Ithomiini diversification mostly took place in the Andes,\nwhere terrestrial habitats where not affected. An explosion of\ninterchanges with Amazonia and with the Northern Andes accompanied the\ndemise of the Pebas system (11-8 My ago), and was followed by local\ndiversification in those areas, which led to a substantial renewal of\ndiversification. While many studies on Neotropical diversity have\nfocused only on the Andes, we show that it is the waxing and waning of\nthe Pebas mega-wetland, interacting with Andean uplift, that have\ndetermined the timing and patterns of regional interchanges and\ndiversification in Ithomiini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP
