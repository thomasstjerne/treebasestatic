Pryor","Year":" 2011","Title":" Nimbya and Embellisia revisited, with nov. comb for\nAlternaria celosiae and A. perpunctulata","Journal":" Mycological Progress","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Nimbya, Embellisia, systematics, phylogeny","DOI":"","Abstract":" Previous phylogenetic analyses revealed that species\nwithin the genera Nimbya and Embellisia reside within a large\nmonophyletic clade that also includes the genera Alternaria, Ulocladium,\nUndifilum, Sinomyces, and Crivellia with Stemphylium as the sister\ntaxon. This study expandeds upon previous work by including many\ncontemporary species for each genus and by utilizing molecular and\nmorphological characters to further examine relationships. Maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian analyses reveals that Nimbya is not a\nmonophyletic genus but is split into two phylogenetically distant\nclades, which have different and distinct conidial morphologies. One of\nthese clades resides completely within Alternaria. Phylogenetic analyses\nalso reveals that Embellisia does not form a monophyletic genus but is\nsplit into four monophyletic lineages. Moreover, several species of\nEmbellisia cluster individually with clades that are predominantly\nAlternaria, Ulocladium, or Stemphylium, yet these Embellisia spp.\npossess morphological characters that are diagnostically Embellisia.\nThus, these data reveal that both Nimbya and Embellisia are polyphyletic\nas currently defined and taxonomic restructuring is necessary in order\nto resolve conflict between historical morphological and contemporary\nmolecular-based phylogenies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nimbya and Embellisia
