The\ndiagnostically important anamorph of this species is described here in\ndetail for the first time. Sequence analyses of the rDNA ITS region and\nD1/D2 domains of the 28S rDNA were carried out in this study to obtain\nfirst phylogenetic data for and taxonomic conclusions for this species.\nThe structure of the anamorph (Oidium subgen. Pseudoidium) and the\nmolecular data support the placement of this species in Erysiphe emend.\n(incl. Microsphaera) as a separate species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribe Erysipheae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1004.phy"}]}
