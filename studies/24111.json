Phaeoseptum mali can be distinguished\nfrom other species of Phaeoseptum by its completely immersed and larger\nascomata and asci size. Descriptions and illustrations of P. mali are\nprovided. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined dataset of LSU, SSU, ITS,\ntef1, and rpb2 sequence data confirmed its placement within\nPhaeoseptaceae and basal to P. aquaticum and P. terricola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116409","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_116409.phy"}]}
