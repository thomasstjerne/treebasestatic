Allicin facilitates garlic defense against pests and\nproduces health-promoting compounds. Alliinase is encoded by members of\na multigene family that has not yet been sufficiently characterized,\nnamely with regard to the copy numbers occurring within the genome and\nthe polymorphisms among the family members.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87458","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87458.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S1","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87459","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87459.phy"}]}
