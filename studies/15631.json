Here we\nstudy 100 alkalitolerant and alkaliphilic isolates from the soils around\nthe basin of soda lakes in Asia and Africa to assess the major\nevolutionary lineages and morphologies pertinent to the alkaliphilic\ntrait in filamentous fungi. The Emericellopsis lineage (Hypocreales,\nHypocreomycetidae), along with Plectosphaerellaceae (Hypocreomycetidae),\nPleosporaceae (Dothideomycetes), Chaetomiaceae (Sordariomycetidae)\nfamilies appeared to be overrepresented with strong alkalitolerants and\neffective alkaliphiles. In particular, Sodiomyces species\n(Plectosphaerellaceae), Acrostalagmus luteoalbus (Plectosphaerellaceae),\nEmericellopsis alkalina (Hypocreales), Thielavia sp. (Chaetomiaceae),\nand Alternaria sect. Soda (Pleosporaceae) grew best at high ambient pH.\nThe pH tolerance of Chordomyces antarcticum, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus\nand some other species was largely affected by the presence of extra Na+\nin the growth medium. Moderate alkalitolerants included Scopulariopsis\nmembers (Microascales), Fusarium, Cladosporium, and many asexual\nacremonium-like species from Bionectriaceae. Weak alkalitolerants were\nrepresented by sporadic isolates of Penicillium, Purpureocillium\nlilacinum, and Alternaria alternata species, with the growth optimum at\nneutral or acidic pH. Weak alkalitolerants develop loose dry chains of\nspores easily dispersed by air. Their presence at low frequency with the\ngrowth optimum at neutral or acidic pH leads us to treat them as\ntransient species in the alkaline soils, as those are also ubiquitous\nsaprobes in normal soils. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the\nalkaliphilic trait in filamentous fungi has evolved several times.\nSeveral lineages harboring strong alkalitolerants derived from the known\nmarine-borne fungi (Emericellopsis, Alternaria sect. Phragmosporae), or\nfall within the fungi associated with halophytic grasses\n(Pleosporaceae). Soda soils contain a diversity of fungi that range from\nweak alkalitolerant to alkaliphilic, which in few cases is associated\nwith darkly pigmented mycelium and formation of microsclerotia. The\nalkaliphilic trait is spread throughout the Ascomycota, and usually\njuxtaposes with slime-covered polyphyletic acremonium-, verticillium-,\ngliocladium-types of asexual morphology, hyphae aggregating in chords,\nand enclosed fruit bodies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi from soda soils SSU LSU RPB2 ITS ML\nPleosporaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72574.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi from soda soils ITS BI Sodiomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72558.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GPD BI section Soda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72575.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_TEF1-a BI Scopulariopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72566.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_ITS ML Chaetomiaceae/Lasiosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72572.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Act_GPD_TS_ITS BI Verticillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72560.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_ITS BI Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72552.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GPD ML section Soda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72576.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_ITS ML Plectosphaerellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72553.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS ML Sodiomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72559.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi from soda soils SSU BI Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72550.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SSU ML Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72551.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Act_GPD_TS_ITS ML Verticillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72561.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_TEF1-a ML Scopulariopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72567.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SSU_LSU_RPB2_ITS BI Pleosporaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72573.phy"},{"tree_label":"50% maj rule cons","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU_ITS BI Chaetomiaceae/Lasiosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72571.phy"}]}
