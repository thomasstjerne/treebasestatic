The\nspecies differs from its congeners in having mucronate utricules. A\nphylogenetic analysis of rbcL and tufA sequences show that P. mucronatum\nis most closely associated with P. natalense and P. devriesii, with\nwhich it shares compressed axes, depressed apices and plastids in the\nutricles and the medullar siphons. We study the evolution of climatic\nand ecological preferences in the genus using an interdisciplinary\napproach consisting of relaxed molecular clock analysis, extraction of\nmacroecological data from satellite imagery in a GIS framework and\nancestral character state estimation. It is shown that the genus\noriginated in tropical waters during the Early Mesozoic. Whereas the P.\nfloridanum-okinawense lineage remained tropical, the lineage including\nP. natalense, P. devriesii and P. mucronatum gradually invaded more\ntemperate waters during Cenozoic times. Except for P. devriesii, which\noccurs in shallow and intertidal habitats, all Pseudocodium species grow\nin deep-water habitats and this ecological preference appears to be\nancestral.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocodium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5484.phy"}]}
