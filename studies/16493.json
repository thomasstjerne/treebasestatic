This edible mushroom has macroscopic characteristics similar to\nthose of Panus lecomtei. In this study, we used evidence obtained from a\nmorphological comparison, molecular analyses and mating tests to clarify\nthe taxonomic status of P. strigellus and show differences compared to\nthe sympatric species of Panus. In addition, this paper discusses and\nreports some yet to be described morphological characteristics of P.\nstrigellus. The tetrapolar mating system of P. strigellus and the\nincompatibility between P. lecomtei and P. strigellus was confirmed. The\ngeographical distributions of both species in the Americas are\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panus 3 RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78382.phy"}]}
