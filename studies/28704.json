Although GRF gene family has been\nidentified in various plant species, a genome-wide analysis of this\nfamily in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) has not been reported yet.\nResults: Here we identified 15 GRF genes in lettuce and performed\ncomprehensive analysis of them, including chromosomal locations, gene\nstructures, and conserved motifs. Through phylogenic analysis, we\ndivided LsaGRFs into six groups. Transactivation assays and subcellular\nlocalization of LsaGRF5 showed that this protein is likely to act as a\ntranscriptional factor in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, transgenic\nlettuce lines overexpressing LsaGRF5 exhibited larger leaves, while\nsmaller leaves were observed in LsaMIR396a overexpression lines, in\nwhich LsaGRF5 was down-regulated. Conclusions: These results in lettuce\nprovide insight into the molecular mechanism of GRF gene family in\nregulating leaf growth and development and foundational information for\ngenetic improvement of the lettuce variations specialized in leaf\ncharacter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133022","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133022.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133021","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133021.phy"}]}
