Ultrastructure and pigment\nanalyses suggest that the two-membrane-bound plastid of Dinophysis spp.\nhas been acquired through endosymbiosis from a cryptophyte. However,\nthese organisms do not survive in culture, raising the possibility that\nDinophysis spp. have a transient kleptoplast. To test the origin and\npermanence of the plastid of Dinophysis, we sequenced plastid-encoded\npsbA and SSU rDNA from single cell isolates of D. acuminata ClaparËde et\nLachman, D. acuta Ehrenberg, and D. norvegica ClaparËde et Lachman.\nPhylogenetic analyses confirm the cryptophyte origin of the plastid.\nPlastid sequences from different populations isolated at different times\nare monophyletic with robust support and show limited polymorphism. DNA\nsequencing also revealed plastid sequences of florideophyte origin,\nindicating that Dinophysis may be feeding on red algae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"algal plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_884.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"algal plastids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_885.phy"}]}
