It\nis characterized by the pale greyish-green thallus, black, lirelliform\nascomata, and 1-septate ascospores of (11) 1216 × (4) 56 (7) μm, all\nfeatures unique within the genus. Despite the unusual combination of\nmorphological characters, phylogenetic analyses using nuLSU, mtSSU and\nRPB2 sequences place the new lichen in the genus Sagiolechia with full\nsupport.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ostropales s. lat. 3gen 53tax","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125136.phy"}]}
