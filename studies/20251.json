{"Authors":" Lulu Shen","Year":" 2017","Title":" Taxonomy and phylogeny of the brown-rot fungi: Postia and its\nrelated genera","Journal":" Fungal diversity","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Fomitopsidaceae, Multi-marker analyses, Phylogeny,\nTaxonomy, Wood-inhabiting fungi","DOI":"","Abstract":" Phylogenetic and taxonomic studies on the brown-rot fungi,\nPostia and its related genera, are carried out. Based on multiple loci\nDNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions,\nthe large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA\ngene (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene (tef1), the\nlargest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb1) and the second subunit of\nRNA polymerase II (rpb2), our phylogeny recognizes ten distantly related\nclades of Postia sensu lato. Four new genera, Amaropostia, Calcipostia,\nCystidiopostia and Fuscopostia, are established, nine new species,\nAmaropostia hainanensis, Cyanosporus fusiformis, C. microporus, C.\nmongolicus, C. piceicola, C. subhirsutus, C. tricolor, C. ungulatus and\nPostia sublowei, are identified. Illustrated descriptions of the new\ngenera and species are described. Identification keys to Postia and its\nrelated genera, as well as keys to the species of each genus are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100049","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100049.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100055.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100056","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100056.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100057","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100057.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100059","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100059.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100060","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100060.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100061","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100061.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100062.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100063.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100064.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100065.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100066.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100067","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100067.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100068.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100069.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100070.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100071.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100072","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100072.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100073","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100073.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100074","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100074.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100075.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100076.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100077.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 361","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100080.phy"}]}
