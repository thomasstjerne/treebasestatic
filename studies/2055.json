In a recent survey of diseases and insect pests of\nconifer trees in Bhutan, the root collar weevil, Hylobitelus\nchenkupdorjii was found girdling young Himalayan blue pine (Pinus\nwallichiana) trees in Central Bhutan. Intensive wood staining and a\nLeptographium sp. were associated with damage by this insect. The fungus\nwas also isolated from individuals of H. chenkupdorjii. It was\ntentatively identified based on morphology and then compared with other\nLeptographium spp. using DNA sequences for three gene regions.\nMorphological characteristics showed that the Leptographium sp. from H.\nchenkupdorjii is similar to, but distinct from L. procerum and L.\nprofanum. DNA sequence comparisons revealed that the isolates from\nBhutan resided in a distinct well-supported clade, and confirmed that\nthey represent an undescribed taxon for which the name Leptographium\nbhutanense sp. nov. is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptographium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5187.phy"}]}
