Geastrum oberwinkleri morphologically resembles G. fimbriatum\nand G. argentinum in having sessile endosperidium and indistinctly\ndelimited peristome. But G. oberwinkleri can be distinguished by\nbasidiospore size and encrusting debris on mycelial layer surface. The\ncombined dataset of ITS, LSU nrDNA, rpb1 and atp6 were used in\nphylogenetic analysis. The morphological and phylogenetic analysis as\nwell as the features of phenoloxidases showed that this species is a new\nmember of Geastrum sect. Exareolata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121568.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121569.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121570","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121570.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121571","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121571.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121572","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121572.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121573","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121573.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121574","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121574.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121575","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121575.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121576","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121576.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121577","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121577.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121578","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121578.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121579","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121579.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121580","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121580.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121581","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121581.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121582","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121582.phy"}]}
