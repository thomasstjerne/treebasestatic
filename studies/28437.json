Its unique combination of struc- tural characters and ITS rDNA\nsequences suggests a new species, described here as C. ushimanum. Light\nand transmission electron microscopic observations revealed tubular\nintracellular haustoria penetrating longitudinally within the\ncyanobacterial cells, a feature typically seen in the related genus\nDictyonema, but unusual in Cyphellostereum. The generic circumscription\nof Cyphellostereum was therefore emended to include features of C.\nushimanum and other recently described species that deviate from the\nconventional definition of the genus. Ultrastructural details of\nsymbiont interactions are provided for the first time in this genus. We\nalso succeeded in cultivating the fungus from hyphae regenerated from\nthallus fragments, and include a brief description of those\nresults.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131967.phy"}]}
