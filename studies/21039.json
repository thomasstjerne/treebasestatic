We examine plastome organization and RNA editing in ferns, an\nancient lineage of vascular plants, and report changes that add valuable\ninformation on plastome evolution in land plants.  METHODS: Using\nnext-generation sequencing methods we fully sequenced plastomes from\nthree Schizaeaceae species, and compared their plastomes with other\ngroups of land plants to study changes in gene composition, plastome\narchitecture, and putative RNA editing sites. We also performed Maximum\nLikelihood and Bayesian Inference phylogenetic analyzes using 46\nplastid-encoded genes, including 26 ferns, two gymnosperms and five\nangiosperms.  KEY RESULTS: Within the Schizaeaceae, plastomes were\nsimilar to each other in gene content and architecture. Striking changes\ncompared with other ferns include the complete loss of ndh genes and\nreduction of the small single copy. Putative RNA editing was identified\nin all three plastomes, a characteristic that is shared with other fern\ngroups. The monophyly of Schizaeales and Schizaeaceae was\nconfirmed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104284.phy"}]}
