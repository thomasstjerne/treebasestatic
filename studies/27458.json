Although the phylogeny of Panorpidae was conducted by DNA\nsequences recently, the morphological phylogeny has not been\ncomprehensively studied to date. Here, phylogenetic analyses of\nPanorpidae were conducted for 155 extant species in eight genera based\non 182 morphological characters of adults under Maximum Parsimony and\nMaximum Likelihood, respectively, with two species of Choristidae and\nthree species of Panorpodidae as outgroups. The resultant phylogenetic\ntrees are basically consistent with those reconstructed in the molecular\nanalyses, and support the monophyly of two major clades and all the\nextant genera except Panorpa and Neopanorpa, which may need further\nsplitting. A new subfamily, Neopanorpinae subfam.n. is established to\ninclude Neopanorpa and Leptopanorpa, with all the other genera assigned\nto Panorpinae. We speculate that Panorpidae probably originated from\nEast Asia, and the independent dispersal events very likely occurred at\nleast twice for the Indonesian fauna, five times for the Japanese fauna,\ntwice for the western Palearctic fauna, and four times for the Nearctic\nfauna.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"160","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panorpidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134779.phy"}]}
