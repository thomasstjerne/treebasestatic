Twenty three new sequences, including 3\noutgroups are added in our new dataset. The Gangesiinae and the\nAcanthotaeniinae appear to be the most primitive clades. They are\nfollowed by a robust clade comprising the Palaearctic Proteocephalinae\nfrom freshwater fishes. The structure of the more derived clades,\ncomprising most Neotropical and Nearctic species, is less resolved. At\nthe nomenclatural level, we erect a new genus, Glanitaenia n.Â g., and\ndefine an aggregate for the Palaearctic Proteocephalus. After\nre-examination of all studied taxa, we identify two types of uterine\ndevelopment and show the importance of this character for the\nsystematics of the order. Our phylogeny does not support the classical\nview of a Neotropical origin of the Proteocephalidea but rather favours\nan Old World origin of the group either in saurians or Palaearctic\nSiluriformes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteocephalidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5844.phy"}]}
