Two highly supported clades were found: 1. C. paspali, C.\nzizaniae, C. grohii, C. sulcata, C. fusiformis and C. purpurea and 2. C.\ncitrina, C. phalaridis, two unidentified Claviceps spp. (isolates PM and\nSG), C. sorghicola, C. gigantea, C. sorghi, C. africana, C. viridis and\nC. pusilla. No relationship was found between the species placement and\nits morphological markers. The probe from C. purpurea gene cpd1 for\ndimethylallyl tryptophan synthase, the first enzyme of alkaloid\nbiosynthesis, was hybridized to PstI digested genomes of the above\nspecies under non-stringent conditions. Hybridizing DNA was present in\nall species of clade 1, although the signal of the C. paspali gene was\nweaker. In clade 2, only C. africana, C. gigantea, and C. pusilla gave\nweak positive signals. Colorimetric detection found small amounts of\nalkaloids in cultures of Claviceps sp. SG and PM but despite that, no\ncpd1 hybridizing bands were found. The occurrence of two major clades of\nClaviceps and their biogeography suggests, that the genus originates\nfrom South America and that the evolution of its species was influenced\nby comigration with their hosts and with the global climatic changes\nthat influenced spreading of grass subfamilies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3636.phy"}]}
