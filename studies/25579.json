This species\nexhibits several “chemotypes” differing in farina (flavonoid exudates)\ncolor and chemistry. By integrating data from molecular phylogenetics,\ncytology, biochemistry, and biogeography, we here circumscribe the major\nevolutionary lineages within N. standleyi and reconstruct their\ndiversification histories. Methods: Forty-eight samples were selected\nfrom across the geographic distribution of N. standleyi. Phylogenetic\nrelationships were inferred using four plastid and five nuclear markers.\nPloidy levels were inferred using spore sizes calibrated by chromosome\ncounts, and farina chemistry was compared using thin-layer\nchromatography. Results: Four clades are recognized, three roughly\ncorresponding to previously recognized chemotypes. The diploid clades G\nand Y are found in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, respectively;\nthey are estimated to have diverged in the Pleistocene, congruent with\nthe postulated timing of climatological events separating these two\ndeserts. Clade P/YG is tetraploid and partially overlaps the\ndistribution of clade Y in the eastern Chihuahuan Desert. It is\napparently confined to limestone, a geologic substrate rarely occupied\nby members of the other clades. The cryptic (C) clade, a diploid group\nknown only from southern Mexico and highly disjunct from the other three\nclades, is newly recognized here. Conclusions: We reveal a complex\nintraspecific diversification history of Notholaena standleyi, traceable\nto a variety of evolutionary drivers including classic allopatry,\nparapatry with or without changes in geologic substrate, and sympatric\ndivergence through polyploidization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121397.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121383.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121382.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121386.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121398.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121377","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121377.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121389.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121396.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121379.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121393.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121394.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121391.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121387.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121392.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121395.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121381.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121380.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121378.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121385.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121384.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121390.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121388","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121388.phy"}]}
