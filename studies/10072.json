We\nanalysed 91 Colletes species from the entire range of distribution and\n25 outgroup taxa. Eight different combinations of alignment parameters\nwere used for the 28S data, and our combined data set comprised between\n1801 and 1845 aligned nucleotides with COI contributing 339 informative\nbases and 28S between 318 and 360 informative sites. Our results\ncorroborate the monophyly of about half of the Old World subgenera and\nshow the need for a taxonomic re-delimitation of other groups currently\naccepted. The phylogenetic results confirm the South American origin of\nColletes and multiple faunal exchange events between North America and\nEurasia. The last continent colonized was Africa south of the Sahara,\nwhich experienced at least two independent invasions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"4680 3-1 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6171.phy"},{"tree_label":"4640 1-1 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6617.phy"},{"tree_label":"4662 2-1 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6232.phy"},{"tree_label":"4688 3-2 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6499.phy"},{"tree_label":"4747 5-5 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6134.phy"},{"tree_label":"4748 3-3 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6558.phy"},{"tree_label":"4676 2-2 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6401.phy"},{"tree_label":"4732 5-1 table 2","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Historical Biogeography of Colletes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6582.phy"}]}
