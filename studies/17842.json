In a\nrecent paper we described in detail H. subsection Denudata and fifteen\nEuropean species recognized within this subsection, using morphological\nand molecular methods. In this paper we continue this work and describe\nin detail three additional subsections and several new species. Within\nH. subsection Hiemalia, we recognise just one species, Hebeloma hiemale.\nHere we propose an epitype in order to unambiguously define this taxon.\nNine species occurring in Europe are assigned to H. subsect.\nClepsydroida, namely Hebeloma ammophilum, H. cavipes, H. fragilipes, H.\ningratum, H. laetitiae, H. limbatum sp. nov., H. matritensis sp. nov.,\nH. pseudofragilipes sp. nov. and H. vaccinum. Finally, we introduce H.\nsubsection Echinospora with three species: Hebeloma echinosporum sp.\nnov., H. populinum and H. rostratum sp. nov. We provide descriptions of\nall three of these species in order to clarify the taxonomy of this\nsection. We provide a key to H. sect. Denudata and the discussed\nsubsections. In the majority of the taxa there is good overall\nconsistency between morphological and phylogenetic delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 5 constrained","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88694","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig1A ITS","ntax":"350","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88695","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 best","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma sect.
