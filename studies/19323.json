We examined ambrosia beetles and plant hosts in the United\nStates and Taiwan for the presence of these mycosymbionts and found 22\nisolates representing known and undescribed lineages of Raffaelea. From\n28S rDNA and Î²T sequences, we generated a molecular phylogeny of the\nOphiostomatales and observed morphological features of seven cultures\nrepresenting undescribed lineages in Raffaelea s. str. From these\nanalyses, we describe five species in Raffaelea s. str.: R. aguacate sp.\nnov., R. campbellii sp. nov., R. crossotarsa sp. nov., R. cyclorhipidia\nsp. nov., and R. xyleborina sp. nov. Our analyses also identified two\nplant-pathogenic species of Raffaelea associated with previously\nundocumented beetle hosts: (1) R. quercivora, the causative agent of\nJapanese oak wilt, from Cyclorhipidion ohnoi and Crossotarsus\nemancipatus in Taiwan, and (2) R. lauricola, the pathogen of laurel\nwilt, from Ambrosiodmus lecontei in Florida. The results of this study\nshow that Raffaelea and associated ophiostomatoid fungi have been poorly\nsampled and that future investigations on ambrosia beetle mycosymbionts\nshould reveal a substantially increased diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP98","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Raffaelea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107772.phy"}]}
