The beta -tubulin gene intron 3 region and intron 4\nof the EF-1 alpha gene allowed clear differentiation of five species (C.\nafricana, C. sorghicola, C. purpurea, C. fusiformis, and C. paspali),\ntwo of which (C. africana and C. sorghicola) are pathogens of sorghum,\nwith almost no intraspecific variation observed among isolates.\nClaviceps isolates obtained from sorghum in the USA contained beta\n-tubulin gene intron 3 region sequences identical to those, of C.\nafricana isolates from India, Australia, and South Africa. PCR primers\nwere designed from unique sequences within the beta -tubulin intron 3\nregion that can differentiate the five Claviceps species used in this\nstudy. We describe primers that allow direct PCR detection of C.\nafricana from honeydew produced on infected sorghum plants, providing a\nuseful tool for analysis of field samples. The beta -tubulin gene intron\n3 region and EF-1 alpha intron 4 should prove useful in phylogenetic and\nepidemiological studies of additional Claviceps species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 5","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3646.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 6","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3647.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3648.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3649.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3650.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3645.phy"},{"tree_label":"bts PAUP 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3639.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3640.phy"},{"tree_label":"its PAUP 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3642.phy"},{"tree_label":"its PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3641.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3643.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef PAUP 7","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3644.phy"}]}
