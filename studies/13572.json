Are variable clades\nolder, giving more time for trait diversification? Or do they occupy\nparticular environments, providing a wider range of abiotic or biotic\nopportunities for the establishment and maintenance of diverse trait\nattributes? Does environmental opportunity increase trait variability\nacross all species, or is it specific to species belonging to the same\nclade, increasing only within-clade trait variability? We studied the\nvariability of six life-history traits (initiation of flowering,\nduration of flowering, plant life span, seed mass, stress tolerance,\ntype of reproduction) within 383 angiosperm genera from Central Europe\ndistributed along six abiotic gradients. We compared patterns of\nwithin-genus variability to those present in the entire dataset,\nindependent of genus membership. We found that trait variability\ndiffered strongly between genera, but did not depend on their age. Trait\nvariability was higher within genera occupying intermediate positions\nalong regional abiotic environmental gradients, compared with patterns\nacross the entire dataset (and unbiased by geographical sampling, family\nmembership or species richness). Increasing trait variability within\ngenera reflected increasing independence of traits from the abiotic\nenvironment. We conclude that intermediate abiotic environments play an\nimportant role in maintaining and possibly generating the striking\ndiversity of life history traits present within certain clades. They may\ndo so by relaxing the abiotic constraints on the evolution and\nmaintenance of species traits within clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Myriophyllum","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59861","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59861.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lemna","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59858.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pyrola","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59870.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ranunculaceae","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59847","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59847.phy"},{"tree_label":"Juncus","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poaceae","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59846","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59846.phy"},{"tree_label":"backbone","ntax":"214","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59862.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fabaceae","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59839.phy"},{"tree_label":"Najas","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59863.phy"},{"tree_label":"Gentianaceae","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59840.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cuscuta","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59854","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59854.phy"},{"tree_label":"Asteraceae","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ornithogalum","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59864.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lonicera","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59859.phy"},{"tree_label":"Boraginaceae","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Euphorbia","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59856","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59856.phy"},{"tree_label":"Orobanche","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59865","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Polygala","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Primula","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59869","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59869.phy"},{"tree_label":"Papaver","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59867.phy"},{"tree_label":"Oxalis","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ericaceae","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59838.phy"},{"tree_label":"Orchidaceae","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59844","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59844.phy"},{"tree_label":"Malvaceae","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59843","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59843.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rosaceae","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59848","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59848.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cyperaceae","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59836","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Liliaceae","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59842","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59842.phy"},{"tree_label":"Lamiaceae","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59841.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brassicaceae","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Caryophyllaceae","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59835","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59835.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dipsacaceae","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type
