The other families placed in the Geraniales in\nrecent higher order classifications fall into four well separated\nlineages, none of which apprears to be closely related to the\nGeraniaceae. Only Hypseocharis, often included in the Oxalidaceae,\nreceives strong support as a close relative to the monophyletic\nGeraniaceae sens. str., as suggested by Boesewinkel on the basis of seed\nanatomy. Sequence comparisons of rbcL provide the first highly resolved\nphylogeny of the Geraniaceae, indicating that Pelargonium is a sister\ngroup to the remainder of the family, that Erodium and Geranium are\nprobable sister genera, and that Monsonia and Sarcocaulon are either\nsister genera or are congeneric.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geraniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geraniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1305.phy"}]}
