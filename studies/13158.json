These species were isolated from decaying\nwood in the Tomakomai Experimental Forest in Hokkaido Prefecture and\nfrom bedlogs on shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) farms,\nrespectively. The species were characterized using a combined approach\nthat included cultural studies, holomorph morphology, and phylogenetic\nanalyses of internal transcribed spacer and protein coding gene\nsequences (RNA polymerase subunit II, translation elongation factor\n1-Î±, endochitinase, and actin). The results of phylogenetic analyses of\nthese gene sequences indicate that T. eijii belongs to the Hamatum clade\nand is closely related to Hypocrea pezizoides, H. flaviconidia, and H.\natroviridis/T. atroviride, from which it differs mainly in\npart-ascospore size and anamorphic characteristics. Trichoderma\npseudolacteum, which was previously recognized as H. lactea sensu Doi,\nis morphologically distinct from H. lactea (= Hypocrea citrina) and is\nstrongly supported as a separate lineage based on our phylogenetic\nanalyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con of 164","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60826.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma eijii ITS+RPB2+Chi18-5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60871.phy"},{"tree_label":"con of 27","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60795.phy"},{"tree_label":"con of 392","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60870.phy"},{"tree_label":"con of 6","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma pseudolacteum ITS+RPB2+TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60878.phy"},{"tree_label":"con of 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma Chi18-5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60830.phy"},{"tree_label":"con of 8","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60839.phy"}]}
