Each trophic type is\ncharacteristic of the suborders of Zoanthidea and is associated with\nsubstantial distributional asymmetries: suborder Macrocnemina are\nsymbionts of invertebrates and have global geographic and bathymetric\ndistributions and suborder Brachycnemina are hosts of endosymbiotic\nzooxanthellae and are restricted to tropical photic zones. While\nexposure to solar radiation could explain the bathymetric asymmetry it\ndoes not explain the geographic asymmetry, nor is it clear why\nevolutionary transitions to the zooxanthellae-free state have apparently\noccurred within Macrocnemina but not within Brachycnemina. To better\nunderstand the transitions between symbiosis-based trophic types of\nZoanthidea, a concatenated data set of nuclear and mitochondrial\nnucleotide sequences were used to test hypotheses of monophyly for\ngroups defined by morphology and symbiosis, and to reconstruct the\nevolutionary transitions of morphological and symbiotic characters. The\nresults indicate that the morphological characters that define\nMacrocnemina are plesiomorphic and the characters that define its\nsubordinate taxa are homoplasious. Symbioses with invertebrates have\nancient and recent transitions with a general pattern of stability in\nhost associations through evolutionary time. The reduction in\ndistribution of Zoanthidea is independent of the evolution of\nzooxanthellae symbiosis and consistent with hypotheses of the benefits\nof invertebrate symbioses, indicating that the ability to persist in\nmost habitats may have been lost with the termination of symbioses with\ninvertebrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trA","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9086.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trB","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis B","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9087.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trC","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis C","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9088.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trH","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis H","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9093.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trI","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis I","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9094.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear only","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9096.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trD","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis D","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9089.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trJ","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis J","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9095.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mito only","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9097.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trE","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis E","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9090.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trF","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9091.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat mito nuc trG","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoanthidea, Hypothesis G","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9092.phy"}]}
