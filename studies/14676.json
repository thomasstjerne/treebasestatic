Three isolates and ten sporocarps sampled in Japan were\nanalyzed phylogenetically using 18S rRNA gene sequences. The results\nindicated that S. pubescens is a member of Mucoromycotina. It formed an\nindependent clade separated from the other known orders of this\nsubphylum and it is closely related to the uncultured and unidentified\nMucoromycotinan fungi recently reported as environmental DNAs in\nliverworts and hornworts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucoromycotina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66569.phy"}]}
