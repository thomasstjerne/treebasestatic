Propagation of these woody plants using vegetative\ncuttings is, however, hampered by fungal infections initiated in the\nnursery. Recently black foot rot disease symptoms were observed on\nvegetative cuttings of Protea and Leucospermum in a fynbos nursery near\nStanford, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Isolations from\nsymptomatic plant material revealed several isolates of Ilyonectria,\nwhich were identified as I. macrodidyma, I. torresensis and four novel\ntaxa described here as I. capensis, I. leucospermi, I. protearum and I.\nvredehoekensis. Species were characterised based on DNA phylogenetic\ninference and morphological comparisons. Furthermore, Kochâs postulates\nwere conducted, which confirmed all six Ilyonectria species capable of\ncausing black foot rot of Proteaceae. Other than the novel plant\npathogenic species described here, this study also represents the first\nreport of black foot rot disease associated with the cultivation of\nProteaceae cut flowers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"combined","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilyonectria black foot rot BTUB HIS ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58998.phy"}]}
