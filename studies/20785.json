Lagerheima sphaerospora (≡ Bulgariella\nsphaerospora, type species of the genus Lagerheima) is confirmed to be\nconspecific with B. pulla, type species of Bulgariella. The genus\nBulgariella, the older name, includes a single species B. pulla. Asci\nlack a pore and open by splitting to form valves. This is an unusual\nfeature in the Leotiomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences\nfrom Tef1-α, RPB2, and the 18S and 28S rRNA genes determined that\nBulgariella belongs within the Leotiomycetes without satisfactory\nplacement. A comparison of the ITS-5.8s rDNA region among the five\nisolates of Bulgariella examined determined that the Bulgariella\nisolates from the USA, Norway and Sweden had 100 % sequence similarity,\nwhile the isolate from Chile had 99.3% similarity to these\nisolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bulgariella SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, EF, RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102973.phy"}]}
