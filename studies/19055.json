We studied the species diversity\nof Botryosphaeriaceae associated with marula (Sclerocarya birrea subsp.\ncaffra, Anacardiaceae) trees in South Africa over two seasons, as well\nas species common to both S. birrea and adjacent mango (Mangifera\nindica, Anacardiaceae) in a subset of sites. Gene flow amongst\npopulations of Botryosphaeriaceae shared on these tree species were\ntested using microsatellite markers. Twelve species were identified from\nS. birrea and eleven species were found on M. indica trees. From\nisolations done in 2006, the dominant species on S. birrea was\nNeofusicoccum vitifusiforme, while N. parvum was the dominant species\nisolated from M. indica. Neofusicoccum parvum was dominant in isolations\nfrom both hosts in 2012. Isolates of Botryosphaeria fabicerciana, L.\nmahajangana, L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae, N. mediterraneum and N.\numdonicola were also isolated from both hosts. Population genetic\nanalyses on isolates of N. parvum suggested that three populations were\npresent, each comprising isolates from both hosts. There is significant\ngene flow between N. parvum populations on these hosts. This ability to\ninfect multiple hosts and migrate amongst them enables the establishment\nand spread of species and genotypes of the Botryosphaeriaceae, such as\nN. parvum, in new areas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS MP tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS MP tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94998.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex BT ML tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex BT ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94997.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF ML tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TEF ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94900.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS_TEF_BT MP tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS_TEF_BT MP tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95002.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS_TEF_BT ML tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS_TEF_BT ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex TEF ML tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex TEF ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95001.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex TEF MP tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex TEF MP tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95000.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF MP tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TEF MP tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94901.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS ML tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex ITS ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94999.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parvum-ribis complex BT MP tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parvum-ribis complex BT MP tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94996.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106907.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106908.phy"}]}
