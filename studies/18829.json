The species has not been collected from its\ntype locality on the Pacific coast of Japan since 1927, and seems to\nhave become extinct from the vicinity. To molecularly characterize L.\njaponica, we extracted DNA from topotype material of L. japonica\ncollected in 1927, analyzed nine genes using Illumina next-generation\nsequencing, and compared these data with sequences from modern samples\nof similar red algae collected from the Japan Sea coast of Japan. Both\nmorphological and molecular data from modern samples and historical\nspecimens (including the lectotype and topotype) suggest that the\nspecimens from the Pacific and Japan Sea coasts of Japan should be\ntreated as a single species, and that L. japonica is phylogenetically\nseparated from the genus Liagora. Based on the phylogenetic results and\nan examination of reproductive structures, we propose Otohimella\njaponica gen. et comb. nov., characterized morphologically by diffuse\ncarposporophytes, undivided carposporangia, and the involucral filaments\ninitiated only from the subcortical cell on the supporting cell.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93606.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liagora japonica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93604.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93605.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93607.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93610.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93608.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93611.phy"}]}
