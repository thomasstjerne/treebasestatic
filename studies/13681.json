However, the effects of rhizobia on plant volatiles, which\nserve as indirect and direct defenses against arthropod herbivores and\nas signals in defense-associated plant-plant and within-plant signaling,\nare still unstudied. We measured the release of jasmonic acid\n(JA)-induced volatiles of rhizobia-colonized and rhizobia-free lima bean\nplants (Fabaceae: Phaseolus lunatus L.) and tested effects of their\nrespective bouquets of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a specialist\ninsect herbivore (Mexican bean beetle; Coccinellidae: Epilachana\nvarivestis Mulsant) in olfactometer choice trials. In a further\nexperiment, we showed that VOC induction by JA reflects the plant\nresponses to mechanical wounding and insect herbivory. Following\ninduction with JA, rhizobia-colonized plants released significantly\nhigher amounts of the shikimic acid derived compounds, whereas the\nemission of compounds produced via the octadecanoid, mevalonate and\nnon-mevalonate pathways was reduced. These changes affected the choice\nbehavior of beetles as the preference of non-induced plants was much\nmore pronounced for plants that were colonized by rhizobia. We showed\nthat indole likely represents the causing agent for the observed\nrepellent effects of jasmonic-acid induced VOCs of rhizobia-colonized\nlima bean plants. Our study demonstrates a rhizobia-triggered efficacy\nof induced plant defense via volatiles. Due to these findings, we\ninterpret rhizobia as integral part of legume defenses against\nherbivores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootrep22","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59157.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep1000","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59165.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59136","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59136.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59137","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59137.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59138.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59139","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59139.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59140","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59140.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59141","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59141.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep7","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59142","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59142.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep8","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59143","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59143.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep9","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59144.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep10","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59145.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep11","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59146.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep12","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59147.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep13","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59148","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59148.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep14","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59149.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep15","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59150.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep16","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59151.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep17","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59152.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep18","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59153.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep19","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59154.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep20","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59155.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep21","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59156.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep23","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59158.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep24","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59159","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59159.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep25","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59160","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59160.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep26","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59161.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep27","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59162.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep28","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59163.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep29","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59164.phy"}]}
