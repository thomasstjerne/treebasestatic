This is eight additional cervical vertebrae when compared\nwith the ancestral condition seen in basal ornithischians such as\nScutellosaurus. Miragaia has a higher cervical count than most of the\niconically long-necked sauropod dinosaurs. Long neck length has been\nachieved by ‘cervicalization’ of anterior dorsal vertebrae and probable\nlengthening of centra. All these anatomical features are evolutionarily\nconvergent with those exhibited in the necks of sauropod dinosaurs.\nMiragaia longicollum is based upon a partial articulated skeleton, and\nincludes the only known cranial remains from any European stegosaur. A\nwell-resolved phylogeny supports a new clade that unites Miragaia and\nDacentrurus as the sister group to Stegosaurus; this new topology\nchallenges the common view of Dacentrurus as a basal stegosaur.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thyreophora phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55926.phy"}]}
