The Japanese Kitamagotake specimens were\nmorphologically distinguished from Southeast Asian A. javanica sensu\nstricto. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregion of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene showed that Kitamagotake specimens\nformed an independent clade that was distant from that of A. javanica.\nTherefore, we described here Kitamagotake as a new species, Amanita\nkitamagotake sp. nov. Interestingly, Japanese yellow-cap Caesars\nmushrooms contained yellow-color variant specimens of A. caesareoides\n(normally red-cap) and A. aff. similis (normally olive-brown-cap), both\nof which could lead misidentification as A. kitamagotake. Especially,\noriginal specimen of Japanese A. javanica did not correspond\nmorphologically to A. kitamagotake but was decided as the yellow-color\nvariant of A. aff. similis. These results strongly suggest the\nimportance of precise morphological observation and molecular analysis\nfor the precise identification of yellow-cap Caesars mushroom\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita kitamagotake","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96678.phy"}]}
