It is\nglobally distributed in tropical, subtropical and temperate areas, and\npresently six species were accepted. In this paper, Protubera\nbeijingensis from northern China was described as a new species. Its\nmorphological description and illustration were provided in details and\ncompared with morphological similar species. A multi-gene phylogenetic\nanalysis based on nLSU, atp6 and rpb2 sequences of the genus Protubera\nalso supported the establishment of this new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108735.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111738","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111738.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111739","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111739.phy"}]}
