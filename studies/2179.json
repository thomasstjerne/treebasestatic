The analysis was based on 113\ndiscrete and six continuous morphological characters. In the resulting\ntopologies the genus Digitaria was monophyletic. In spite of the low\nsupport for most groupings, several clades were recovered. The\nsubdivision of Digitaria in the four subgenera proposed by Henrard was\nnot supported since the large subgenus Digitaria appears as a\nparaphyletic assemblage within which the other three subgenera are\nnested. Nevertheless, the monophyly of some of Henrard’s sections was\nsupported. This is the first approach to the phylogeny of Digitaria.\nKeywords\u001aCladistic, Digitaria, Paniceae, phylogeny, Poaceae,\nsystematics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Digitaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5359.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Digitaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5360.phy"}]}
