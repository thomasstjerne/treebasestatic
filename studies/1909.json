A species of\nPlasmopara parasitic on Scorzonera, invalidly published several times,\nis assigned to a new genus and species under Novotelnova scorzonerae.\nPlasmopara euphrasiae sp. nov. is segregated from Pl. densa and Pl.\ncentaureae-mollis is revised and relegated to synonymy of Bremia\ncentaureae. All taxa are described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4960.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPMajRule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4961.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPStrict","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4962.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCMC","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4963.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4964.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyML","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4965.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCMC","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4966.phy"}]}
