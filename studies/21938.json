Based on this,\nthis study aimed to isolate and characterize Muscodor strains from the\nmedicinal plant Schinus terebinthifolius and verify its action against\nPenicillium digitatum, the causal agent of green mold in citrus. Two\nstrains, LGMF1255 and LGMF1256, were isolated and using morphological\ndata and phylogenetic analysis of ITS DNA region, were characterized as\nbelonging to Muscodor genus. The strain Muscodor sp. LGMF1255 presented\n100% of ITS identity with M. sutura, M. vitigenus and M. equiseti. The\nphylogenetic analysis suggests strain LGMF1256 as a new species, for\nwhich we proposed the name of Muscodor brasiliensis. The VOCs produced\nby both strains were identified and measured using SPME-GC-MS. Their\nbiological activities against P. digitatum were screened using different\nnutritional sources. Both strains were able to inhibit P. digitatum\ngrowth, but the results with M. brasiliensis were significantly higher,\nand this strain was selected for enlarge the activity against P.\ndigitatum in fruit. The lesions of green mold were 67% smaller in\ndetached oranges when M. brasiliensis was present in comparison with the\ncontrol. The main VOCs produced exclusively by M. brasiliensis are\nphenylethyl alcohol, α-curcumene and E (β) farnesene, compounds\npreviously associated with antimicrobial properties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscodor brasiliensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109016.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscodor brasiliensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109015.phy"}]}
