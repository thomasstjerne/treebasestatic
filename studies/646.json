The sequences were phylogenetically analyzed using\nparsimony jackknifing. Xanthoria parietina and X. sorediata were chosen\nas outgroups. Because of the variable nature of the ITS regions\nparsimony jackknifing analyses were performed on different alignments.\nThe analyses resulted in trees with several shared, well-supported\ngroups. A consensus tree, summarizing all the trees from different\nalignments was also calculated. In that tree the family Physciaceae\nformed a monophyletic group. Some of the crustose species of Physciaceae\n(in the genera Amandinea, Buellia and Dimelaena) appeared as two sister\ngroups to the rest of the family. In this latter group Physcia,\nHeterodermia speciosa and Mobergia calculiformis constituted the sister\ngroup to the remaining family, which included the genera Anaptychia,\nHyperphyscia, Phaeorrhiza, Phaeophyscia, Physconia and Rinodina. The\ngenus Phaeophyscia was found to be monophyletic with 100 % support.\nAnaptychia and Physconia, together with Phaeorrhiza nimbosa and Rinodina\nturfacea formed its sister group. Hyperphyscia adglutinata was found in\na trichotomy with the other two groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physciaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3602.phy"}]}
