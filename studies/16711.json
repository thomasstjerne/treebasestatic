Fungi of this genus were reported as abundant\nin the endophytic fungi community of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris\nL.). The goals of the present study were to identify, to analyze the\nphylogenetic relations and to evaluate the genetic variability of\nDiaporthe endophytic isolates. Diaporthe sp., D. infecunda, D. melonis\nand D. phaseolorum were identified using multi-locus phylogeny (rDNA ITS\nregion; EF1-Î±, Î²-tubulin, and calmodulin gene sequences). IRAP\n(Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism) and REMAP\n(Retrotransposon-Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism) molecular\nmarkers reveal the existence of high genetic variability, especially\namong D. infecunda isolates. It were concluded that the multi-locus\nphylogenetic approach was more effective than individual analyses of ITS\nsequences, in identify the fungus to species level, and that IRAP and\nREMAP markers can be used for studying the genetic variability of the\nDiaporthe fungal genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80051","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_80051.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80049","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_80049.phy"}]}
