Comprehensive description, photographs, and comparisons\nwith phenetically similar species are provided. The nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer region (ITS), nuclear ribosomal large\nsubunit (nLSU) and the nuclear second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase\nII (rpb2) gene of the new species were sequenced and deposited in\nGenBank. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of rpb2 gene\nregion supported the generic placement and species validity of the new\nspecies. This forms the first record of the genus Rhodophana from\nIndia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodophana squamulosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97439.phy"}]}
