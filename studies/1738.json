The\ncarbonaceous tissue forms palisades on and beneath perithecial layer as\nwell as encasing individual perithecia, whereas the fibrous tissue fills\nthe spaces between stakes of the palisades as well as between encased\nperithecia. Phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences of beta-tubulin\nand alpha-actin genes placed Theissenia among the genera with bipartite\nstromata in the subfamily Hypoxyloideae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Suppl. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, TUB MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_510.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, TUB ACT MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, TUB ACT MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_978.phy"},{"tree_label":"Suppl. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, TUB MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_979.phy"},{"tree_label":"Suppl. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, ACT MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Suppl. 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theissenia, ACT MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_981.phy"}]}
