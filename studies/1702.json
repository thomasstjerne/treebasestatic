From leaf material collected\nin China, Vietnam and Indonesia, we describe three new Mycosphaerella\nspp.; M. vietnamiensis, M. obscuris and M. yunnanensis. Mycosphaerella\ncrystallina, previously known only from South Africa, and M.\nstramenticola, previously reported from Eucalyptus leaf litter in\nBrazil, are new records. Mycosphaerella citri, an important pathogen of\ncitrus, was found infecting Eucalyptus. Mycosphaerella marksii and M.\nsuttoniae, which have been previously reported in Asia, were regularly\nencountered. Pseudocercospora spp. were also common throughout the\nregion. This study highlights the potential biodiversity of\nMycosphaerella spp. on eucalypts in South-East Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella spp. on Eucalyptus, Flexuosa Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2644.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella spp. on Eucalyptus, Citri Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2645.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella spp. on Eucalyptus, Pseudocercospora\nClade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2646.phy"}]}
