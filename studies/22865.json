Two new genera, eight new species and four\nnew combinations from east Asia are described or proposed based on\nmorphology and phylogenetic analyses of ITS and nrLSU sequence data. Of\nthem, Exidiella gen. nov. is erected for E. bambusicola (generic type)\nand E. taiwanensis spp. nov. The genus differs from Exidia by its\nresupinate basidiocarps and ellipsoid basidiospores, and formed a\nlineage distant from Exidia glandulosa (generic type) in the\nphylogenetic tree. Heterocorticium gen. nov. is established for H.\nbambusicola (generic type) and H. latisporum spp. nov. The genus is\nsimilar to Exidiopsis in microscope, but differs by having pigmented\ncoriaceous basidiocarps and forming a distinct lineage in the\nphylogenetic tree. Eichleriella alpina, E. bambusicola, Heteroradulum\nmaolanensis and H. tropicum are described and illustrated as new.\nEichleriella delicata, E. roseola, E. sinensis and Heteroradulum\nmussooriensis were combined from Heterochaete. Heteroradulum semis is\ntreated as a heterotypic synonym of H. mussooriensis. Authentic\nspecimens of Eichleriella chinensis were examined and determined to be\nStereum peculiar.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112176","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112176.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112177.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112178.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112179","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112179.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112180.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112181.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112182.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112183.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112184.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112185","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112185.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112186","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112186.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112187","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112187.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112188","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112188.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112189.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112191.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112192.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112193","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112193.phy"}]}
