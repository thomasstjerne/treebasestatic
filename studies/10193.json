Lepiota neophana, a species with an annulus and a closed brown\npileus surface, and L. lilacea, with a conspicuous dark annulus, are\nboth recorded for the first time west of the Rocky Mountains. The\nidentity of L. neophana is reviewed and clarified. based on\nmorphological and molecular data. The type collection of L. rufipes was\nstudied and L. rufipes is put in the synonymy with Cystolepiota\nseminuda. A key to the species is given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepiota neophana, ef1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6540.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepiota, nrITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6602.phy"}]}
