DNA sequencing of cultures derived\nfrom collections clearly showed that these collections were neither\nLentinus nor Phyllotopsis and were not related to other pleurotoid\ngenera Hohenbuehelia and Pleurotus. A new genus is described and\ncharacterized by culture morphology and growth, fruitbody morphology,\nand ITS and LSU sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russomyces LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93516.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russomyces ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93515.phy"}]}
