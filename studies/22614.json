The phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data from\nnrITS sequences shown that two species are different from other\nMarasmius species of the ser. Spinulosi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111482.phy"}]}
