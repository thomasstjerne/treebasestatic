Currently, the leaf spot is\nconsidered the major pest problems in palm trees, mainly affecting their\nmarketing. The objective of this study was to conduct a molecular and\nmorphological characterization of pestalotioid fungi associated with\nleaf spot disease of Caryota mitis, Cocos nucifera, Dypsis lutescens, D.\nmadagascariensis, Euterpe edulis, Licuala grandis, Phoenix roebelenii,\nPtychosperma elegans, and Wodyetia bifurcata. Seedlings showing symptoms\nwere collected in nurseries in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The\nfungal isolates were identified molecularly using the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), partial β-tubulin (TUB) and partial\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF), along with morphological\ncharacterization and pathogenicity. Seven isolates obtained from\ndiseased tissue were identified as new species belonging to the genus\nNeopestalotiopsis, described in the work as N. arecacearum and N.\nphoenicis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first worldwide\nreport of the N. foedans and N. surinamensis causing leaf spot in palm\ntrees and the first report of the occurrence of these species in\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132963.phy"}]}
