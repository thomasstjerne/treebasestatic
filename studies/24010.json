This paper provides a revised description of Paragnomonia and P.\nfra- gariae with lecto- and epitypification based on the species\noriginal description, recent collections from four European countries,\nexamination of specimens used in the previous taxonomic studies and\nphylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of LSU, ITS/5.8S and tef1-a. This\nstudy presents the first report of P. fragariae on cultivated strawberry\nin Finland and Lithuania. Our study on growth rate showed that P.\nfragariae is a cold-adapted fungus growing almost equally at 5 \u0014C as at\n20 \u0014C and attaining maximal growth at 15 \u0014C. New primers were designed for\namplification of ca. 0.8 kb fragment of tef1-a of Sydo- wiella\nfenestrans. Additionally, newly generated sequences of tef1-a were\nobtained for the first time from 21 isolates of seven species belonging\nto five genera of Sydowiellaceae, including the type species S.\nfenestrans, therefore considerably contributing to the current knowledge\non phylogenetic relationships of this insufficiently studied group of\nfungi. The phylogenetic analysis has also revealed that the recently\ndescribed species “S.” centaureii is genetically distant from the\ngeneric type S. fenestrans and other Sydowiella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116048","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative
