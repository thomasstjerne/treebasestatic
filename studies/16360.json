Although genome-wide analysis of this gene family has\nbeen carried out in some species, the R2R3 MYB genes in Beta vulgaris\nssp. vulgaris (sugar beet) as the first sequenced member of the order\nCaryophyllales, have not been analysed heretofore.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Additional file 2","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Beta vulgaris Maximum Parsimony","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77471.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"253","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Beta vulgaris Neighbor Joining","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77470.phy"}]}
