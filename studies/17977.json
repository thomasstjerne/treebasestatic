The species is characterized by white to pink, resupinate,\neffused-reflexed to pileate basidiomata, round to angular pores (4â“6\nper mm), and ellipsoid to subcylindrical basidiospores (3â“4 Ã 1.8â“2.0\nÎ¼m). Phylogenetic analyses based on combined nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2\n(ITS) and partial nuc 28S rDNA D1-D2 domains (28S) sequences show that\nthe new species, as well as Antrodia wangii and Piptoporus betulinus\n(Bull.) P. Karst., belong in the Fomitopsis sensu stricto group within\nthe Antrodia clade, and the combination Fomitopsis betulina comb. nov.\nis proposed. Description and illustration of the new species, and a key\nto the species of Fomitopsis reported to Neotropics are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitopsis sensu stricto using ITS/28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89197.phy"}]}
