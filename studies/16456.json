Sequences of multiple gene regions were\nused to identify these fungi and their pathogenicity was tested on N.\npumilio and N. dombeyi. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a novel taxon\ndescribed here as C. decorticans sp. nov., most closely related to\nspecies in the C. moniliformis complex. Inoculations on N. dombeyi and\nN. pumilio in the forest showed that C. decorticans is able to produce\nlocalized lesions on healthy Nothofagus trees","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Ceratocystis decorticates ML bootstrap ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78266.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEFa","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"TEFalpha Ceratocystis decorticans ML bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78268.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S MLT","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratocystis decorticans ML bootstrap","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78265.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"BT Ceratocystis decorticans ML bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78267.phy"}]}
