It\noriginated once, about 10,000 years ago. Phylogenetic analyses of\nmitochondrial sequences from dogs, wolves, and a geographically diverse\ncollection of CTVT samples indicate that the cancer has periodically\nacquired mitochondria from its host. We suggest that this may be because\nthe cancerÂ’s own mitochondria have a tendency to degenerate, due to high\nmutation rates and relaxed selection, resulting in host mitochondria\nbeing more fit.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Canine transmissible venereal tumor mitochondria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53560.phy"}]}
