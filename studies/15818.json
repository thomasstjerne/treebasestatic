Our 28S rRNA gene D1/D2 (28S) and internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) regions ITS sequence-based phylogenies indicated that the\n20 isolates, which displayed no genetic divergence, firmly clustered\nwith the authentic strain B. anomala CBS 130.38 (GoidÃ nichiâs isolate).\nThese isolates and B. anomala CBS 130.38 grouped together with species\nof the teleomorphic genus Sistotrema and its allies in the Cantharelloid\nclade were defined by Moncalvo et al. in 2006. The biodeteriorated\nmurals, plaster, and stone walls as the substrates or habitats, on which\nthis fungus colonized, are noteworthy. Additionally, this is the first\nrecord of B. anomala isolated in Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"aff.
