It contains two\ndistinct species, one with primarily laminal soralia and another\ndistinguished by its characteristic marginal soralia. The latter taxon\nis here described as the new species H. confusa. Hyperphyscia\nadglutinata and H. confusa have broadly overlapping distributions in\nNorth America, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains states. Where\nthe two are sympatric, H. confusa is generally the more common of the\ntwo. Descriptions and discussions for H. adglutinata and the two other\nsorediate North American species, H. minor and H. pyrithrocardia, are\nalso included, along with a key for separation of the four species.\nHyperphyscia pyrithrocardia is reported for the first time from North\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyperphyscia conusa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71738.phy"}]}
