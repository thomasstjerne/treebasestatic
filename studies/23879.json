In the past decade, molecular\nphylogenetic studies have contributed substantially for an improved\ncircumscription of clades at all taxonomic levels, especially at the\ngeneric and tribal levels. For instance, a molecular phylogeny of Tribe\nBignonieae reconstructed a polyphyletic Arrabidaea DC., and proposed a\nnew circumscription for members of the “Arrabidaea & Allies” clade.\nWithin this new classification, most species previously included in\nArrabidaea were distributed among four genera: Cuspidaria DC. (19 spp.),\nFridericia Mart. emend. L.G. Lohmann (67 spp.), Tanaecium Sw. emend.\nL.G. Lohmann (17 spp.), and Xylophragma Sprague (7 spp.). The taxonomy\nof Fridericia, the genus that received most species of Arrabidaea,\nremains complicated due to the high morphological variability and broad\ndistribution of its species. Here, we used molecular data and a broad\nsampling of taxa within the “Arrabidaea & Allies” clade to\nreconstruct the phylogeny of Fridericia. We then studied the morphology\nof all species of Fridericia and identified morphological synapomorphies\nthat characterize major clades that represent meaningful units for\nfuture taxonomic studies. Most genera included in the “Arrabidaea &\nAllies” clade were retrieved as monophyletic; however, two species of\nFridericia were reconstructed within Cuspidaria, while three species of\nFridericia were placed within Tanaecium. The molecular phylogenetic\nplacements received additional support from morphology, and the\nnecessary taxonomic changes are here proposed. We combined three species\nof Fridericia in Tanaecium (i.e., T. dichotomum (Jacq.) Kaehler, &\nL.G. Lohmann, T. paradoxum (Sandwith) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann, and T.\nparviflorum (Mart. ex DC.) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann), two species in\nXylophragma (i.e., X. claussenii (A. DC.) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann,\nand X. corchoroides (Cham.) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann), two species in\nCuspidaria (i.e., C. bracteolata (DC.) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann, and\nC. monophylla (A.H. Gentry) Kaehler & L.G. Lohmann), and one species\nof Adenocalymma in Fridericia (i.e., F. trichoclada (DC.) Kaehler &\nL.G. Lohmann). We also synonymize Fridericia whitei (Rusby) L.G. Lohmann\ninto Cuspidaria pulchra (Cham.) L.G. Lohmann. We present a key for the\nseven main clades identified within the genus, as well as a detailed\nmorphological description for Fridericia and its major lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"combined_ML","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115607.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115612.phy"},{"tree_label":"PepC","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115613.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115608.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115609.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115610.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115611.phy"}]}
