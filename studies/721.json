From this, we reconstruct\nthe evolution of the complex electric organs of these fishes.\nPhylogenetic results are generally concordant with earlier preliminary\nmolecular studies of a smaller group of species and with the\nosteology-based classification of Taverne, which divides the group into\nthe Gymnarchidae and the Mormyridae, with the latter including the\nsubfamilies Petrocephalinae (Petrocephalus) and Mormyrinae (all\nremaining taxa). However, we find that several genera previously\nrecognized by Taverne are non- monophyletic. Within the Mormyrinae, the\ngenus Myomyrus is the sister group to all the remaining taxa. Other\nwell-supported clades within this group are recovered. A reconstruction\nof electrocyte evolution on the basis of our best-supported topology\nsuggests that electrocytes with penetrating stalks evolved once early in\nthe history of the mormyrids followed by multiple paedomorphic reversals\nto electrocytes with non-penetrating stalks.
