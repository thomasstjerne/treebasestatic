Phylogenetic\nanalyses and morphological studies show that R. paumanokensis is a later\nsynonym of R. copelandii and that R. licentii is a distinct taxon. Based\non morphologic and molecular data, the new genus Noblesia (Meruliaceae,\nPolyporales) is proposed to accommodate Sistotrema croceum and\nPeniophora femsjoeensis. For many years, Sarcodontia crocea was based on\nan erroneous concept of Sistotrema croceum. The correct name for the\ntaxon with striking yellow spines found on Malus and Pyrus in Europe is\nSarcodontia setosa; its North American sister species is S. amplissima.\nHydnum sulphureum is a synonym of Sarcodontia uda. Species excluded from\nSarcodontia are discussed, and the new combination Hyalodon sibirica is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131467","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131467.phy"}]}
