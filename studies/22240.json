Haploid, cytoplasmic\ngenomes like the plastid genome can be used to overcome the problem of\nhomeologous genes and recombination in polyploid taxa. Fragaria\n(Rosaceae) contains several octo- and decaploid species. We use plastome\nsequences to infer the plastid ancestry of these taxa with special focus\non the decaploid Fragaria cascadensis. METHODS We used genome skimming\nof 96 polyploid Fragaria samples on a single Illumina HiSeq 3000 lane to\nobtain whole plastome sequences. These sequences were used for\nphylogenetic reconstructions and dating analyses. Ploidy of all samples\nwas inferred with flow cytometry and plastid inheritance was examined in\na controlled cross of F. cascadensis. KEY RESULTS The plastid genome\nphylogeny shows that only the octoploid F. chiloensis is monophyletic,\nall other polyploid taxa were supported to be para- or polyphyletic. The\ndecaploid Fragaria cascadensis has biparental plastid inheritance and\nfour different plastid donors. Diversification of the F. cascadensis\nclades occurred in the last 230,000 years. The southern part of its\ndistribution range harbors considerably higher genetic diversity,\nsuggestive of a potential refugium. CONCLUSIONS Fragaria cascadensis\noriginated at least four times from parents with different plastomes. In\ncontrast, para- and polyphyletic taxa of the octoploid Fragaria species\nare best explained by incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization.\nBiogeographic patterns in F. cascadensis are probably a result of range\nshift during the last glacial maximum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"clade 2+MRD","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 2+MRD constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109893.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 6+MRD","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 6+MRD constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109897.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 6+F. iinumae","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 6+F. iinumae constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109896.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 4+MRD","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 4+MRD constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109895.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 1+MRD","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 1+MRD constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109891.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 2+F. iinumae","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 2+F. iinumae constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109892.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 1+F. iinumae","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 1+F. iinumae constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109890.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 1+2+4+6","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 1+2+4+6 constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 bootstraps","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109888.phy"},{"tree_label":"clade 4+F. iinumae","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade 4+F. iinumae constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109894.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BEAST tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix S2","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"full plastid dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109886.phy"}]}
