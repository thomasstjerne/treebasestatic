However, it remains unclear whether origination of\nmycorrhizal symbiosis could promote adaptive diversification of fungi.\nBased on the phylogenic tree inferred from the nucleotide sequences of\n87 single-copy genes, we reconstructed the origins of ectomycorrhizal\n(ECM) symbiosis in a species-rich basidiomycetous order, Boletales. The\nhigh-resolution phylogeny of Boletales indicated at least four\nindependent, asynchronous origins of ECM symbiosis. Among the four\norigins, only the third earliest event, occurring in the clade of\nBoletaceae, was suggested to result in a large-scale adaptive radiation\nevent, which was possibly fueled by the timely evolution of angiosperm\nhosts (ECM rosids) and subsequent expansion to broad geographic ranges\nwith the novel host lineages. These results suggest that true pioneers\nare not always successful and that high diversification potentials can\nbe made available for “timely innovators”, which initiated mutualistic\nsymbiosis with contemporaneously-evolving hosts that offered large niche\nspaces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109400.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109401.phy"}]}
