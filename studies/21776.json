These isolates were\nclassified into four morphotypes according to morphological characters,\ni.e., shape of monilioid cells and branch type of monilioid cell chains,\nwhile they were separated into five clades by molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis based on the rDNA 5.8S and D1/D2 regions. The four morphotypes\nand the five clades were correlated. In addition, these five genetically\ndifferent groups were distinguishable in their physiological characters.\nThus, Epulorhiza repens (including two genetic subgroups in E. repens)\nand three new species, Epulorhiza dendritica sp. nov., Epulorhiza\nellipsoidea sp. nov., and Epulorhiza cumulopuntioides sp. nov., were\nrecognized in this study. This study built a new definition of the type\nof monilioid cell chain as a taxonomical character. In addition, this\nstudy showed species diversity of orchid mycorrhizal fungi in the genus\nEpulorhiza of S. sinensis var. amoena f. amoena, which was believed to\nconsist of only one species, E. repens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107763","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107763.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107764.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107762","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107762.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107766","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107766.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 2+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107765.phy"}]}
