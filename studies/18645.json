While the\ncosmopolitan genus Usnea is well known, and easily recognized by the\nyellowish beard-like thallus with central cord, delimitation of many\nUsnea species is difficult due to the high variation and complexity of\ndiagnostic characters. In this study we assessed the monophyly of 18\nspecies from section Usnea occurring in North America and Europe,\nincluding sorediate and sexually reproducing taxa with both pendent and\nshrubby thalli. Six nuclear markers (ribosomal ITS and IGS, and\nprotein-coding beta-tubulin, MCM7, RPB1 and RPB2) were sequenced for 144\nsamples. All analyzed loci show weak genetic structure and short branch\nlengths in single-locus topologies, suggesting recent diversification of\nthe sampled taxa. Concatenated, multi-locus analyses conducted in\nBayesian and maximum likelihood frameworks, as well as coalescent-based\nspecies delimitation and species tree methods, recover several distinct\nclades, some represent traditional morphology-based species (Usnea\ncavernosa, U. praetervisa, U. silesiaca, U. wasmuthii), while others\nform clusters of two or more species (Usnea florida  U. subfloridana, U.\nfulvoreagens  U. glabrescens, U. barbata  U. chaetophora  U. dasopoga \nU. diplotypus, U. barbata  U. intermedia  U. lapponica  U. substerilis).\nWe propose synonymization of U. substerilis under U. lapponica. The\nstatus of several other species within intermixed clusters requires\nfurther evaluation with more extensive sampling and the inclusion of\nmore variable markers before taxonomic consequences can be considered. A\nnew species, Usnea parafloridana is described from Wisconsin, USA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92831.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxMLconcat","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92833.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxMLITS","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92917.phy"}]}
