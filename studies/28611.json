Thus, applying genetic and omics\napproaches to study these fungi remains a major challenge, particularly\nfor species with hemiendophytic mycelium. These belong to a distinct\nphylogenetic lineage within the Erysiphaceae. To date, only a single\ndraft genome assembly is available for this clade, determined in\nLeveillula taurica. Here, we generated the first draft genome assemblies\nof Pleochaeta shiraiana and Phyllactinia moricola, two tree-parasitic\npowdery mildew species with hemiendophytic mycelium, representing two\ngenera that have not been investigated with genomics tools yet. Together\nwith the draft genome of L. taurica, these resources will be pivotal for\nunderstanding the molecular basis of the lifestyle of these fungi, which\nis unique within the Erysiphaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery mildew fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135011.phy"}]}
