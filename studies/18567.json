This species differs\nmorphologically from other species in the genus by its determinate\nsynnemata, ellipsoidal conidia, and globose phialides. The phylogenetic\nanalyses based on four loci (EF1a, RPB1, RPB2 and TUB), strongly support\nthe novel species designation of this fungus within the Metarhizium\ngenus, Metarhizium dendrolimatilis sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98592.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98593.phy"}]}
