In New Zealand, one of the most recognizable and common\nCortinarius species is the purple sequestrate fungus, C. porphyroideus.\nWe used genome skimming of the almost 100-year-old type specimen from C.\nporphyroideus to obtain the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and\npartial large ribosomal subunit (LSU) sequence. The phylogenetic\nposition of C. porphyroideus was established and we find that it\nrepresents a rarely collected species. Moreover, we illustrate that the\ncommonly collected purple sequestrate Cortinarius actually represents\nmultiple cryptic species. In doing so, we describe four new species of\nCortinarius with strong morphological similarity to C. porphyroideus:\nCortinarius diaphorus, C. minorisporus, C. purpureocapitatus, C.\nviolaceocystidiatus. Based on molecular evidence, Thaxterogaster viola\nis recognized as Cortinarius violaceovolvatus var. viola. These species\nare associated with Nothofagus (Southern beech) and have very similar\nmorphology to C. porphyroideus, but are all phylogenetically distinct\nbased on the ITS region and the LSU.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121307.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121308.phy"}]}
