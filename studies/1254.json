Thirty-five species of Physalis and\neight physaloid genera were sequenced. Data analysis included Bayesian\nand maximum parsimony methods. The Physalinae was monophyletic, but\nwhile the morphologically typical Physalis species formed a strongly\nsupported clade, the morphologically atypical species made the genus\nparaphyletic. A grade of physaloid genera (Quincula, Oryctes, and\nChamaesaracha) and Physalis subgenus Physalodendron separate P.\nalkekengi, P. carpenteri, and P. microphysa from other Physalis species.\nThe monophyletic Physalis clade consists of Margaranthus and species\nwith solitary yellow flowers and highly inflated calyces. Most sections\nof Physalis do not appear to be monophyletic. The Central American\nphysaloid genera Brachistus, Leucophysalis viscosa, Tzeltalia, and\nWitheringia formed a clade at the base of the Physalinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1965.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes Consensus","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1966.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1967.phy"},{"tree_label":"Waxy Bayes Consensus","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1969.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined Bayes","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1970.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 55 MP Strict","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1971.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 55 Bayes Consensus","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physalinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1972.phy"}]}
