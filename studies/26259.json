Morphologically,basiodiomata of C. cystidiata\ndiffers from that of other described Clavaria species by their strong\ngarlic-smelling yellowish basidiomata, and by the prominent presence of\nversiform cystidia. Molecular analyses using nuclear rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region also reveals the phylogenetic\ndistinction of C. cystidiata within the Clavariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125651.phy"}]}
