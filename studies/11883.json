Phylogenetically the new taxon is closely\nrelated to L. alata. The aquatic species is characterized by having\nnearly smooth or slightly ridged stems, and sepals that are often longer\nthan capsules. Reciprocal monophyly of sisters L. pseudoalata and L.\nalata was recovered and significantly supported based on nucleotide\nsequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (nrITS).\nMolecular dating revealed that the two species may have split for some\n1.08 million years.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The ML tree of Ludwigia sect. microcarpium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48535.phy"}]}
