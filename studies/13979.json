These enzymes probably represent several separate horizontal\ntransfer events. Retention of such sequences may be an advantage for\ntolerance to stresses such as desiccation or nutrient depletion for\nsimple eukaryotes that lack more sophisticated adaptations available to\nmulticellular organisms. We propose that the acquisition of encoding\nsequences for these enzymes by horizontal transfer enhanced the ability\nof early plants to colonise the land. The improved ability to sequester\nand release inorganic phosphate for carbon fixation by photosynthetic\nalgae in the ocean may have accelerated or even triggered global\nglaciation events. There is some evidence for DNA sequences encoding\nPPKs in a wider range of eukaryotes, notably some invertebrates, though\nit is unclear that these represent functional genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Final Fig 2 treebase","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61318.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61319.phy"}]}
