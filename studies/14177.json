In this\nstudy, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of 207 Indian\nColletotrichum isolates, belonging to the species complex, associated\nwith symptomatic and asymptomatic tissues of mango. Phylogenetic\nanalyses were performed based on a 6-gene dataset (act, cal, chs1,\ngapdh, ITS, tub2), followed by ApMat gene sequence-analysis. The\nApMat-gene-based phylogeny was found to be superior as it provided finer\nresolution in most of the species-level clades. Ineterestingly, the\nApMat gene marker identified seven lineages within C. siamense sensu\nlato, including C. jasmini-sambac, C. hymenocallidis, C. melanocaulon,\nC. siamense sensu stricto and three undesignated, potentially novel\nlineages. In this study, C. fragariae sensu stricto, C. fructicola, C.\njasmini-sambac, C. melanocaulon and five undesignated, potentially novel\nlineages were found to be associated with mango tissues. There is a need\nto develop a consensus among mycologists as to which genes should be\nused to define and delimit a Colletotrichum species and in the mean time\nmycologists should voluntarily restrain from describing new species\nbased on inadequate datasets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64395.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64396.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64398.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64399.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64400.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64402.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64403","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64403.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64404.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64405.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64406","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64406.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64407","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64407.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64408","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64408.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64409","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64409.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64411.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64413","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64413.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64414","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64414.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64415","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64415.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64416","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64416.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64417","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64417.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64393.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64401.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64412","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64412.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64394.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64397.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64410","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64410.phy"}]}
