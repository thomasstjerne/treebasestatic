In this study and in order to\nidentification of Alternaria species isolated from cabbage leaf spot\ndisease, a previously undescribed species was identified, which is\ndescribed and illustrated as Alternaria persica sp. nov. This species\nfalls within the Alternaria section Japonica based on morphological\ncharacteristics and multigene phylogenetic analyses. The production of\nmostly solitary, rarely in a chain containing 2-3 conidia, both from the\naerial hyphae and hyphae growing on the surface of culture medium;\nconidia with wide and darkened longitudinal/transverse septa;\nbrownish-black, reticulate/punctate mature conidia and chlamydospore\nlike structures formed from conidiophore cells distinguishes this new\nspecies from the two, previously described species in the section\nJaponica. Pathogenicity tests were done on cabbage leaves under\ngreenhouse conditions and characteristic lesions were formed on\ninoculated leaves. Re-isolation of the inoculated fungus from the\ntreated leaves confirmed KochÂ’s postulates. Further studies are needed to\ndetermine seed transmission potential of this new species, its effects\non seed germination and pathogenicity on other cruciferous crops.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria persica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117047.phy"}]}
