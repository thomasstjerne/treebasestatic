In 1993, the\nsite was re-opened and yielded two additional vertebrae: one posterior\ndorsal and one proximal caudal vertebra. On the basis of the size and\nshape of the vertebrae and the absence of identical bones from the type\nlocality, we conclude that these vertebrae belong to the same individual\nas the holotype of P. sirindhornae and consider them as topotypes. A\nphylogenetic analysis, which for the first time includes recently\ndescribed cranial and postcranial material, indicates that\nPhuwiangosaurus is a basal member of Titanosauriformes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sauropoda results","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55888.phy"}]}
