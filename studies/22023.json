Two forms have been recognized: Cebuella pygmaea\npygmaea (Spix, 1823), and C. p. niveiventris Lönnberg, 1940. In this\nstudy, we investigated if the separation of pygmy marmosets into these\ntwo clades can be corroborated by molecular data. We also examine and\ncompare coloration of the pelage in light of the new molecular results.\nWe analyzed the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and, for the first time for any\nNeotropical primate, we used a reduced representation genome sequencing\napproach (ddRADseq) to obtain data for recently collected,\ngeographically representative samples from the Rio Japurá, a northern\ntributary of the Rio Solimões and from the Javarí, Jutaí, Juruá, Madeira\nand Purus river basins, all tributaries south of the Solimões. We\nestimated phylogenies and diversification times under both maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian inference criteria. Our analysis showed two\nhighly supported clades, with intraclade divergences much smaller than\ninterclade divergences, indicating two species of Cebuella: one from the\nRio Japurá and one to the south of Solimões. The interpretation of our\nresults in light of the current taxonomy is not trivial however.\nLönnberg stated that the type of Spixs pygmy marmoset (type locality\n‘near Tabatinga’) was obtained from the south of the Solimões, and his\ndescription of the distinct niveiventris from Lago Ipixuna, south of the\nSolimões and several kilometres east of Tabatinga, was based on a\ncomparison with specimens that he determined as typical pygmaea that\nwere from the upper Rio Juruá (south of the Solimões). As such it\nremains uncertain whether the name pygmaea should be applicable to the\npygmy marmosets north of the Rio Solimões (Tabatinga type locality) or\nsouth (near Tabatinga but across the Solimões). Finally, our analysis of\npelage coloration revealed three phenotypic forms: 1) south of the Rio\nSolimoes, 2) Eirunepé-Acre, upper Juruá basin; and 3) Japurá. More\nsamples from both sides of Solimões in the region of Tabatinga will be\nnecessary to ascertain the exact type locality for Spixs pygmaea and to\nresolve the current uncertainties surrounding pygmy marmoset\ntaxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109043.phy"}]}
