Cortinarius callisteus, C.\ninfucatus and C. neocallisteus sp. nov. have a broad distribution,\nextending from western North America to Europe. Cortinarius tofaceus is\nknown from eastern North America and Europe, and C. callistei sp. only\nfrom one locality in Sweden. Species are mainly associated with\nconiferous trees. Type specimens of the names associated with this\nsubgenus were studied, and a neotype is proposed for C. tofaceus and an\nepitype for C. infucatus. Barcodes for the species are deposited in\nRefSeq and UNITE.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95324","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95324.phy"}]}
