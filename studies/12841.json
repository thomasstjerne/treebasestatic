Chloroplast\nDNA sequence data from the intergenic spacers trns-trnG and 3â\ntrnV-ndhC, and from the ndhF gene for 32 species were used to test the\nmonophyly of the genus, examine the relationships among species and\nrelated genera, and analyse the relationship between phylogeny and the\ngeographical distribution of the species. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference were employed to analyse the data. Results showed that\nEscallonia is monophyletic and its sister relationship to Forgesia and\nValdivia was corroborated. We recovered five highly supported clades\nthat are geographically structured, suggesting that the evolutionary\nhistory of the genus may be linked to historical processes like the\nuplift of mountainous systems in South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escallonia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53518.phy"}]}
