Phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated\nLSU-ITS-SSU-TEF1-α-RPB2 sequence dataset reveals that the new species\nforms a distinct sister clade with N. bambusae with high statistical\nsupport (100% ML/ 1.00 BYPP). Neoroussoella alishanense is\nmorphologically similar with the generic type, N. bambusae, but N.\nalishanense is distinct in having larger ascomata and its ascospores\nlack a mucilaginous sheath. While, N. bambusae has smaller ascomata and\nits ascospores are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath. A comparison of\nITS, RPB2 and TEF1-α nucleotide bases shows that they are distinct\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118317","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118317.phy"}]}
