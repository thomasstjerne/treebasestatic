Forty-six taxa representing 19 sections or groups and three\nsubgenera of Poa and two out-group genera, Puccinellia and\nBellardiochloa, are analyzed. Five major and several minor cpDNA groups\nare identified. The cpDNA cladogram is generally congruent with the\nsubgeneric taxonomy of Poa. Exceptions are reclassified or are discussed\nin terms of character incompatibilities and possible reticulation\nevents. The cpDNA tree detected relationships among sections that were\nunresolved using traditional character sets and provides a basis for\npolarization of morphological character states. An assessment of\nbiogeographic events based on the cpDNA tree suggests: 1 ) Poa\noriginated in Eurasia; 2) at least six groups of species independently\ncolonized North America; and 3) two of the latter groups colonized South\nAmerica, and one closely related group colonized New Zealand and\nAustralia. The cpDNA tree provided a conservative estimate of the number\nof amphi-neotropical disjunctions when compared to the known number of\nspecies disjunctions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_434.phy"}]}
