The new genus is\ndistinguished from Neonectria sensu stricto on the basis of\nmorphological differences and biology. The species in Corinectria are\nonly known from conifers from the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The\nphylogenetic analyses of five loci (ACT, ITS, LSU, RPB1, TEF1) support\nthe monophyly of the new genus and those based on ACT, BTUB and TEF1\nsupport the segregation of the new species. Corinectria constrictum was\npreviously reported as “Neonectria” cf. fuckeliana causing cankers in\nPinus radiata plantations in Chile.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106794","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106794.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106796.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106795.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nectriaceae","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectriaceae MrBayes consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106790.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106791.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106792","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106792.phy"}]}
