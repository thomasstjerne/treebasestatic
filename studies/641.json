Two fungi with affinity to the\nDothideomycetes, one from Thailand and one from China, are described\nhere in the new genus Aliquandostipite and included in the new family\nAliquandostipitaceae. Aliquandostipite khaoyaiensis was found in a\ntropical rain forest in Thailand, and A. sunyatsenii in a small stream\nin southern China. Both new species are closely related based on\nmorphological and molecular characteristics and with uncertain affinity\nto other taxa of the Euascomycetes based on phylogenetic analyses of SSU\nrDNA sequences. The distinguishing features of the new species are the\npresence of both sessile and stalked ascomata side by side on the\nsubstratum and the widest hyphae known from ascomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aliquandostipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1155.phy"}]}
