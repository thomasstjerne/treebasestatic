We\ncoupled 33 population genetics and phylogenetic approaches to understand\nspatial structure in fungal 34 populations on a continental scale. Using\n9 microsatellite markers, we characterised gene flow 35 among 16\npopulations of the widespread ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria\namethystina over 36 Europe (i.e. over 2900km). We also widened our scope\nto two additional populations from Japan 37 (104 km away), and compared\nthem with European populations through microsatellite markers and 38\nmulti-locus phylogenies, using 3 nuclear genes (NAR, G6PD and ribosomal\nDNA) and two 39 mitochondrial ribosomal genes. European L. amethystina\npopulations displayed limited differentiation (average FST40 =0.041) and\nvery weak isolation by distance. This panmictic European 41 pattern may\nresult from effective aerial dispersal of spores, high genetic diversity\nin populations, and 42 mutualistic interactions with multiple hosts that\nall facilitate migration. The multi-locus phylogeny 43 based on nuclear\ngenes confirmed that Japanese and European specimens were closely\nrelated but 44 clustered on a geographical basis. By using\nmicrosatellite markers, we found that Japanese populations were strongly\ndifferentiated from the European populations (FST45 =0.416), more than\n46 expected by extrapolating the European pattern of isolation by\ndistance. Population structure 47 analyses clearly separated the\npopulations into two clusters, i.e. European and Japanese clusters. We\n48 discuss the possibility of isolation by distance in a continuous\npopulation (considering some 49 evidence for a ring species over the\nNorthern Hemisphere) versus an allopatric speciation over 50 Eurasia,\nmaking L. amethystina a promising model of intercontinental species for\nfuture studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr46020","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46020.phy"}]}
