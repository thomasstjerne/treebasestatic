Pure cultures of a newly isolated genotypically\ncorresponding strain were examined to gain deeper insight into the\nbiology of this scarcely known species. Morphological and physiological\ntraits, as well as molecular data confirmed an affiliation to\nMortierella alliacea Linnemann. However, the strain showed minor\nmorphological differences to the original description of M. alliacea\n(selected here as lectotype) and to the isolate CBS 894.68 (selected\nhere as epitype) with regard to sporocystospore and chlamydospore\nmorphology. Therefore, an emended species description is provided in the\npresent article. The psychrotolerant fungus is able to grow at\ntemperatures between 0 °C and 25 °C. It lacks the capability to degrade\nstarch, cellulose, lignin, chitin, and lipids. Proteolytic activity was\nonly exhibited at 4 °C. Co-incubated mites were not affected by the\nfungus, indicating that the mites predominantly serve as vectors. The\nfungus limited degradation capabilities suggest that it lives on readily\naccessible carbohydrates in soil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"277","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65772","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65773","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65773.phy"}]}
