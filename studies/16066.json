However, the endophyte species\nthat forming stromata have not been studied. HereIn this study, we first\nidentified the first endophyte in stroma-bearing A. sibiricum (EpichloÃ«\nsp.). Isolated colonies of EpichloÃ« sp. were more smooth and compact\nthan those of EpichloÃ« gansuensis. EpichloÃ« sp. showed longer\nphialides and a faster growth rate in culture. However, phylogenetic\nrelationships based on sequences encoding Ã-tubulin (tubB) and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-Î± (tefA) introns revealed that all\nisolates from stromata were grouped in a clade and showed a close\nrelationship with E. gansuensis. We identified the new isolate as E.\ngansuensis. For The analysis of the stromata, revealed neither\nperithecium nor ascospores were found during morphological and paraffin\nsection observation. Furthermore, the ability of conidia formed on\nstromata to infect new seedlings was tested under the experimental\nconditions. After 3 three months, 20% endophyte-free seedlings became\ninfected by E. gansuensis, whereas while the control group showed no\ninfection of endophyte infection. The results indicated thea potential\nof conidia formed on stromata to mediate horizontal transmission.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE-tubB","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76267","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76267.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE-tefA","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76268","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76268.phy"}]}
