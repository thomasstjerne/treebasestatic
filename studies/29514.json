Secondary sporangia 20 were similar to\nthose of W. bliti and W. amaranthi. The coarsely reticulate epispore of\nthe 21 oospores corresponded to W. amaranthi, although they were smaller\nthan those reported in 22 the same species on A. dubius. The diameter of\nthe oospores was similar to that in W. bliti 23 from A. blitum, whereas\nthe pattern of ornamentation did not correspond to this species. The 24\nphylogenetic analysis confirms that both specimens belong to Wilsoniana\nbut do not 25 correspond to any accepted species within the genus, and\nthey have therefore been designated 26 as Wilsoniana sp. Future research\nlines should focus on the description and taxonomic 27 position of\nspecies in the genus Wilsoniana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood tree of the combined COX2 and ITS\nsequences of white blister rust.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135879.phy"}]}
