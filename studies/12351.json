Seven species are accepted in the\ngenus including two new species, P. belizense from Belize and P.\npusillum from Australia. Sequence analysis of the internal transcribed\nspacer of the ribosomal RNA gene places P. belizense in a monophyletic\nclade with P. acaciicola and an undescribed foliar endophyte. New\ncombinations proposed include P. modestum for Irpex modestus Berk., P.\npronum for Hydnum pronum Berk. & Broome which is an earlier name for\nP. calcareum, and P. venustum for Radulodon venustus Hjortstam &\nRyvarden. Irpex colliculosum Berk. & Broome from Sri Lanka is\nconspecific with P. subvinosum. Two species, Sistotrema ochroleucum and\nRadulum concentricum are not accepted in Pseudolagarobasidium. A key to\nthe species of Pseudolagarobasidium is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudolagarobasidium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56371.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudolagarobasidium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56370.phy"}]}
