This new taxon is characterized by resupinate, smooth and\nmembranaceous basidiomata, monomitic hyphal system with clamps,\ncolourless dendrohyphidia, variable presence of cystidia, and ellipsoid\nto ovoid basidiospores measuring 57 × 3.25.2 μm. The phylogenetic\nanalyses based on the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS)+nc 28S rDNA (28S) dataset of\nCorticiales indicated that the new taxon is nested in Punctulariaceae,\nseparated from other genera with strong support values. Descriptions,\nspecimen photo, and illustrations of the new taxon are provided in this\nstudy. A morphological comparation of the four genera of Punctulariaceae\nis given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136201.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136202","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136202.phy"}]}
