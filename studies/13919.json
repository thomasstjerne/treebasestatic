Phylogenetic\nrelationships of the species were inferred by analysis of ITS and rpb2.\nThe placement of C. brunneovernus in sect. Brunnei, C. fructuodotus in\nsect. Telamonia and C. nauseosouraceus in sect.\nCinnabarini/Uracei/Colymbadini is strongly supported. C. alboambitus\ngrouped with species in the clade /Furvolaesi with a support of 0.83 PP,\nand C. politus with the species in sect. Boulderenses with 0.67 PP. The\ndescriptions of these species are presented and a comparison to similar\nspecies is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Telamonia species (Cortinarius, Agaricales)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60931.phy"}]}
