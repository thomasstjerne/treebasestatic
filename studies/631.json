Fifteen different selective primer pairs\nwere evaluated. No significant differences were observed among primer\npairs, grouped based on the AT% of the selective nucleotides, for\nseveral parameters that define primer utility. Relationship matrices\ngenerated with each group of AFLP primers were highly correlated (r^2\n> 0.92). Isolates were very diverse and could not clearly be grouped\nbased on the geographic locations from which they were obtained. Genetic\nrelationships among isolates were very robust. Relationships were\ndetermined using both the ‘genetic similarity’ method of Nei and Li and\nthe ‘genetic distance’ method of Skroch. We conclude that both methods\nare equally effective for determining intraspecific genetic\nrelationships when the majority of markers are polymorphic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrophomina phaseolina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1115.phy"}]}
