It differs from other\nHelicomyces species in having geniculate conidiophores arising from\nrepent hyphae and also borne on erect setae. Helicomyces torquatus is\ndescribed in this paper as a new record for Taiwan, with new\nobservation. The phylogenetic relationship of H. geniculatus, H.\ntorquatus, and related taxa were sought by comparing the sequences of\ntheir ITS barcode of the nuc rDNA. A synopsis of the 13 accepted\nHelicomyces species is given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Tree","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110114","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110114.phy"}]}
