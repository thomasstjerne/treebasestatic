Phylogenetic analyses were based on sequences\nof ITS, nLSU and rpb2 using methods of Maximum pasimony, Maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses. According to the morphological and/or\nmolecular characteristics, 33 Auricularia species are determined in the\nworld. Six new species, A. camposi and A. novozealandica in the A.\ncornea complex, A. lateralis and A. sinodelicata in the A. delicata\ncomplex, A. africana and A. submesenterica in the A. mesenterica\ncomplex, are described. In addition, two species A. pusio and A.\ntremellosa respectively belonging to the A. mesenterica complex and the\nA. delicata complex are redefined. The morphological characteristics,\nillustrations, ecological habits, hosts and geographical distributions\nof these 33 species are outlined and discussed. Phylogenetic\nrelationships based on the ITS dataset of 28 species and the\nconcatenated ITS+nLSU+rpb2 dataset of 21 species are elluciated and\ndiscussed. In addition, morphological differences and phylogenetic\nrelationships of species in five Auriculara complexes: the A.\nauricula-judae complex, the A. cornea complex, the A. delicata complex,\nthe A. fuscosuccinea complex and the A. mesenterica complex, are\nelaborated. Synopsis data on comparisons of species in the four\ncomplexes are provided. An identification key for the accepted 33\nspecies is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111488.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111489","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111489.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111516.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111513.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111506.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111505.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111504.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111503.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111500","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111500.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111497","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111497.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111495.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111494.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111491.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111515.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111514.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111512.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111511.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111510.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111509.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111508.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111507.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111502.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111501.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111499","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111499.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111498","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111498.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111496.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111493.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111490.phy"}]}
