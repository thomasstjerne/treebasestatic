{"Authors":" James E. Rodman","Year":" 1991","Title":" A taxonomic analysis of glucosinolate-producing plants, Part\n2: Cladistics.","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 16","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 619-629","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" A dataset of 90 putatively homologous characters was\nassembled to analyze phylogenetic relationships among the 15 taxa of\nglucosinolate-producing plants and 11 potential outgroups. The\ncharacters sample a broad range of anatomical, morphological,\nphysiological, and phytochemical aspects of these plants. With or\nwithout glucosinolate characters included in the cladistic analysis, a\nlineage emerges consisting of core Capparales (Brassicaceae,\nCapparaceae, and Resedaceae) allied with Gyrostemonaceae and Tovariaceae\nand affiliated with Bataceae, Salvadoraceae, and the non-glucosinolate\nKoeberlinia. This clade is marked by vestured pitting, curved embryo in\nseed, vacuolar or utricular cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum,\nmyrosin cells, and a fundamentally tetramerous floral construction.\nDrypetes affiliates with Euphorbiaceae, and Limnanthaceae with\nBalsaminaceae, affirming the convergent nature of glucosinolate\nbiosynthesis. Caricaceae, Moringaceae, and Tropaeolaceae remain\nproblematic as do the poorly known genera Akania, Bretschneidera, and\nPentadiplandra. Earlier serological comparisons corroborate some of\nthese alignments, including displacement of Moringaceae from core\nCapparales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"glucosinolate plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1454.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"glucosinolate plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1455.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"glucosinolate plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1456.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"glucosinolate plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1457.phy"}]}
