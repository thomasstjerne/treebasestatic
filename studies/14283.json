A total of 123 species representing 26 genera\nproducing a brown rot were included in the present study. Three DNA\ndatasets (combined LSU-ITS dataset, LSU dataset, ITS dataset) comprising\nsequences of 449 isolates were evaluated using three different\nphylogenetic analyses (Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, Bayesian\ninference). We present a phylogenetic overview of the five main groups\nrecovered: the fibroporia, laetiporus, postia, laricifomes and core\nantrodia groups. Not all of the main groups received strong support in\nthe analyses, requiring further research. We were able to identify a\nnumber of well-supported clades within the main groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"391","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia clade ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63738.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"389","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia clade LSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63739.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"326","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia clade LSU ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63740.phy"}]}
