The species is distinguished\nmorphologically by the light, yellow-green color of the gametophytes,\nmultistratose stem cortex with 2-3 layers of enlarged thin-walled cells,\nround, medium-size (ca. 5 Âµm diameter) outer branch leaf pores,\nscattered inner branch leaf pores, few outer stem leaf pores, and\nabundant, round inner stem leaf pores. Two unique plastid DNA haplotypes\noccur among Barrow area plants of S. beringiensis, and these differ by a\nminimum of three nucleotide substitutions from those of other Alaskan\nSphagnum species in the section Subsecunda. Microsatellite markers show\nthat S. beringiensis is genetically variable despite the fact that all\nplants were sampled from within an area of a few km2 and neither\ngametangia nor sporophytes have been observed. A key to the six Alaskan\nspecies of Sphagnum section Subsecunda is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alaska Sphagnum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5090.phy"}]}
