Evidence from nuclear\nribosomal ITS sequences","Journal":" Taxon","Volume":" 58","Issue":" 4","Pages":" 1153-1167","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" The delimitation of genera within the Persea group\n(Lauraceae) has always been controversial. In an attempt to resolve the\nphylogenetic lines within this group, we analyzed ITS sequences of 61\nspecies of the Persea group (Lauraceae) and 30 other species of\nLauraceae. Several of the traditional genera or subgenera form well\nsupported groups, viz., Persea subgen. Eriodaphne, Machilus, Persea\nsubgen. Persea, and Alseodaphne including Dehaasia. The included species\nof Phoebe form two clades that are unresolved with respect to\nAlseodaphne. However, Persea subgen. Eriodaphne (together with the\nMacaronesian Apollonias barbujana) forms one of the clades of an\nunresolved basal trichotomy within the Persea group, whereas Persea\nsubgen. Persea is well supported as member of an otherwise Asian clade\nincluding Alseodaphne and Phoebe. This indicates that Persea, as\ncurrently circumscribed, is not monophyletic. The affinities of the\nMacaronesian Persea indica are clearly American rather than Asian.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Persea group, Bayesian analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Persea group, parsimony, one of 51,664 trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6630.phy"}]}
