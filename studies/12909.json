Seventeen genera are\nrecognized, including six new genera, three of which described herein.\nSeveral genera referred to the Cheirodontinae in previous\nclassifications are placed as incertae sedis characids for the present.\nTwo large internal cheirodontine clades are recognized as tribes: the\nCheirodontini, based mostly on secondary sexually dimorphic characters\nassociated with the anal-fin rays and ventral pro current caudal-fin\nrays of males; and the Compsurini, new tribe, including those\ninseminating cheirodontines, sharing modified anal-fin hooks and\ncaudal-fin rays and scales. Relationships among the species of the\nCheirodontini are explored in depth, with the proposal of four new taxa.\nThe remaining cheirodontine genera - Odontostilbe=Holoshesthes),\nAphyocheirodon, Pseudocheirodon, Prodontocharax (=Amblystilbe), and\nCheirodontops - are diagnosed in a phylogenetic context, but\nrelationships among them and with the two recognized tribes are weakly\nsupported by ambiguous characters, and these are retained incertae sedis\nin the Cheirodontinae. The consequences of the use of phylogenetically\nnon-informative and informative characters in previous and present\nclassifications of the Cheirodontinae and Characidae are briefly\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheirodontinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53858.phy"}]}
