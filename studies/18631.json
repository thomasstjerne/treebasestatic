This genus was\nproposed in 1990 to replace the genus Phialocladus and nowadays has\nseven formally described species. In addition, several morphotypes have\nbeen characterized for Escovopsis based on their conidial mass\ncoloration: brown, yellow, white and pink conidiated. Escovopsis\ntaxonomic studies are sparse and thus, there are still many questions to\nbe answered. The aim of this study is to describe new species of\nEscovopsis found in Argentina using morphological and molecular\ncharacters. We review and discuss the taxonomy of the genus and related\ntaxa. Herein, we describe five new species: E. longivesica, E.\npseudoweberi, E. catenulata, E. atlas and E. primorosea. Finally, we\nevaluated the morphotypes based on conidia color by means of molecular\ndata to conclude that the brown conidiated clade belongs to the genus\nEscovopsis (sensu stricto) and morphotypes with other colors represent\nlineages warranting new taxonomic description.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood EF1-alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92320.phy"}]}
