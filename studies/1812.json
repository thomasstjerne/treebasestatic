Taxonomic position was assessed morphologically and by AG\ntesting and ITS sequence analysis. Results indicated that R3 is a\nhypovirulent R. solani AG 4. Mechanisms underlying biocontrol towards\nvirulent R. solani and Botrytis cinerea were investigated and\nplant-mediated resistance was followed using biochemical markers of\ndefence (PR1, laminarinase, chitinase). Control apparently relies on\nspatial and nutrient competition in soil, and on systemic induced\nresistance. This is the first report on induction of systemic resistance\nand of defence markers by a hypovirulent strain of R. solani.","trees":[{"tree_label":"not included figure","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratobasidium sp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_660.phy"},{"tree_label":"not included figure","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratobasidium sp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizoctonia solani","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_697.phy"},{"tree_label":"Sup.
