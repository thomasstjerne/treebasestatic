The Baynunah Formation\nhippopotamid belongs to a hippopotamine species distinct from all other\ncontemporary and later species in having a relatively more elongate\nsymphysis, a feature similar to the earlier (and more primitive)\nKenyapotamus. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that this hippopotamine\nis so far the most primitive for which the mandibular morphology is well\nknown. The morphological affinities of the Baynunah species confirm\nbiogeographic links with Africa and indicate no connection between\nAfro-Arabian and southern Asia hippopotamids at this time, between 8 and\n6 Ma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128345","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128345.phy"}]}
