Both the D1/D2 domains of the\nnLSU-rDNA and the complete ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region were analysed with\nmaximum parsimony and Bayesian methods to reveal phylogenetic\nrelationships of the species. All species formed highly supported\nmonophyletic lineages, which is corroborated by their distinct\nmorphology. A key for identification, detailed descriptions,\nillustrations, and data on distribution are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara parasitic on Geraniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_930.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara parasitic on Geraniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_931.phy"}]}
