This genus comprises an estimated 100+ species,\nwith the greatest diversity found in coniferous forests of the Pacific\nnorthwestern United States. Maximum parsimony analyses of 54 nuclear\nribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences including 27\nRhizopogon and 10 Suillus species were conducted to test sectional\nrelationships in Rhizopogon and examine phylogenetic relationships with\nthe closely related epigeous genus, Suillus. Sequences from 10\nRhizopogon type collections were included in these analyses. Rhizopogon\nand Suillus were both monophyletic. Rhizopogon section Rhizopogon is not\nmonophyletic and comprised two clades, one of which consisted of two\nwell supported lineages characterized by several long insertions.\nRhizopogon sections Amylopogon and Villosuli formed well supported\ngroups, but certain species concepts within these sections were\nunresolved. Four species from section Fulviglebae formed a strongly\nsupported clade within section Villosuli. Subgeneric taxonomic revisions\nare presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopogon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3984.phy"}]}
