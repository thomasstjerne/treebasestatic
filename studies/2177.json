Due to high phenotypic variability within species,\nmorphological approaches have often failed to recognize natural taxa,\nand molecular techniques have yet to be applied to many groups. Here, we\nsummarize the levels of paraphyly found for scleractinian corals and\ntest, based on new data, whether paraphyly is also a significant problem\nin the Faviidae, the second-most speciose hermatypic scleractinian\nfamily. Using both DNA sequence and morphological data we find that,\nregardless of analysis technique (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian likelihood), many conventional taxonomic groups are not\nmonophyletic. Based on two mitochondrial markers (COI and a noncoding\nregion) that we amplified for 81 samples representing 41 faviid species\nand 13 genera, five genera that are represented by more than one species\nare paraphyletic, as is the family Faviidae. The morphological\ncharacters currently used to identify these corals similarly fail to\nrecover many genera. Furthermore, trees based on both data types are\nincongruent, and total evidence analysis does little to salvage\nconventional taxonomic groupings. Morphological convergence, phenotypic\nvariability in response to the environment, and recent speciation are\nlikely causes for these conflicts, which suggest that the present\nclassification of corals is in need of a major overhaul. We propose more\ndetailed studies of problematic faviid taxa, using a set of standardized\nmorphological, mitochondrial, and nuclear genetic markers to facilitate\ncombining of data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT 8","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5348.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5354.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 7","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5349.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 6","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5350.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 5","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5351.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 3","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5352.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 4","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5353.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 2","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southeast Asian Faviidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5355.phy"}]}
