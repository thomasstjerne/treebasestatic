Previous molecular studies suggested non-monophyly of\nloculoascomycetes and consequently, Chaetothyriomycetes and\nDothideomycetes were distinguished. We have used sequences of nu SSU\nrDNA, nu LSU rDNA, and mt SSU rDNA to re-evaluate the monophyly of\nloculoascomycetes. 13 new sequences of these regions from 10 species,\nincluding two representatives of Pezizomycetes used as outgroup, were\naligned with sequences obtained from Genbank. A combined data set was\nanalysed phylogenetically using maximum parsimony. The\nChaetothyriomycetes and Eurotiomycetes form a sister-group, supported by\na bootstrap value of 97%, suggesting that loculoascomycetes are not\nmonophyletic. A topology constrained to loculoascomycete monophyly can\nbe rejected as being significantly worse using parametric bootstrapping.\nOur results also indicate that mt SSU rDNA sequence data are useful as\nadditional characters to elucidate the phylogeny of ascomycetes at the\nrank of different classes. Additional data from more representatives of\nthese groups and other ascomycetes are required to clarify whether the\nloculoascomycetes are a paraphyletic or polyphyletic assemblage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"loculoascomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3836.phy"}]}
