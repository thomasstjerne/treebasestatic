Parasite-host relationships contribute\nsubstantially to this, but are poorly known. We describe the results of\na study in which approximately 60,000 corals were searched for parasitic\nLeptoconchus snails (Gastropoda: Coralliophilidae) in the Indo-West\nPacific of Egypt, Maldives, Thailand, Palau and Indonesia. We discovered\nan adaptive radiation of 14 snail species that live in association with\n24 mushroom coral species. The former 14 species are described as new to\nscience. Our molecular data are indisputable, but the species could not\nbe identified after their rudimentary shell characters or impoverished\nanatomical details. Interestingly, the coral hosts also reveal their\nidentities, since none of the host coral species was found with more\nthan one snail species. The complexity of coral reefs is still\nunderrated as is shown here by the application of DNA taxonomy as an\nindispensable approach to unravel cryptic radiations which should be\nknown to understand the functioning of the ecosystem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21560","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21560.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21554.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21555.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1b","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21556","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21556.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21557","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21557.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21558","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21558.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21559","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21559.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21561","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21562","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21562.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21563","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_3","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21564","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21564.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_4","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21566","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21566.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21567.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21569.phy"}]}
