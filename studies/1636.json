Phylogenetic analyses based on\nmaximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference criteria\nrecovered consistently, several well supported clades. Gaillardia\ncomosa, G. gypsophila, and G. suavis, forming sect. Agassizia, were\nplaced sister to the rest of Gaillardia, in which the two major clades\ncorrespond to sects. Gaillardia and Hollandia. Section Hollandia\nconsists of the Gulf Coast G. aestivalis complex. Three major, well\nsupported clades were consistently recovered in Section Gaillardia: (1)\nG. multiceps and G. turneri were sister to an Intermountain clade of G.\nparry, G. spathulata, and G. flava; (2) a paraphyletic G. pinnatifida\nand G. arizonica; and (3) G. pulchella, G. aristata, G. amblyodon, G.\ncoahuilensis, G. mexicana, G. henricksonii, and G. powellii. DIVA\nreconstructed a Chihuahuan Desert origin for Gaillardia, an inference\nconsistent with earlier hypotheses. Major range expansions in Gaillardia\nincluded the following: (1) eastward expansion into central Texas and\nalong the Gulf Coast in sect. Hollandia; (2) northwestern expansion,\nresulting ultimately in the Intermountain clade, but including also G.\nmulticeps and G. turneri; (3) northward expansion of the G. pinnatifida\ncomplex; (4) easterly and especially northward expansion of G.\namblyodon, G. pulchella, and G. aristata; and, possibly, (5) northward\nexpansion onto the Great Plains by G. suavis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of Gaillardia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_779.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of Gaillardia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_780.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of Gaillardia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_781.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of Gaillardia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_782.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of Gaillardia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_783.phy"}]}
