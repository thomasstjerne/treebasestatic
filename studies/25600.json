Although\nthe fruiting bodies were dispersed on the bryophytes growing on a moist\nrock, the hyphae were not associated with the bryophytes cells. Instead,\nwe confirmed that the hyphae loosely surrounded the spherical algal\ncells on unidentified senescent bryophytes to form an undifferentiated\nthallus. The observations by transmission electron microscopy revealed\nthat the algae had a pyrenoid. Morphological characters of B. phycophila\nwere similar to known lichenized fungi in the genus Multiclvula, but\nwere different from those in that it did not form a globular or\nbulbil-like thallus but form an undifferentiated thallus. Molecular\nsequence data of the large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene\nshowed that the species was placed in the family Hydnaceae, but was\nlocated in the independent lineage different from the genus\nMulticlavula. A brief information of its isolate was also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121419","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121419.phy"}]}
