New matK sequence data for eight African Podostemaceae species of\nthe genera Dicraeanthus, Djinga and Ledermanniella\nare combined with sequences representing all major groups in the family\nto test the placement of the African taxa in the family. All\npodostemoids studied from continental Africa form a clade that is sister\nto the Madagascan genera Endocaulos and Thelethylax. The\nsister of this African-Madagascan lineage is the American genus\nPodostemum and all Asian podostemoids. Important morphological\ntransformations involving the African clade include the following: (1) A\nshift from erect to inverted flowers in the spathella is synapomorphic\nfor the African podostemoids, although there is a reversal in\nDjinga. (2) Unilocular ovaries arising via septum loss may be\nsynapomorphic for the African clade. (3) Crustose (i.e.Â foliose,\ndisk-like) roots or very broad ribbons covering the rocky substrate like\na carpet are derived characters of an African subclade consisting of\nDicraeanthus, Djinga and certain members of\nLedermanniella. (4) In several species such as Dicraeanthus\nafricanus and Ledermanniella letouzeyi flowers arise\nendogenously along the stems and in L. letouzeyi even along the\nleaves, a character that has never been observed in any of the Asian or\nSouth American taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Podostemaceae (strict)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_906.phy"}]}
