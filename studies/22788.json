Based on evidence from macro- and micro-morphology, karyology and\nITS and ETS sequence data, we demonstrate that it is actually a member\nof Synotis and closely related to Synotis atractylidifolia. The\nrelationship is further supported by the approximately unbiased and the\nSwoffordOlsenWaddellHillis statistical topology tests. We thus transfer\nthe species to Synotis as Synotis karelinioides and place it in the same\nsection as S. atractylidifolia. Senecio sect. Karelinioidei is\nrecombined as Synotis sect. Karelinioidei for this section, and a\nlectotype of Synotis karelinioides is designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112065.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112066.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112067.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP bootstrap","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112069.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112068.phy"}]}
