A phylogenetic\ntree was generated from multi- locus DNA sequence data of the internal\ntranscribed spacer regions of the nrDNA cistron (ITS), partial actin\n(actA), and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), as\nwell as the partial DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit (rpb2). Based on these results, Pseudocercospora amelanchieris\non Amelanchier and Ps. iwakiensis on Ilex were newly described from\nJapan, and a further 22 types (incl. two neo-, five lecto-, and 15\nepitypes), were designated. The genus Pseudocercospora as presently\ncircumscribed was found to be monophyletic, while the secondary\nbarcodes, actA, tef1, and rpb2 were shown to be well suited to\ndelimitate species within the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora spp from Far East Asia MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101505.phy"}]}
