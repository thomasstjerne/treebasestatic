It is similar to twelve genera,\nAlveolaria, Ceratocoma, Chardoniella, Cionothrix, Cronartium,\nCrossopsora, Didymopsora, Dietelia, Endophyllum, Pucciniosira, Skierka\nand Trichopsora in columnar telia, but can be distinguished by other\ncharacters of telia stage. The new fungus is characterised by telia with\ncylindrical peridium, subepidermailn origin, spores becoming erumpent as\ngelatinous hair-like columns, teliospores catenulate one-celled, mature\nspores of a single chain separated by pedicel-like cells, and basidia\nexternal. Phylogenetic analyses of large nuclear subunit ribosomal DNA\nwith a wide selection of Cronartiaceae, Phakopsoraceae, Pileolariaceae\nPucciniaceae and Pucciniosiraceae rust families which having columnar\ntelia taxa showed that the new genus and species is sister to the genera\nStereostratum but differ in one-celled teliospores with intercalary\ncells.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dolichospora sycopsis-sinensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131438.phy"}]}
