Some of which have associated with rust fungi and plant\npathogenic fungi and play an important role in biological control. In\nthis current work, two specimens were collected from Chiang Mai,\nThailand. We introduce Simplicillium formicae isolated from an infected\nant as a new species and Simplicillium lanosoniveum occurring on\nOphiocordycep unilateralis as a new host record species based on\nmorphological study and phylogenies from analyses of a multigene dataset\n(combined nrLSU, nrSSU, tef-1a and rpb1 sequences) as well as an\nindividual ITS gene sequences data. Morphologically, Simplicillium\nformicae significantly differ from other species in producing\nflask-shaped synnemata and special phialides with intercalary node. The\nnew record species resemble to other strain of Simplicillium\nlanosoniveum in completely solitary, tapering phialides, globose to\nellipsoidal conidia which adhering in slimly head. The host of the new\nrecord species similar to Ophiocordycep unilateralis in single stromata\nwhich emerging from ant host and lateral, hemispherical ascomatal\ncushion as well as flask-shaped perithecia. The key to species of\nSimplicillium was provided to understand the interspecies\nrelationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115927","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115927.phy"}]}
