To infer phylogenetic relationships and to aid in species\ndelimitation, sequences of the internal transcribed spacer 2 and the 5â€²\nend of the large sub-unit nuclear ribosomal DNA were obtained for 25\nrepresentatives of the species complex. Inter- and intracompatibility\ntests between cultured representatives for all specimen groups were\nperformed. Results of phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences were\ncongruent with compatibility results. Gloeocystidiellum clavuligerum\nconsists of two distinct taxa, and G. porosum includes at least two\nintersterile groups of uncertain taxonomic status.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corticiacae Basidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corticiacae Basidiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3823.phy"}]}
