Coalescent\ntheory has demonstrated that gene trees often fail to match lineage\ntrees when taxon divergence times are less than the ancestral effective\npopulation sizes. Suggestions to increase the number of loci and the\nnumber of individuals per taxon have been proposed; however,\nphylogenetic methods to adequately analyze these data in a coalescent\nframework are scarce. We compare two approaches to estimating lineage\n(species) trees using multiple individuals and multiple loci: the\ncommonly used partitioned Bayesian analysis of concatenated sequences,\nand a modification of a newly developed hierarchical Bayesian method\n(BEST) that simultaneously estimates gene trees and species trees from\nmultilocus data. We test these approaches on a phylogeny of rapidly\nradiating species wherein divergence times are likely to be smaller than\neffective population sizes, and incomplete lineage sorting is known, in\nthe rodent genus, Thomomys. We use seven independent non-coding nuclear\nsequence loci (total ~ 4300 bp), and between one and 12 individuals per\ntaxon to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis for eight Thomomys species.\nThe majority-rule consensus tree from the partitioned concatenated\nanalysis included 14 strongly supported bipartitions, corroborating\nmonophyletic species status of five of the eight named species. The BEST\ntree strongly supported only the split between the two subgenera, and\nshowed very low support for any other clade. Comparison of both lineage\ntrees to individual gene trees revealed that the concatenation method\nappears to ignore conflicting signals among gene trees, whereas the BEST\ntree considers conflicting signals and downweights support for those\nnodes. Bayes factor analysis of posterior tree distributions from both\nanalyses strongly favor the model underlying the BEST analysis. This\ncomparison underscores the risks of over-reliance on results from\nconcatenation, and ignoring the properties of coalescence, especially in\ncases of recent, rapid radiations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2f","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_360.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5107.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2g","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5104.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5105.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5106.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5101.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thomomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5103.phy"}]}
