The genus Cheirolophus\n(Asteraceae) represents one of the largest plant radiations in the\nCanarian archipelago. In contrast, only a few species occur in the\nMediterranean region, the putative ancestral area of the genus. Here,\nour main aim was to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic\nhistory of Cheirolophus with special focus on explaining the origin of\nthe large Canarian radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpDNA con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheirolophus cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74789.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA Canarian phylogeography","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Canarian Cheirolophus 32 populations cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74791.phy"},{"tree_label":"nrDNA con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheirolophus ITS-ETS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Beast nrDNA Cheirolophus","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheirolophus nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74790.phy"},{"tree_label":"nrDNA Canarian phylogeography","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Canarian Cheirolophus 32 populations nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74792.phy"}]}
