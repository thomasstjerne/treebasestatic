Two\nnew taxa, Byssosphaeria macarangae sp. nov and B. taiwanense sp. nov are\nherein described. Both species can be distinguished from other\nByssosphaeria species based on distinct size differences in asci,\nascospores and DNA sequence data. A detailed descriptions, micrographs\nand phylogenetic data of the new species are provided and\nillustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112085.phy"}]}
