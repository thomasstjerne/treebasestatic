In Japan, they have two patterns of\nlife-cycle, both are univoltine, but one overwinters at egg and the\nother at nymphal stage. We sequenced and analized COI gene of 33\nindividuals from China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia and USA.\nThe results showed that the US populations include two genotypes and one\nis derived from China. Two different life-cycle patterns in Japan\nevolved from two coloniziation histories, one from North China and\nanother from Taiwan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66382","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66382.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66379.phy"}]}
