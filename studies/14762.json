Both species are similar morphologically to\nGastrotheca monticola, but they differ from that species and from one\nanother in subtleties of coloration and minor variances in size and\nproportions. Gastrotheca aguaruna sp. nov. is from humid forested areas\nin the northern part of the Cordillera Central, whereas G. aratia sp.\nnov. is known from the northern part of the Cordillera Occidental.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PlacementT","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gastrotheca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68075.phy"},{"tree_label":"FinalT","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gastrotheca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68076.phy"}]}
