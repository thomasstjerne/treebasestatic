With 89 genera and 190 species\nincluded, this represents a nearly comprehensive genus-level sampling\nand provides a framework phylogeny for the entire family that helps\nintegrate many previously-published phylogenetic studies within\nSolanaceae. The four genera comprising the family Goetzeaceae and the\nmonotypic families Duckeodendraceae, Nolanaceae, and Sclerophylaceae,\noften recognized in traditional classifications, are shown to be\nincluded in Solanaceae. The current results corroborate previous studies\nthat identify a monophyletic subfamily Solanoideae and the more\ninclusive X = 12 clade, which includes Nicotiana and the Australian\ntribe Anthocercideae. These results also provide greater resolution\namong lineages within Solanoideae, confirming Jaltomata as sister to\nSolanum and identifying a clade comprised primarily of tribes Capsiceae\n(Capsicum and Lycianthes) and Physaleae. Stronger evidence also is\nprovided for the inclusion of Capsicum within a paraphyletic Lycianthes.\nSolanaceae are a predominantly New World group, with several lineages\nrepresented on other continents. Apart from events within Solanum (for\nwhich sampling in this study is inadequate for biogeographic\ninterpretations) the Old World representatives of Solanaceae can be\naccounted for by eight or nine dispersal events.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6299.phy"}]}
