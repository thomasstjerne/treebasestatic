This kind of research is, however,\nhampered by the lack of a sound phylogenetic framework exacerbated by\nthe notoriously low predictive power of traditional taxonomy with\nrespect to phylogenetic relationships in Campanulaceae. Based on a\ncomprehensive taxon sampling and analyses of nuclear and plastid\nsequence and AFLP fingerprint data, Phyteuma is confirmed as a\nmonophyletic group sister to the monotypic Physoplexis, which is in line\nwith their peculiar flower morphologies. Within Phyteuma two clades,\nlargely corresponding to previously recognized sections, are\nconsistently found. The traditional circumscription of taxonomic series\nis largely rejected. Whereas distinctness of the currently recognized\nspecies is mostly corroborated, some interspecific relationships remain\nambiguous due to incongruences between nuclear and plastid data. Major\nforces for diversification and evolution of Phyteuma are descending\ndysploidy (i.e., a decrease in chromosome base number) as well as\nallopatric and ecological differentiation within the Alps, the genusï¿½\ncenter of species diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyteuma, combined data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60446.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"plastid data Phyteuma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60448.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"nuclear data Phyteuma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60450.phy"}]}
