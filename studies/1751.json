This study combines isotopic, molecular and morphological\ntechniques to determine the ecology of C. cinnabarinum. To determine C.\ncinnabarinumâ€™s mode of nutrition, d13C and d15N measurements were\ncompared among co-occuring Calostoma cinnabarinum, ectomycorrhizal\nfungi, saprotrophic fungi and EcM host plants. Ectomycorrhizal root tips\nwere extracted from soil cores collected beneath C. cinnabarinum fruit\nbodies. nrITS sequences were obtained from root tips and screened\nagainst C. cinnabarinum nrITS sequence to determine if they matched.\nRoot tips colonized by C. cinnabarinum were also described\nmorphologically. Calostoma cinnabarinum resembled EcM fungi but not\nsaprotrophic fungi isotopically. Ectomycorrhizal root tips have nrITS\nsequences that match C. cinnabarinum fruiting bodies. Several\nmorphological characters are shared between fruiting bodies and EcM root\ntips of C. cinnabarinum. Results of isotopic, molecular and\nmorphological analyses indicate that Calostoma cinnabarinum is\nectomycorrhizal. Molecular analysis and observations of plant\nassociations suggest Calostoma forms ectomycorrhizae with the\nFagales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletales unrooted","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a bootstrap","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletales bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4766.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b bootstrap","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4767.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4768.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c bootstrap","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russula bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4769.phy"}]}
