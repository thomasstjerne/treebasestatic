Molecular data were used to determine the number of\nmigrations to Madagascar, to clarify the timing of these radiations, and\nto assess the relationships among the endemic taxa. Sequences of matK\nand ndhF were obtained for representatives of all the Malagasy endemic\ngenera in Hibisceae, as well as representative Malagasy species of\nHibiscus and Kosteletzkya. Phylogenetic analysis of these data along\nwith a sampling of outgroups and other major lineages of Hibisceae\nstrongly supported the existence of an exclusively Malagasy clade, the\n/Megistohibiscus clade, which is sister to the rest of tribe Hibisceae.\nHumbertiella, Megistostegium, Perrierophytum, all the Malagasy\nKosteletzkya, and a number of endemic species usually placed in Hibiscus\nare members of /Megistohibiscus and appear to be derived from a single\nintroduction to Madagascar in the mid-Miocene. Other sampled Malagasy\nHibisceae, including the endemic genera Helicteropsis, Jumelleanthus,\nand Macrostelia, were resolved as members of the /Euhibiscus clade,\nimplying at least one additional dispersal to the island.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ndhF ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1031.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matk ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1032.phy"}]}
