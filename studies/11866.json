This move\nchallenges Archaeopteryxs famed standing as ‘the first bird.’ While this\nprovocative hypothesis has the potential to rewrite our understanding of\nearly avian evolution, we find no support for the hypothesis as\npresented. We reanalysed these data using explicit model-based\nphylogenetic reconstruction methods, rejecting Xu et al.s hypothesis and\nproviding strong statistical support for the traditional position of\nArchaeopteryx at the base of Avialae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayes gammaRates consensus","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes equalRates consensus","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48162.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLE gammaRates","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48165.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes gammaRates Deinonychosauria constraint\nconsensus","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes gammaRates exp 100 consensus","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48163","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48163.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML gammaRates bootstrap consensus","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48166","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48166.phy"}]}
