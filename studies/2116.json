The genus\nhas no known teleomorph. A new species, Infundibulomyces oblongisporus\nis described from collections on a senescent angiosperm leaf from\nThailand based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence. Both\nInfundibulomyces species form a monophyletic group in the\nChaetosphaeriaceae (Chaetosphaeriales, Sordariomycetidae) with\nDictyochaeta simplex as a sister clade. There is no previous report of\nthe Chaetosphaeriaceae with a coelomycete anamorph.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MP","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infundibulomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5221.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MB","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infundibulomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5222.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MP","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infundibulomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5223.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Infundibulomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5224.phy"}]}
