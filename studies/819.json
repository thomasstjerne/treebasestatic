The ingroup encompasses\n11 tropical hymenochaetalean species, including those of the most\ndiverse genus (Phellinus) and also of three other genera: Aurificaria,\nHymenochaete and Phylloporia. Three outgroups were selected: Trichaptum\nbyssogenum, Datronia caperata and Auricularia polytricha. Cladistic\nanalysis using parsimony was performed with NONA 2.0, implemented by\nWINCLADA 0.9.99. Cladograms were produced using heuristics search with\nrandom taxon addition sequences, tree-bisection-reconnection branch\nswapping. A total of 17 characters were used in the cladistic analysis\nand treated as non-additive. One most parsimonious cladogram was\nproduced with 30 steps in length, CI = 0.70 and RI = 0.78. Ten putative\nmonophyletic groups were identified. Ingroup monophyly and polyphyletism\nof the genus Phellinus were supported. Basidiospore wall thickness and\nbasidiospore color exhibited high phylogenetic signal.
