Basidiodendron yunnanense is characterised by the\nresupinate basidiomata with reticulate to porulose hymenial surface and\na monomitic hyphal system with generative hyphae having clamp\nconnections, presence of the gloeocystidia and broadly ellipsoid to\nsubglobose basidiospores (56.5 × 4.56 µm). Sequences of ITS gene region\nwas generated, and the phylogenetic analysis was performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The\nphylogenetic topology of Basidiodendron based on a concatenated ITS+nLSU\ndataset revealed that the new species nested in genus Basidiodendron, in\nwhich it was sister to B. luteogriseum, and then grouped with B. alni\nand B. eyrei.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135657.phy"}]}
