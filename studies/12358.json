Recent\nstudies on native trees in southern Africa have revealed an extensive\ndiversity of species of Botryosphaeriaceae, about half of which have not\nbeen previously described. This study adds to this growing body of\nknowledge, by discovering five new species of the Botryosphaeriaceae on\nAcacia karroo, a commonly occurring native tree in southern Africa.\nThese species were isolated from both healthy and diseased tissues,\nsuggesting they could be latent pathogens. The isolates were\ncharacterized based on their morphology and compared to other species\nfor which DNA sequence data are available, in phylogenetic analyses\nbased on the ITS, TEF-1α, β-tubulin and LSU gene regions. The five new\nspecies were described as Diplodia allocellula, Dothiorella dulcispinae,\nDo. brevicollis, Spencermartinsia pretoriensis and Tiarosporella\nurbis-rosarum. Evidence emerging from this study suggests that many more\nspecies of the Botryosphaeriaceae remain to be discovered in the\nsouthern Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from Acacia karroo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75520.phy"}]}
