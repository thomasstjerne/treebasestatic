The emergence\nof increasingly sophisticated methods of macroevolutionary pattern\ninference paves the way for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms\ngoverning these diversification patterns on lineages following their\ncolonization of oceanic islands. Here we infer a comprehensive molecular\nphylogeny for Melanesian Exocelina diving beetles. Recent methods in\nhistorical biogeography and diversification rate inference were then\nused to investigate the evolution of these insects in space and time. An\nAustralian origin in the mid-Miocene was followed by independent\ncolonization events towards New Guinea and New Caledonia in the late\nMiocene. One colonization of New Guinea led to a large radiation of\n>150 species and 3 independent colonizations of New Caledonia gave\nrise to about 40 species. The comparably late colonizations of Vanuatu,\nHawaii and China left only one or two species in each region. The\ncontrasting diversification trajectories of these insects on Melanesian\nislands are likely accounted for by island size, age and availability of\necological opportunities during the colonization stage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90526.phy"}]}
