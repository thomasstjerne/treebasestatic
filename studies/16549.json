In\naddition, previously published rpb2 sequences were used to provide the\nphylogenetic position of species in subgenus Telamonia. Based on these\nresults the new section Disjungendi, subgenus Telamonia is proposed. Six\nspecies belong to this section: C. claroplaniusculus, C. disjungendus,\nC. disjungendulus, C. olididisjungendus, C. orasericeus, and C.\npiceidisjungendus. Of these, C. disjungendus, C. disjungendulus, and C.\nclaroplaniusculus are to date only known from Europe whereas the others\noccur both in North America and Europe. Based on ITS sequences, three of\nthe six species had taxonomic synonyms: C. claroplaniusculus (synonym C.\nhymenoluctus and C. planodepressus), C. disjungendus (synonyms C.\nremauxii, C. conicosordescens, and C. solivagus), and C. orasericeus\n(synonym C. brunneofulvus f. myrtillophilus). This study demonstrates\nhow difficult it can be to identify species only on the basis of\nmorphology and emphasizes the importance of molecular studies of type\nand other specimens particularly in groups with cryptic taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius, subgenus Telamonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78586.phy"}]}
