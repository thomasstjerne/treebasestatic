China, and around 2454 specimens of wood-decaying\nfungi were collected. The present paper summarizes the knowledge of the\nwood-decaying fungi in the studied areas, and 95 species which are\ndistributed in 59 genera, 23 families, 9 orders including their hosts\nand substrates are listed alphabetically. A checklist of wood-decaying\nfungi is given. Sequences of ITS nrRNA gene region of the studied\nsamples were generated and phylogenetic analysis was performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods.\nThe phylogenetic tree showed that nine-ty-five species nested in\ntwenty-three families belonging to nine orders in Agaricomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134649","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134649.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134650.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134646","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134646.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134648.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134647","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134647.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134651.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134652.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134653.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134654","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134654.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134655.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134656","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134656.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134657.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134658.phy"}]}
