Association of\na parasite species with a host species may be either influenced\nprimarily by phylogenetic constraints that cause parasite species to\nco-speciate with their host species, or predominantly by ecological\nparameters that influence all other co-evolutionary scenarios. This\nstudy aimed to investigate the role of co-speciation as well as other\nco-evolutionary scenarios in influencing the assemblages of tapeworm\nparasites (marine cestodes) in skate hosts (Rajiformes) using a\nmodification of the PACo (Procrustean Approach to Co-phylogeny) method.\nThe study found that phylogeny and host ecology are both significant\npredictors of skate-tapeworm relationships, implying that co-speciation\nas well as other co-evolutionary scenarios are shaping these\nassociations. The study also investigated the key ecological parameters\ninfluencing host-switching and found that host diet, distribution depth,\naverage body size and geographical location have a combined effect.\nGiven the importance of parasites in ensuring healthy and stable marine\necosystems, the findings of this study have implications for\nconservation management worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"untitled","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112518.phy"},{"tree_label":"untitled","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112517.phy"}]}
