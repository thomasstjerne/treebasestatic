In this study, we report a novel\nMetarhizium species, Metarhizium nostocoideum sp. nov., with determinate\nsynnemata derived from inter-species recombination events. Putative\nrecombinant sequences were identified with the use of SimPlot and RDP\nprogram. Recombination events were confirmed by bootscaning, using\nputative recombinant sequence as a query. Statistical support for the\npresence of a recombination event was done by the use of GARD program\nand several algorithms, including RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi,\nChimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq in Recombination Detection Program version\n4.22. The result revealed that the recombination parents were\nMetacordyceps chlamydosporia and Metacordyceps pseudoatrovirens. The\ninference of recombination in mitochondrial genes suggests that the\ncombination may through somatic recombination and the Metarhizium\nnostocoideum sp. nov. was a recombinant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metarhizium species HXDX.1006 EF1a RPB2 BTUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89481.phy"}]}
