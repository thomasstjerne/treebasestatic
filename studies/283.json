One\nspecies with globose sporangiola, D. sphaerosporum, was isolated from\ndung collected in Mianwali, Pakistan and is similar to D. elegans in its\ngeneral habit. The second species with obovoid sporangiola, D.\nJioridanum, was isolated from dung collected in Gainesville, Florida,\nand resembles D. robustum. The zygospores of D. hesseltinei have\nhemispherical suspensors and are described for the first time.\nChaetocladiaceae is revived for fungi having branched (dichotomous,\nverticillate) fertile hyphae, pedicellate, unispored sporangiola which\nare produced on fertile vesicles, and sterile spines. Dichotomocladium\nis transferred to Chaetocladiaceae, which contains only one other genus,\nChaetocladium. Chaetocladium and Dichotomocladiurn each are considered\nmonophyletic, and together comprise the monophyletic Chaetocladiaceae.\nKeys are provided to the genera of Chaetocladiaceae and the species of\nDichotomocladium. A list of families and genera currently included in\nMucorales also is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetocladiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1380.phy"}]}
