The primary objective of this study was to characterize the\n16 slow-growing Fusarium strains that were isolated from the roots of\nsymptomatic plants. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of a portion of\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1) and the nuclear ribosomal\nintergenic spacer region (IGS rDNA) indicated the etiological agents\nwere F. brasiliense and a novel, undescribed Fusarium sp. This is the\nfirst report of F. brasiliense outside of Brazil and Argentina and the\nnovel Fusarium sp. causing soybean SDS. Kochs postulates were completed\nfor both fusaria on seven soybean cutivars that are commercially\navailable in South Africa. Results of the pathogenicity experiment\nrevealed that the strains of F. brasiliense and Fusarium sp. differed in\nagressiveness to soybean, as reflected in differences in foliar\nsymptoms, root rot, and reduction in shoot length. Cell-free culture\nfiltrates of the two soybean SDS pathogens from South Africa, and two\npositive control strains of F. virguliforme from the United States,\ninduced typical SDS symptoms on susceptible soybean cultivars in a whole\nseedling assay, indicating that they contained phytotoxins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium brasiliense SDS-SA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96425.phy"}]}
