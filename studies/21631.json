This is\nthe first time sporophytes of V. graminifolia have been observed in the\nUnited States. In order to unambiguously identify both taxa, we\nextracted DNA for each. In the case of V. graminifolia, we used BLAST to\ncompare our results to sequences in GenBank for two plastid loci (rbcL\nand rpoA) to determine its affinities. Because there are no GenBank data\nfor D. petersii, it was necessary to collect an additional specimen of\nthis species for comparison in a phylogenetic analysis. Results confirm\nthe identity of each specimen and provide insight into the biogeographic\nhistory of D. petersii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109784.phy"}]}
