Based on morphological characteristics and combined\nphylogenetic analyses of ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT and TUB2 sequence data\nfrom the sexual and asexual morphs our taxon was identified as a new\nspecies of Colletotrichum. Colletotrichum dracaenigenum sp. nov. is\nintroduced here with a full description, color photographs of\nmorphological characteristics and a phylogenetic tree to show the\nplacement of the new taxon in the gloeosporioides species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ITS GAPDH CHS ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125086.phy"}]}
