ABC transporters are one of the large\ngroups of transporter proteins found both in plants and in fungi. The\ncrucial role of plant ABC transporters in the formation of the\nmycorrhizal symbiosis has been demonstrated recently. Some of the fungal\nABC transporter-encoding genes are also induced during the mycorrhiza\nformation. However, no experimental evidences of the direct involvement\nof fungal ABC transporters in this process are available so far. To\nfacilitate the identification of fungal ABC proteins with a potential\nrole in the establishment of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, we have\nperformed an inventory of the ABC protein-encoding genes in the genomes\nof 25 species of mycorrhiza-forming fungi. Results We have identified,\nmanually annotated and curated more than 1300 gene models of putative\nABC protein-encoding genes. Out of those, more than 1000 models are\npredicted to encode functional proteins, whereas about 300 models\nrepresent gene fragments or putative pseudogenes. We have also performed\nthe phylogenetic analysis of the identified sequences. The sets of ABC\nproteins in the mycorrhiza-forming species were compared to the related\nsaprotrophic or plant-pathogenic fungal species. Our results demonstrate\nthe high diversity of ABC genes in the genomes of mycorrhiza-forming\nfungi and suggest that this gene family has evolved independently in\ndifferent phylogenetic lineages. Via comparison of transcriptomics data\nfrom different species, we have identified candidate groups of ABC\ntransporters that might have a role in the process of the mycorrhiza\nformation. Conclusions Results of our inventory will facilitate the\nidentification of fungal transporters with a role in the mycorrhiza\nformation. They will also contribute to the better knowledge of the\ndiversity and evolution of the family of ABC proteins within the fungal\nkingdom.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88820.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88802.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88801.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88819.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88806.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88805.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"213","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88872.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"389","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88868.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88873","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88873.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"358","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88869","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88869.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"284","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88874.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88870.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88871.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycorrhiza-forming fungi ABC-A_gblocks(2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88787.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycorrhiza-forming fungi ABC-A_gblocks(2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88788.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88795.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88796.phy"}]}
