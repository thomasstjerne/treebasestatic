Two new species of Sinularia with digitiform\nlobules, leptoclados-type surface clubs and unbranched interior\nspindles, are described. An updated maximum likelihood tree of Sinularia\nspecies with leptoclados-type clubs (clade 5C) based on two\nmitochondrial genes (mtMutS, COI) and a nuclear gene (28S rDNA) is\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60736.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60738.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60737.phy"}]}
