We discovered a selfish\nelement causing embryonic lethality in crosses between wild strains of\nthe nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The element is made up of sup-35, a\nmaternal-effect toxin that kills developing embryos, and pha-1, its\nzygotically expressed antidote. pha-1 has long been considered essential\nfor pharynx development on the basis of its mutant phenotype, but this\nphenotype arises from a loss of suppression of sup-35 toxicity. Inactive\ncopies of the sup-35/pha-1 element show high sequence divergence from\nactive copies, and phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that they\nrepresent ancestral stages in the evolution of the element. Our results\nsuggest that other essential genes identified by genetic screens may\nturn out to be components of selfish elements.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"193","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caenorhabditis elegans Y48A6C.4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103980.phy"}]}
