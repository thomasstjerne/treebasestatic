This investigation involved first finding new\nindividuals of PS 1 3 from a search of the Perkins culture collection,\nthen assessing genetic isolation by PSR for old and new members of PS 1\n3, and finally comparing species recognition by genetic isolation as\ndetermined by PSR to species recognition by reproductive isolation as\ndetermined by biological species recognition (BSR) and geographic\ndistribution. To facilitate the search for additional members of the PS,\nwe used the genetic variation originally used to discover Neurospora PS\n1-3 to easily distinguish members of Neurospora PS1 3 from the closely\nrelated species N. crassa and N. intermedia. To increase our chance of\nsuccess, the analysis was performed on N. crassa and N. intermedia\nisolates that were either not clearly assignable to species by BSR using\ntester strains, or that were from the same geographic locations as the\nknown members of PS1 3. Eleven new members of Neurospora PS 1 3 were\nidentified: one new PS1, nine new PS2, and one new PS3. To complement\nPSR, we investigated reproductive isolation using BSR in PS1 3 and the\ntwo other most closely related species, N. intermedia and N. crassa\nusing intraspecific and interspecific crosses. PS1 and PS2 appear\nreproductively isolated because they successfully mated\nintraspecifically and not interspecifically. PS3 isolates successfully\ncrossed with other PS3 isolates, however, they also successfully crossed\nwith N. crassa, as previously reported, indicating that genetic\nisolation can precede reproductive isolation. We compared phylogenetic,\nmating, and geographical data to challenge the use of PSR as the main\ncriterion in the formal description of species and, having failed to\ndiscredit the approach, describe the new species, N. hispaniola (PS1),\nN. metzenbergii (PS2), and N. perkinsii (PS3).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6163.phy"}]}
