Here, the phylogeny of the nudibranch genus\nChromodoris is reconstructed based on partial 16S rRNA, and reveals\nthree major clades. Two southern temperate taxa (Chromodoris ambiguus\nand C. alternata) group with Cadlina species, rendering Chromodoris\nparaphyletic. The remaining two Chromodoris clades appear to be\ndiagnosable on the basis of egg mass structure; one group lays planar\nspiral egg masses and the other lays upright spiral egg masses. There is\nstrong geographic structure in the tree, suggesting that shared colour\npatterns in sympatric Chromodoris species might be the result of\nphylogenetic conservatism rather than mimicry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MP","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodoris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodoris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4446.phy"}]}
