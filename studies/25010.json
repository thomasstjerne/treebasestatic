Most of them were described as local\nendemics of the Transcaucasia. However, species of the P. major complex\nare often difficult to identify, having rather subtle and changeable\nmorphological features that could not be treated as essential. The\nphylogenetic analysis of sequences of the nrITS/ETS and chloroplast\ntrnL-trnF regions (intron and spacer) showed their extreme similarity.\nBased on the molecular evidence and main diagnostic morphological\nfeatures, the nine species of the P. major complex are synonymized under\nP. major. Typifications of seven combinations in Polygala from Western\nAsia and Europe are also clarified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119591.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119592.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119593.phy"}]}
