The\nresulting character information along with other morphological\ncharacters were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among species\nand genera in the family. Peroneutypa, is resurrected to accomodateseven\nspecies and the following new combinations are proposed: Peroneutypa\nalsophila, Peroneutypa arecae, Peroneutypa comosa, Peroneutypa\ncurvispora, Peroneutypa gliricidiae, Peroneutypa kochiana, Peroneutypa\nscoparia and Peroneutypa obesa. A key to species of Peroneutypa is\nprovided. These new taxonomic arrangements, based on phylogenetic\nevidence, are proposed here for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 21B","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4612.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 21A","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4610.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4611.phy"}]}
