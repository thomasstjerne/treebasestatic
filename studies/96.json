To explore this result and the general\ninfluence of fossils on phylogeny reconstruction, we assembled new\nRecent and Complete (extant plus fossil) data sets incorporating new\ndata, advances in treatment of characters, and those changes of Loconte\nand Stevenson that we consider valid. Our Recent analysis yields only\none most parsimonious tree, that of Loconte and Stevenson, in which\nconifers are linked with Gnetales and angiosperms (anthophytes), rather\nthan with Ginkgo, as in our earlier Recent and Complete analyses.\nHowever, the shortest trees derived from our Complete analysis show five\narrangements of extant groups, including that of Loconte and Stevenson\nand our previous arrangements, suggesting that the result obtained from\nextant taxa alone may be misleading. This increased ambiguity occurs\nbecause features that appear to unite extant conifers and anthophytes\nare seen as convergences when fossil taxa are interpolated between them.\nAll trees found in the Complete analysis lead to inferences on character\nevolution that conflict with those that would be drawn from Recent taxa\nalone (e.g., origin of anthophytes from plants with a seed fern\nmorphology). These results imply that conclusions on many aspects of\nseed plant phylogeny are premature, new evidence, which is most likely\nto come from the fossil record, is needed to resolve the\nuncertainties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4321.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4324.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4323.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4322.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1E","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4325.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4303.phy"}]}
