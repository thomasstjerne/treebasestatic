To solve the taxonomic status of C. stuckertiana,\na phylogenetic reconstruction was made based on the D1-D2 domains of the\n28S gene (LSU) combined with the internal transcribed spacer region\n(ITS) and elongation factor 1-alpha (EF 1-Î±), together with the\nmorphologic revision of the lectotype and reference materials. Our\nresults showed three independent, not closely related species within\nPhylloporia. Consequently, C. stuckertiana is transferred to Phylloporia\nand two new cryptic South American species, P. lutiana and P.\nspegazziniana, are described hereafter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"178","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylloporia LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112408.phy"}]}
