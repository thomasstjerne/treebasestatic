In the present study, an isolate\nof Colletotrichum with distinct morphological characteristics of C.\norbiculare was collected in chayote fruits in Antonio Carlos, Santa\nCatarina state, Brazil. Based on morphological and molecular data\n[partial sequences of the regions actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin\nsynthase (CHS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and beta-tubulin 2 (beta-TUB)], the\nisolate reported here (code COUFAL7300) was identified as C.\nbrevisporum. This isolated was pathogenic on chayote and commercial\n(Acclaim, Syngenta) and non-commercial fruits of Cucumis melo from a\nMelon Breeding Program in Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first\nreport of C. brevisporum causing anthracnose on chayote fruits\nworldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91889.phy"}]}
