This new species\nbelongs to the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC) and has an\nanamorph morphologically similar to Fusarium mangiferae and F.\nsterilihyphosum. F. tupiense can be differentiated from other species in\nthe G. fujikuroi species complex on the basis of sexual crosses,\namplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and partial\nsequences of the tef1 and tub2 genes. Female fertility for field\nisolates of F. tupiense appears to be low. PCR with primers specific for\nthe mating type (MAT ) alleles and sexual crosses identified this\nspecies as heterothallic with two idiomorphs. Female-fertile tester\nstrains were developed for the identification of field strains of this\nspecies through sexual crosses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium tupiense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59373.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium tupiense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59374.phy"}]}
