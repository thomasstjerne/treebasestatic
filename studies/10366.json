This\nfungus was isolated frequently from living and fallen leaves of Quercus\nacuta, but rarely or never from other evergreen oaks and Castanopsis\nsieboldii grown at the same investigation site, suggesting that this new\nfungus might have strong host affinity to Quercus acuta. The\nphylogenetic relationships of Beltraniella botryospora and allied\nbeltranioid fungi, such as Beltrania rhombica, Beltraniella sp. and\nBeltraniopsis sp., were estimated by molecular phylogenetic analysis\nusing 28S rDNA D1/D2 region sequences. The constructed phylogenetic tree\nsuggests that beltranioid fungi, including Beltraniella botryospora, an\nascomycete Pseudomassaria carolinensis, which has a Beltraniella\nanamorphic stage, and a hyphomycete Subramaniomyces fusisaprophyticus,\nmake a monophyletic group. This clade is located in the Xylariales\nlineage and is closely related to Amphisphaeriaceae. The phylogenetic\nrelationships of the new anamorphic species and allied fungi are briefly\ndiscussed and a polyphyly of the anamorphic genus Beltraniella is\nsuggested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Beltraniella botryospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86725.phy"}]}
