Cochranea (Heliotropiaceae) consists of\n19 species endemic to the coastal Atacama Desert of Chile and Peru. This\nsection has one of the most restricted geographic distributions and is\nthe largest among the South American sections of Heliotropium. We\nperformed a phylogenetic analysis of a total of 92 species using nuclear\nribosomal ITS, and chloroplast ndhF, rps16 and trnL-trnF sequences, and\nestimated the divergence times of major lineages of the group. Our\nresults suggest that Heliotropium sect. Cochranea is monophyletic. There\nare two main well-supported lineages within the section: one is H.\npycnophyllum, which is sister to rest of the species in the section.\nWithin this second lineage, H. filifolium, H. glutinosum, H. krauseanum\nand a large polytomous group composed of 15 species form a tetratomy.\nThe age estimates using the penalized likelihood method suggests a\nminimum age of 14.0±2.0 My for section Cochranea, and 4.6±0.9 My for the\nlarge polytomous group within it. Heliotropium sect. Cochranea may have\noriginated in the Miocene during the major uplift of the Andes, and then\nradiated in the Pliocene in the Atacama Desert.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boraginales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4894.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliotropiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4891.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliotropiaceae1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4892.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cochranea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4893.phy"}]}
