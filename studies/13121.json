They are also the most intensively studied extinct\ndinosaurs, and thanks to large sample sizes and an influx of new\ndiscoveries, have become ancient exemplar organisms used to study many\nthemes in vertebrate paleontology. A phylogeny that includes recently\ndescribed species shows that tyrannosaurs originated by the Middle\nJurassic but remained mostly small and ecologically marginal until the\nlatest Cretaceous. Anatomical, biomechanical, and histological studies\nof T. rex and other derived tyrannosaurs show that large tyrannosaurs\ncould not run rapidly, were capable of crushing bite forces, had\naccelerated growth rates and keen senses, and underwent pronounced\nchanges during ontogeny. The biology and evolutionary history of\ntyrannosaurs provide a foundation for comparison with other dinosaurs\nand living organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55546.phy"}]}
