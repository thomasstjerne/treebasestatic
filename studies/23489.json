In this study, several endophytic strains were\nisolated from this host. Morphology and analysis of DNA sequences of\nnuclear rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) and seven other gene regions\n(GAPDH, CAL, ACT, CHS-1, HIS, GS, TUB2) revealed a new species,\nColletotrichum yulongense and a previously described species, C.\nrhombiforme. Both Colletotrichum species are described. The diversity\nand broad distribution of the host, suggest the likelihood of other\nendophytic Colletotrichum species in V. dunalianum var. urophyllum and\nthis requires further investigation. The pathogenicity of the\nColletotrichum species isolated from V. dunalianum var. urophyllum also\nneeds testing.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ITS GAPDH CHS HIS3 ACT TUB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ACT CAL CHS GAPDH ITS TUB2 GS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114635.phy"}]}
