Previous studies placed Yunganastes\nwithin the genera Craugastor, Eleutherodactylus or Pristimantis,\ncurrently in three different families: Craugastoridae,\nEleutherodactylidae, and Strabomantidae. We study the phylogenetic\nrelationships of Yunganastes using Bayesian analyses of 1300 base pairs\nof the 16S and 12S mtDNA genes. Our dataset includes 375 species\nrepresenting all major groups of Terrarana. The clade Yunganastes is\nnested within the family Strabomantidae, but not within any of the\ndescribed genera. The phylogenetic position of Yunganastes and a\nmorphological synapomorphy are used as criteria to raise the clade to\nthe genus level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"375","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Yunganastes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6111.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML bootstrap 50 Majority-Rule concensus","ntax":"375","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Yunganastes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6205.phy"}]}
