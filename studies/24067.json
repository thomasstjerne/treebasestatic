Three data partitions: complete plastomes, rare\ngenomic changes (RGC), and a combined plastome and RGC data matrix, were\nanalyzed. Overall, 156 non-ambiguous RGC were identified, of which\nhomology was inferred for 38 RGC. Among the 38 RGC identified, six were\nsynapomorphic among the Group 1 subtribes: Aveninae, Agrostidinae, and\nAnthoxanthinae, and 27 were synapomorphic among the Group 2 subtribes:\nLoliinae, Ammochloinae, Parapholiinae, Dactylidinae, Poinae, and\nColeanthinae. Four RGC were determined to be homoplasious in Groups 1\nand 2. Two other RGC originated through intrastrand deletion events. The\nremaining RGC events likely originated through recombination given their\nsize and lack of sequence evidence for other types of mutations. This\nstudy also determined that relationships between taxa, even those only\nweakly supported in previous studies, could be inferred with strong\nsupport when utilizing complete plastomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pooidae G1G2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116747.phy"}]}
