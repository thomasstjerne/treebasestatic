The fungus is characterized by aseptate, dark brown,\ncircular lenticular conidia with hyaline margin (some are deformed);\nbroad, hyaline conidiophores with numerous brown septa and ampulliform\nto lageniform conidiogenous mother cells. The new species superficially\nresembles A. phaeospermum and A. saccharicola in having circular\nlenticular conidia, but differs in the size of its conidia, conidiophore\nmorphology, size and conidiogenous cells. Phylogenetic study using\nsequence analysis of ITS region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) separates thenew\nspecies (A. jatrophiae) from other related species of Arthrinium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arthrinium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63715.phy"}]}
