Vignea (Cyperaceae) Based on\nnon-coding nrDNA Sequence Data","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 31","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 70-82","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Carex subg. Vignea is characterized by sessile, bisexual\nspikes, distigmatic flowers, and the lack of cladoprophylls. Phylogenies\nreconstructed using nrDNA internal and external transcribed spacer (ITS\nand ETS 1f) sequences for 100 vignean taxa support this subgenus as\nmonophyletic. The atypical C. gibba is sister to all remaining taxa. A\nnumber of clades of the remainder of the subgenus do not correspond to\neasily defined morphological groups, with species representative of\nseveral disparate sections frequently contained within a single clade.\nMany traditionally recognized sections are not supported, although\nothers such as sects. Ovales, Stellulatae, and Glareosae are\nmonophyletic. Tree topologies suggest that gynaecandry has evolved\nmultiple times in subg. Vignea. Species of uncertain subgeneric affinity\nare variously placed in our analysis. Carex fecunda, previously linked\nto subg. Vignea, is positioned within the outgroup composed of species\ntraditionally placed in subg. Carex and Vigneastra. While species with\nhighly compound inflorescences are often regarded as ancestral in Carex,\nour results suggest that this inflorescence type has evolved multiple\ntimes and is derived within the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex, strict of 1017 MP trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2190.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2191.phy"}]}
