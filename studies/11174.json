Here, we apply several\napproaches for understanding species-level relationships using data from\n18 nuclear DNA loci and one mtDNA locus within currently described\nspecies and subspecies of Sistrurus rattlesnakes. Collectively, these\nmethods provide evidence that a currently described species, the\nmassasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus), consists of two\nwell-supported clades, one composed of the two western subspecies (S.\nc. tergeminus and S. c. edwardsii) and the other the eastern subspecies\n(S. c. catenatus). Within pigmy rattlesnakes (S. miliarius), however,\nthere is not strong support across methods for any particular grouping\nat the sub-specific level. Monophyly-based tests for taxonomic\ndistinctiveness show evidence for distinctiveness of all subspecies but\nthis support is strongest by far for the S. c. catenatus clade. Because\nsupport for the distinctiveness of S. c. catenatus is both strong and\nconsistent across methods, and due to its morphological distinctiveness\nand allopatric distribution, we suggest that this subspecies be elevated\nto full species status, which has significant conservation implications.\nFinally, most divergence time estimates based upon a fossil-calibrated\nspecies tree are > 50% younger than those from a concatenated gene\ntree analysis and suggest that an active period of speciation within\nSistrurus occurred within the late Pliocene/Pleistocene eras.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CBA","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27448.phy"},{"tree_label":"CL11","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27447.phy"},{"tree_label":"CL51A","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27445.phy"},{"tree_label":"fgb","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27437.phy"},{"tree_label":"est2a1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27436.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27435.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl31","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27434.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPD","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27444.phy"},{"tree_label":"TBP","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27443.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl1f","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27432.phy"},{"tree_label":"aclone","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27442.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl25","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27433.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl63","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27441.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAM","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27431.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl61","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27446.phy"},{"tree_label":"ausnp4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27439.phy"},{"tree_label":"cl41","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27440.phy"},{"tree_label":"od","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27438.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sistrurus rattlesnakes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27449.phy"}]}
