Its\nphylogenetic relationship to cultivated T. gesneriana is still under\ndiscussion. We used sequences from psbE-petL region of cpDNA and the\ncomplete nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA to\nexamine the genetic variability of T. suaveolens specimens from European\nRussia and the adjoining regions. Our dataset also included 8 varieties\nof cultivated T. gesneriana. The research on biogeographic patterns of\nplastid haplotype and nuclear ribotype distribution has proven a working\nhypothesis that their origin and dispersal over the Lower and Middle\nVolga Region are linked to the Khazar or Early Khvalynian transgression\nof the Caspian Sea and subsequent events. In the Crimea and the adjacent\nregions, the pattern of haplotypes distribution indicates that their\norigin and expansion may be linked to the Karangat transgression of the\nBlack Sea and the subsequent New Euxinian regression. Research has shown\nthe complete identity of DNA sequences of T. gesneriana cultivars and T.\nsuaveolens wild plants. Therefore, we propose that T. suaveolens is T.\ngesnerianas likeliest wild ancestor which has not been discovered\nearlier due to the lack of complex studies of the species polymorphic\nnature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree
