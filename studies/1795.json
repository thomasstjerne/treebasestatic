(Caesalpinioideae: Leguminosae)\ncontains a large number of genera that produce resins, but which\npreviously had been placed in different generic groups. To test the\nmonophyly of the resin-producing Detarieae and to examine phylogenetic\nrelationships among these genera we analyzed sequences from the\nchloroplast trnL intron and trnL-F spacer for more than 80 taxa and from\nthe nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) for over 50\ntaxa. The two chloroplast regions were highly congruent, but incongruent\nwith the nuclear ITS data. Incongruence may be the result of\nhybridization, particularly in the Colophospermum and Hardwickia\npolyploid lineage. Resin producing taxa are scattered among two clades,\nthe Prioria and Detarieae s.s. clades, which together are monophyletic,\nbut only with weak support. This group is characterized by the ability\nto produce bicyclic diterpenes. The phylogenetic relationships as\ninferred from molecular data resolved the intergeneric affinities but\nthe main clades obtained are different from the groupings proposed by\nclassifications based primarily on morphological characters. Based on\nthese analyses we propose new generic groupings that correspond to the\nPrioria s.s., Hardwickia, Hymenaea, Eperua s.s. and Detarium\nclades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resin-producing Detarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2748.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resin-producing Detarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2749.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Resin-producing Detarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2750.phy"}]}
