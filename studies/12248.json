It produces non-papillate sporangia,\nsmooth-walled oogonia containing thick-walled oospores, and paragynous\nantheridia. Although morphologically similar to several species within\nITS Clade 6 and sub-clade II; namely P. gibbosa, P. gregata and P.\nmegasperma, phylogenetic analyses of the ITS, coxI, HSP90, BT and NADH\ngene regions demonstrate that P. bilorbang sp. nov. is a distinct\nspecies. Additionally P. bilorbang differs from these species in its\ngrowth and colony morphology on several media. Phytophthora bilorbang\nsp. nov. is believed to be involved in the decline syndrome of\nblackberry within the Warren and Donnelly River catchments in the\nsouth-west of Western Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ALL","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang ALL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50305.phy"},{"tree_label":"ALL BS","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50306.phy"},{"tree_label":"ALL BAYES","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50307.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang ALL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50308.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BS","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50309.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BAYES","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora bilorbang","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50310.phy"}]}
