It is characterized by annual and\npileate basidiocarps, flesh-pink to brown when fresh, concentrically\nzonate pileus with brown to cinnamon brown band, cream to clay-pink pore\nsurface, circular to angular pores (4â“5 per mm) and ellipsoid\nbasidiospores (4.0â“5.1 Â´ 2.1â“3.0 Âµm). Phylogenetic analysis based on\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and nuclear large subunit\n(nLSU) ribosomal RNA gene regions supported D. americana as a\ndistinctive new species belonging to Daedalea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daedalea americana sp. nov.
