Radiometric age estimates of the strata in which the taxon occurs\nare 400Â–500 kyr. The new species is distinct from all other known species\nof Stephanodiscus because it possesses a highly pronounced double\nconcentric undulation and two distinct arrangements of central strutted\nprocesses. Cladistic analysis is used to identify the phylogenetic\nposition of this taxon with respect to other Stephanodiscus\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED+","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stephanodiscus kusuensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25652.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stephanodiscus kusuensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25655.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stephanodiscus kusuensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25654.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stephanodiscus kusuensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25653.phy"}]}
