Brontornis is\nknown only by scarce postcranial remains, fragmentary mandibles and a\nquadrate bone. All the material comes from the Miocene of Santa Cruz\nProvince, Argentina. A reanalysis of this material indicates that\nBrontornis may be more properly included within the Anseriformes as a\nbasal member of this group, together with Diatryma and the extinct\nfamily Dromornithidae. Its inclusion within the Anseriformes suggests a\nmore complex evolutionary history of the poorly known paleoavifaunas of\nSouth America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anseriformes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31474.phy"}]}
