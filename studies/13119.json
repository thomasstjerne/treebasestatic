Phylogenetic analyses of nurLSU and ITS\nregions revealed that the infrageneric âgroup Favolusâ is divided into\ntwo main clades. Fungi within the group share laterally stipitate\nbasidiocarps, with non-crustose stipe surfaces, and are distinguishable\nby the morphology of the pileus surface. One clade is characterized by\nspecies with hyaline to brown cutis, composed of hyaline to brown\nagglutinated generative hyphae. The other clade accommodates species\nwith radially striate pileus, and lacks any distinct cutis of\nagglutinated hyphae. We propose Neofavolus gen. nov., typified by N.\nalveolaris, for the former clade, and revise the genus Favolus, typified\nby F. brasiliensis, for the latter clade. Neofavolus includes N. mikawai\nand N. cremeoalbidus sp. nov., known only from temperate eastern Asia,\nin addition to N. alveolaris. Favolus includes members of the Polyporus\ngrammocephalus complex, the P. tenuiculus complex, and P.\npseudobetulinus. We reveal that the polypore known as âP.\ngrammocephalusâ in Asia includes F. acervatus and F. emerici (= P.\ngrammocephalus), whereas âP. tenuiculusâ includes three distinct\nspecies; F. brasiliensis from tropical America, and F. spathulatus and\nF. roseus from tropical Asia. Detailed descriptions and illustrations\nare provided for the accepted species in Favolus and Neofavolus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58963.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58957.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58958.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58959.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58960.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP5","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58961.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP6","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58962.phy"}]}
