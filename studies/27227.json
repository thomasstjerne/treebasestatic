However, the\nlack of phylogenetic information for most species prevented any further\nconclusions or changes in their taxonomy. With this in view, we\nperformed phylogenetic analyses using nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK,\npsbD-trnT, rps16-trnQ, trnH-psbA, and trnS-trnG) markers","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurothallidinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127178.phy"}]}
