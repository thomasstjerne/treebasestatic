This\nproperty is induced and maintained by a small number of key\ntranscription factors, of which the POU domain protein, Oct4, is\nconsidered central. Clonal invertebrates, in contrast, possess\npluripotent stem cells life-long, but the molecular mechanisms\ncontrolling their pluripotency is poorly studied. To address this\nproblem, we analyzed the expression pattern and function of Polynem\n(Pln), a POU domain gene from the marine cnidarian Hydractinia echinata.\nWe show that Pln is expressed in the embryo and adult stem cells of the\nanimal. Its ectopic expression in epithelial cells induces stem cell\nneoplasms and loss of epithelial tissue. Neoplasm cells expressed not\nonly endogenous Pln, but also Nanos, Vasa, Piwi and Myc. Pln\ndownregulation by retinoic acid or RNAi in adult animals lead to\ndifferentiation. Downregulation of the gene in early embryogenesis was\nlethal. Our results suggest an ancient role of POU proteins in animal\nstem cells.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"POU Domain Transcription Factor","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31378.phy"}]}
