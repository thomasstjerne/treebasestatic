A first record of this species is reported from Europa\nIsland, an uninhabited territory located in Mozambique Channel.\nWorldwide distribution of H. hydnoides is modeled thanks to ensemble\nmodelling of Random Forest and MaxEnt algorithms and a focus is done in\nthe Indian Ocean, South Asia and North of Australia areas regarding its\npotential presence in regards with the distribution of its known host\ntree species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree_28S_Kalign2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127113","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127113.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_28S_MAFFT","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127114","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ITS1-58S-ITS2-lSU_MAFFT","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127121","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ITS1-58S-ITS2-lSU_Clustal_Omega","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127119","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127119.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_28S_Prank","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127118","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_28S_Clustal_Omega","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127112","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127112.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_28S_MUSCLE","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127116","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127116.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ITS1-58S-ITS2-lSU_Kalign2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127120","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ITS1-58S-ITS2-lSU_Prank","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127123","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127123.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ITS1-58S-ITS2-lSU_MUSCLE","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127122","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127122.phy"}]}
