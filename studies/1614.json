Even when taxa occur\nsyntopically, genetic distinctiveness is maintained (Hertford Co., NC\npopulations of var. macropoda and var. floridana). Clades/clusters\ncorresponding to vars. digitalis and floridana were well supported in\nall analyses. However, the var. macropoda clade was poorly supported on\nmost trees. Despite our inability to fully resolve taxon relationships,\nAFLP data substantiate ongoing morphological and phytogeographic studies\nthat show the presence of additional species diversity within sect.\nCareyanae and the eastern North American Carex flora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UPGMA NEILI","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex digitalis sect.
