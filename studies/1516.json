Using a noninvasive technique for\nsampling nuclear DNA from museum specimens, we investigate the evolution\nof the Tenrecidae and assess the extent to which tenrecids fit patterns\nof relationships proposed for other terrestrial mammals on Madagascar.\nApplication of several tree-reconstruction techniques on sequences of\nthe nuclear Growth Hormone Receptor gene and morphological data for all\nrecognized tenrecid genera supports monophyly of Malagasy tenrecids to\nthe exclusion of the two living African genera. However, both parsimony\nand Bayesian methods favor a close relationship between fossil African\ntenrecs and the Malagasy Geogale, supporting the hypothesis of island\nparaphyly, but not polyphyly. More generally, the non-invasive\nextraction technique can be applied with minimal risk to rare/unique\nspecimens, and by better utilizing museum collections for genetic work\ncan greatly mitigate field expenses and disturbance of natural\npopulations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tenrecs, morph + GHR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tenrecs, morph strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2409.phy"}]}
