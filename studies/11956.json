The taxonomy and phylogeny of turtles are\nstill under discussion, at least for some clades. Whereas in most\nprevious studies, only a few species or genera were considered, we here\nuse an extensive compilation of DNA sequences from nuclear and\nmitochondrial genes for more than two thirds of the total number of\nturtle species to calculate a large phylogeny for this taxon. Our\nresults permit us to discuss previous hypotheses on species phylogeny or\ntaxonomic organisation. We are thus able to discriminate between\ncompeting hypotheses and to suggest which taxonomical modifications\nshould be considered. Finally, we pinpoint the remnant ambiguities for\nthis phylogeny and the next species for which new sequences should be\nobtained to get a better phylogenetic resolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48872.phy"}]}
