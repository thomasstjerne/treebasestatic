The genomes\nfrom the provisional taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ also underly these\nprocesses, which even include the loss several central pathways. These\nobligatory biotrophic bacteria form one clade of the Acholeplasmataceae,\nwhile the second genus, Acholeplasma, comprises species harbouring a\ncomparatively broad genetic repertoire that is necessary for a\nsaprophytic lifestyle. In contrast to many core genes of\nAcholeplasmataceae, the ribosomal rescue system has not yet been\nexamined in detail. Therefore, complete genomes from the family were\nre-examined with respect for ssrA encoding the tmRNA and its associated\nbinding-protein SmpB. The analysis of the key genes of the\ntrans-translation system reveals particular proteolysis tag peptides,\nconserved coding and associated gene context in addition to the\nsuccessful application of SmpB in phylogenetic analysis. The results\nhighlight the importance of the ribosomal rescue system for phytoplasmas\neven under conditions of rapid genome evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129201.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129286","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129286.phy"}]}
