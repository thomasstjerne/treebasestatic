On the basis of\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic evidence of DNA sequences of\nmultiple loci including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions,\nthe large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA\ngene sequences (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-α gene\n(EF1-α), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1), the second\nlargest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and β-tubulin gene\nsequences (β-tubulin). The phylogenetic results indicate that Polyporus\ns. l. is a polyphyletic group while genus Picipes is monophyletic with\nbrown to black stipe, poroid hymenophore, dimitic hyphal system with\nstrongly branched and uninflated skeleto-binding hyphae, and oblong to\ncylindrical basidiospores. Nine new combinations and four new species of\nPicipes, Pi. baishanzuensis, Pi. subtropicus, Pi. subtubaeformis and Pi.\ntibeticus, are proposed. A key to species of Picipes is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanopus ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97500.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanopus ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97501.phy"}]}
