Based on three genomic regions studied, entire\nITS, 5¬¥end of 28S and EF-1\u001a±, both species formed strongly supported\nmonophyletic clades and closely phylogenetic relationships with the\nspecies to which it is morphologically most similar.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sporormiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4373.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sporormiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4374.phy"}]}
