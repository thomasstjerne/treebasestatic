It is characterized by having\nresupinate basidiomata with oblique tube layer, with fusoid cystidioles\npresenting in hymenium, and cylindrical basidiospores. Based on multiple\nloci DNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the\nlarge subunit (nLSU), and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2)\nregions, our phylogeny strongly supported R. tianshanensis as a\ndistinctive species belonging to Rhodonia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110258","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110258.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110259.phy"}]}
