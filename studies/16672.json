Morphologically similar to Piromyces but genetically quite\ndistinct, this fungus (isolate GE09) was first isolated from buffalo\nfaeces in west Wales and then subsequently isolated from sheep, cattle\nand horse in the same area. Phylogenetic analysis of LSU and ITS\nsequence confirmed that B. eastonii isolates formed a distinct clade\nclose to the polycentric Anaeromyces spp. The morphology of GE09 is\nmonocentric with monoflagellate zoospores. However, the sporangial stalk\n(sporangiophore) was often distinctly swollen and the proximal regions\nof the rhizoidal system twisted in appearance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
