Whereas the biology of many arenicolids\nis well known, the phylogenetic relationships of these worms are\ninadequately studied. A close relationship of Arenicolidae and\nMaldanidae is generally accepted. The phylogenetic relationships of\narenicolid taxa were reconstructed based on sequence data of the\nmitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, the nuclear 18S rRNA gene, and a small\nfraction of the nuclear 28S rRNA gene. Members of all described\narenicolid genera are included in the data set. Phylogenetic analyses\nwere conducted using Maximum Likelihood, Bayesian inference, and Maximum\nParsimony. The monophyly of the Maldanidae, as well as of the\nArenicolidae is supported by all conducted analyses. Two well supported\nmajor clades are highest ranked sister taxa in the Arenicolidae: one\ncontaining all Abarenicola species and one containing Arenicola,\nArenicolides, and Branchiomaldane. Evidence is given for a closer\nrelationship between the two investigated Branchiomaldane species and\nArenicolides ecaudata in the combined analysis. In the light of the\nmolecular data the best explanation for structural and morphological\nobservations is that Branchiomaldane evolved by progenesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arenicolids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arenicolids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4452.phy"}]}
