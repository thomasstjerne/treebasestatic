Apothecia of this fungus emerge from linear, black\npseudosclerotia on rachises and petioles of Fraxinus platypoda. In\nculture, the species forms a Chalara anamorph similar to that of H.\nfraxineus. In addition, a Sporotrichum-like synanamorph is produced.\nSpores of neither anamorphic forms germinate on malt extract agar and\nmight act solely as spermatia. After prolonged incubation, ascocarps are\nproduced directly on agar plates, indicating the ability to\nself-fertilize. Phylogenetic investigations using four sequence markers\nplaced the species alongside H. albidus, H. albidoides, and H.\nfraxineus. Eight fungal strains, co-occurring with H. linearis on\npetioles of F. platypoda, were isolated and identified by sequencing the\nITS region of the rDNA. Seven different species were revealed, showing\nthat there is no other dominant fungus on petioles of F. platypoda.\nPathogenicity tests on Fraxinus excelsior and its native host F.\nplatypoda revealed that the fungus is avirulent. The close phylogenetic\nrelationship with H. fraxineus and the avirulence of H. linearis offer\nan opportunity to study the evolution of pathogenicity of H. fraxineus\nin further detail in the future.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides Concatenated MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77151.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77156.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77155.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77152.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77153.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus albidoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77154.phy"}]}
