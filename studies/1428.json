This\nspecies is described as a new species, Resupinatus porosus. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of ribosomal DNA sequences support the inclusion of this fungus\nin the clade containing Resupinatus, and indicate that this monophyletic\ngroup also includes members of Asterotus and the cyphelloid genus\nStigmatolemma. Resupinatus porosus is another example of tropical poroid\nrepresentatives of lamellate agaric genera. Resupinatus is emended to\ninclude species with poroid (R. porosus) or merulioid (R. merulioides)\nhymenophore as well as those with laterally stipitate (Asterotus) and\ncyphelloid (Stigmatolemma) fruiting bodies. Seven new combinations in\nResupinatus are proposed to accommodate well-known species of\nStigmatolemma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2p","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Cyphelloid Genus Stigmatolemma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Cyphelloid Genus Stigmatolemma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_651.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Cyphelloid Genus Stigmatolemma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_652.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Cyphelloid Genus Stigmatolemma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_692.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Cyphelloid Genus Stigmatolemma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2287.phy"}]}
