This new species differs\nmarkedly in morphology from previously known congeneric species. It is\ncharacterized by its shrubby habit, the woody stems are up to 1 m tall,\nthe leaves cluster at the top of the woody stems, the involucral bracts\nare ovate and unequal, the bracteoles are usually ovate or suborbicular\nand the pedicels of the fruits exceed the bracteoles. Both morphological\nand molecular phylogenetic analyses support it as a distinct species\nbelonging to subgenus Bupleurum. Relationships to other woody species of\nBupleurum are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bupleurum dracaenoides ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60082.phy"}]}
