It has taxonomic affiliations with\nLycoperdaceae, Broomeiaceae, and Sclerodermataceae. This study samples\nITS and 28S ribosomal genes from three D. wrightii specimens to\ndetermine this species phylogenetic placement, and to determine the\nspecies closest relatives. Results of database searches and phylogenetic\nanalysis indicate this species to be a member of the Sclerodermatineae,\nand most closely related to the genera Astraeus and Tremellogaster.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sclerodermatineae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4679.phy"}]}
