Presumed sister to all\nother Asteraceae, its intergeneric relationships are key to\nunderstanding the early evolution of the family. Results of the only\nmolecular study on the subfamily conflict with relationships inferred\nfrom morphology. We investigate inter- and intrageneric relationships in\nBarnadesioideae with novel DNA sequence data and morphological\ncharacters using parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian inference. Competing\nphylogenetic hypotheses, both previous and present, are evaluated using\nlikelihood-based tests. Evolutionary trends within Barnadesioideae are\ninferred.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 left","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Barnadesioideae, seven chloroplast markers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6457.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 right","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Barnadesioideae, seven chloroplast, nuclear markers,\nplus indel-codings","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6020.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chuquiraga and Doniophyton","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6612.phy"}]}
