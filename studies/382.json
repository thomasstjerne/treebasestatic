Exemplar outgroup taxa were Collembola (1\nsequence), Archaeognatha (1), Ephemerida (1), Odonata (2), Plecoptera\n(2), Blattodea (1), Mantodea (1), Dermaptera (1), Orthoptera (1),\nPhasmatodea (1), Embioptera (1), Psocoptera (1), Phthiraptera (1),\nHemiptera (4), and Thysanoptera (1). Exemplar ingroup taxa were\nColeoptera: Archostemata (1), Adephaga (2), and Polyphaga (7);\nMegaloptera (1); Raphidioptera (1); Neuroptera (sensu stricto ;eq\nPlanipennia): Mantispoidea (2), Hemerobioidea (2), and Myrmeleontoidea\n(2); Hymenoptera: Symphyta (4) and Apocrita (19); Trichoptera:\nHydropsychoidea (1) and Limnephiloidea (2); Lepidoptera: Ditrysia (3);\nSiphonaptera: Pulicoidea (1) and Ceratophylloidea (2); Mecoptera:\nMeropeidae (1), Boreidae (1), Panorpidae (1), and Bittacidae (2);\nDiptera: Nematocera (1), Brachycera (2), and Cyclorrhapha (1); and\nStrepsiptera: Corioxenidae (1), Myrmecolacidae (1), Elenchidae (1), and\nStylopidae (3). We analyzed ~1 kilobase of 18S rDNA, starting 398\nnucleotides downstream of the 5 end, and ~400 bp of 28S rDNA in\nexpansion segment D3. Multiple alignment of the 18S and 28S sequences\nresulted in 1,116 nucleotide positions with 24 insert regions and 398\npositions with 14 insert regions, respectively. All Strepsiptera and\nNeuroptera have large insert regions in 18S and 28S. The secondary\nstructure of 18S insert 23 is composed of long stems that are GC rich in\nthe basal Strepsiptera and AT rich in the more derived Strepsiptera. A\nmatrix of 176 morphological characters was analyzed for holometabolous\norders. Incongruence length difference tests indicate that the 28S +\nmorphological data sets are incongruent but that 28S + 18S, 18S +\nmorphology, and 28S + 18S + morphology fail to reject the hypothesis of\ncongruence. Phylogenetic trees were generated by parsimony analysis, and\nclade robustness was evaluated by branch length, Bremer support,\npercentage of extra steps required to force paraphyly, and sensitivity\nanalysis using the following parameters: gap weights, morphological\ncharacter weights, methods of data set combination, removal of key taxa,\nand alignment region. The following are monophyletic under most or all\ncombinations of parameter values: Holometabola, Polyphaga, Megaloptera +\nRaphidioptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Trichoptera, Lepidoptera,\nAmphiesmenoptera (Trichoptera + Lepidoptera), Siphonaptera, Siphonaptera\n+ Mecoptera, Strepsiptera, Diptera, and Strepsiptera + Diptera\n(Halteria). Antliophora (Mecoptera + Diptera + Siphonaptera +\nStrepsiptera), Mecopterida (Antliophora + Amphiesmenoptera), and\nHymenoptera + Mecopterida are supported in the majority of total\nevidence analyses. Mecoptera may be paraphyletic because Boreus is often\nplaced as sister group to the fleas; hence, Siphonaptera may be\nsubordinate within Mecoptera. The 18S sequences for Priacma (Coleoptera:\nArchostemata), Colpocaccus (Coleoptera: Adephaga), Agulla\n(Raphidioptera), and Corydalus (Megaloptera) are nearly identical, and\nNeuropterida are monophyletic only when those two beetle sequences are\nremoved from the analysis. Coleoptera are therefore paraphyletic under\nalmost all combinations of parameter values. Halteria and\nAmphiesmenoptera have high Bremer support values and long branch\nlengths. The data do not support placement of Strepsiptera outside of\nHolometabola nor as sister group to Coleoptera. We reject the notion\nthat the monophyly of Halteria is due to long branch attraction because\nStrepsiptera and Diptera do not have the longest branches and there is\nphylogenetic congruence between molecules, across the entire parameter\nspace, and between morphological and molecular data.
