Bluecrop in New Jersey, USA. The\nconnection between the anamorph and the teleomorph was confirmed through\nisolations made from single ascospores. The fungus was characterized in\nterms of morphology of the teleomorph on the host, the anamorph in pure\nculture, and sequences of the ITS1/ITS2 regions of the ribosomal DNA\noperon. Morphologically the fungus compared well with the protologue of\nB. corticis. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the isolates from New\nJersey reside in a clade together with isolates of the same species from\nNorth Carolina and this clade is sister to B. dothidea. The specimen\nfrom New Jersey is designated as epitype.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_926.phy"}]}
