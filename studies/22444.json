This\nspecies is characterized by umbonate pileus, greenish olivaceous to\nalmost blackish pileus surface with fibrils, association with\nwarm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved tree, and fruiting in late autumn\nto early winter. Phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) region of fungal ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) showed that new species\nis the sister species of T. portentosum, but morphologically distinct\neach other. Other similar species, T. sejunctum and T. viridilutescens\nare morphologically, ecologically, and phylogenetically distinct from T.\nolivaceonigrum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110567.phy"}]}
