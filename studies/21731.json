Included in this group are the\nspecies Phyllosticta capitalensis, a group of fungi that include\nsaprobes that produce bioactive metabolites. The present study aimed to\nidentify the cultivable endophytic fungal microbiota present in healthy\nleaves of Tibouchina granulosa (Desr.) Cogn. (Melastomataceae) and\ninvestigate secondary metabolites produced by a strain of P.\ncapitalensis and their effects against both Leishmania species and\nTrypanossoma cruzi. Identification of the strains was accomplished\nthrough multilocus sequencing analysis (MLSA), followed by phylogenetic\nanalysis. The frequency of colonization was 73.66% and identified fungi\nbelonged to the genus Diaporthe, Colletotrichum, Phyllosticta, Xylaria,\nHypoxylon, Fusarium, Nigrospora, and Cercospora. A total of 18 compounds\nwere identified by high-resolution mass spectrum analysis (UHPLC-HRMS),\nincluding fatty acids based on linoleic acid and derivatives, from P.\ncapitalensis. Crude extracts had activity against Leishmania\namazonensis, L. infantum, and Trypanosoma cruzi, with inhibitory\nconcentration (IC50) values of 17.2 μg/mL, 82.0 μg/mL, and 50.13 μg/mL,\nrespectively. This is the first report of the production of these\ncompounds by the endophytic P. capitalensis isolated from T.\ngranulosa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107563","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107563.phy"}]}
