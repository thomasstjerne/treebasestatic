This represents a\nnew record of the genus for Antarctica. The distinctive photobiont\narrangement places it within the genus Myriospora (formerly known as the\n“Acarospora” smaragdula group, or Silobia). Characterized by having\nlarge, distinctly elevated, sessile apothecia with a prominent margin,\nand thallus which is usually lobed at the margins and variously\norange-red, rust-coloured or brown-pigmented. It is sister to M.\nscabrida and, when rust coloured, resembles M. dilatata; both species\ndiffer in having usually immersed apothecia. Within the South Orkney\nIslands, the adjacent Coronation Island, with a similar lithology,\nnotably oceanic elements of the Scotia Metamorphic Complex, is most\nlikely to yield further localities for this currently rare, though\neasily overlooked endemic species. A world-wide key to the 10 species\ncurrently recognized in the genus is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103978","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103978.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103979","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103979.phy"}]}
