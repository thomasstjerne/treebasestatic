Closely related portunid subfamilies Caphyrinae and\nThalamitinae constitute some of this groups greatest morphological and\ntaxonomic diversity, and are the only known lineages to include\nsymbiotic taxa. Emergence of symbiosis in decapods remains poorly\nstudied and portunoid crabs provide an interesting, but often overlooked\nexample. Yet the paucity of molecular phylogenetic data available for\nPortunoidea makes it challenging to investigate the evolution and\nsystematics of the group. Phylogenetic analyses, though limited, suggest\nthat many putative portunoid taxa are para- or polyphyletic. Here I\naugment existing molecular datasignificantly increasing taxon sampling\nof Caphyrinae, Thalamitinae, and several disparate portunoid lineagesto\ninvestigate the phylogenetic origin of symbiosis within Portunoidea and\nreevaluate higher- and lower-level portunoid classifications.\nPhylogenetic analyses were carried out on sequences of H3, 28S rRNA, 16S\nrRNA, and CO1 for up to 168 portunoid taxa; this included, for the first\ntime, molecular data from the genera Atoportunus, Brusinia, Caphyra,\nCoelocarcinus, Gonioinfradens, Raymanninus, and Thalamonyx. Results\nsupport the placement of all symbiotic taxa (Caphyra, Lissocarcinus, and\ntwo Thalamita) in a single clade derived within the thalamitine genus\nThalamita. Caphyrina Paulson, 1875, nom. trans. is recognized here as a\nsubtribe within the subfamily Thalamitinae. Results also support the\nfollowing taxonomic actions: Cronius is reclassified as a thalamitine\ngenus; Thalamonyx is reestablished as a valid genus; Goniosupradens is\nraised to the generic rank; and three new genera (Zygita gen. nov.,\nThranita gen. nov., and Trierarchus gen. nov.) are described to\naccommodate some Thalamita s.l. taxa rendered paraphyletic by Caphyrina.\nA new diagnosis of Thalamitinae is provided. Results also support a more\nconservative classification of Portunoidea comprising three instead of\neight extant families: Geryonidae (Geryonidae + Ovalipidae; new\ndiagnosis provided), Carcinidae (Carcinidae + Pirimelidae + Polybiidae +\nThiidae + Coelocarcinus; new diagnosis provided) and Portunidae.\nFinally, 16s rRNA data suggests that family Brusiniidae might not be a\nportunoid lineage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CO1-only best ML topology","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106678","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106678.phy"},{"tree_label":"CO1-only Best ML topology with bipartition support","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106679","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106679.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S-only Best ML topology with bipartition support","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106681","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106681.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S-only best ML topology","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106680","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106680.phy"},{"tree_label":"174_taxa_concatenated Best ML topology with bipartition\nsupport","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106687","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106687.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S-only Best ML topology with bipartition support","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106677","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106677.phy"},{"tree_label":"163_taxa_concatenated Best ML topology with bipartition\nsupport","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106690","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106690.phy"},{"tree_label":"138_taxa_concatenated Best ML topology with bipartition\nsupport","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106684","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106684.phy"},{"tree_label":"163_taxa_concatenated MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106689","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106689.phy"},{"tree_label":"138_taxa_concatenated MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106683","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106683.phy"},{"tree_label":"138_taxa_concatenated best ML topology","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106682","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106682.phy"},{"tree_label":"163_taxa_concatenated best ML topology","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106688","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106688.phy"},{"tree_label":"174_taxa_concatenated MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106686","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106686.phy"},{"tree_label":"174_taxa_concatenated best ML topology","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106685","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106685.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S-only best ML topology","ntax":"163","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106676","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106676.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3-only best ML topology","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106674","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106674.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3-only Best ML topology with bipartition support","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106675","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brusinia-16S Best Scoring ML Topology","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106691","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brusinia-16S Best ML topology with bipartition\nsupport","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106692","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106692.phy"}]}
