We reconstructed phylogenetic\nrelationships of Kentropyx based on morphology (pholidosis and\ncoloration) and mitochondrial DNA data (12S and 16S), using maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian methods, and evaluated biogeographic scenarios\nbased on ancestral areas analyses and molecular dating by Bayesian\nmethods. Additionally, we tested the life-history hypothesis that\nspecies of Kentropyx inhabiting open ecosystems (under seasonal\nenvironments) produce larger clutches with smaller eggs and that species\ninhabiting forest ecosystems (under aseasonal conditions) produce\nclutches with fewer and larger eggs, using Stearns\u001a\nphylogenetic-subtraction method and canonical phylogenetic ordination to\ntake in to account the effects of phylogeny. Our results showed that\nKentropyx comprises three monophyletic groups, with K. striata occupying\na basal position in opposition to previous suggestions of relationships.\nAdditionally, Bayesian analysis of divergence time showed that Kentropyx\nmay have originated at the Tertiary (Eocene/Oligocene) and the\n\u001aPleistocene Refuge Hypothesis\u001a may not explain the species\ndiversification. Based on ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating,\nwe argued that a savanna ancestor is more likely and that historical\nevents during the Tertiary of South America promoted the differentiation\nof the genus, coupled with recent Quaternary events that were important\nas dispersion routes and for the diversification at populational levels.\nClutch size and egg volume were not significantly different between\nmajor clades and ecosystems of occurrence, even accounting for the\nphylogenetic effects. Finally, we argue that phylogenetic constraints\nand phylogenetic inertia might be playing essential roles in life\nhistory evolution of Kentropyx.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5427.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5428.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5429.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5430.phy"},{"tree_label":"12s parsimony","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5421.phy"},{"tree_label":"12s Bayesian","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5422.phy"},{"tree_label":"16s parsimony","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5423.phy"},{"tree_label":"16s Bayesian","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5425.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kentropyx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5426.phy"}]}
