All specimens are conducted by\ncritical morphological examination and molecular phylogenetic analysis\nbased on ITS, LSU and tef-1ï¡ sequences using Bayesian and Maximum\nLikelihood methods. Twelve specie are recognized in this research, and\neleven of which are reported as the new species, one are new records\nfrom China, and five specimens are unnamed because of the lacking of\nsome morphological information. All proposed new species are described\nin details along with the colored plates. The phylogenetic of this\nsection have been improved based on multilocus sequences and extensive\nsamplings especially the type species. The phylogenetic topology from\nthis study shows section Xanthodermatei composed of three lineages\n(named as XanI, II and III), which is similar to the previous research.\nHowever, clade XanII did not get supporting in mathematical statistics\nin both 3-genes and ITS sequences analysis; and clade XanI is loosely\nrelated with other Xanthodermatei clades. So we proposed the strong\nsupported clade XanII+III (In both 3-genes and ITS analysis) is a core\nclade of this section.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86043.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86044.phy"}]}
