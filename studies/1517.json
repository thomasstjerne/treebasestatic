DNA sequence and morphological analyses reveal that two species\noccur sympatrically in the central dry zone of Myanmar. These two\nspecies are described herein. Additionally, the molecular data\ndemonstrate that Calotes versicolor represents multiple species and at\nleast two clades: an India-Myanmar and a Myanmar-Southeast Asian one.\nThe morphological investigation does not currently recognize unique\ntrait(s) for each clade, but it does establish a set of morphometric,\nscalation, and quantitative coloration traits that permit statistical\ncomparison of intra- and interpopulational variation in the versicolor\nspecies group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs 2 and 3","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Draconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2411.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Draconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2410.phy"}]}
