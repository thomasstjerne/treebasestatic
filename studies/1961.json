Members of this order\nexhibit the greatest variation in anatomy, biology, and life history in\nHexacorallia, and lack any morphological synapomorphy. Nonetheless,\nprevious molecular phylogenetic studies have found that Actiniaria is\nmonophyletic with respect to other extant hexacorallians. However,\nrelationships within Actiniaria have remained unresolved, as none of\nthese earlier works have included sufficient taxon sampling to estimate\nrelationships within Actiniaria. We have analyzed sequences from two\nmitochondrial and two nuclear markers for representatives of\napproximately half of the family-level diversity within the order, and\npresent the first phylogenetic tree for Actiniaria. We concur with\nprevious studies that have suggested that molecular evolution is\nunusually slow in this group. We determine that taxonomic groups based\non the absence of features tend not to be recovered as monophyletic, but\nthat at least some classical anatomical featured define monophyletic\ngroups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MP Con","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sea Anemones","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2929.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML Tree","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sea Anemones","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2930.phy"}]}
