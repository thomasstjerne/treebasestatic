A survey of Agaricus species carried\nout around the Ebinur Lake, in Xinjiang Province of China in 2012\nyielded 19 collections that exhibited a red discoloration when bruised.\nMorphological and phylogenetic comparison with species of five sections\nof Agaricus possessing the red discoloration trait showed that the\nspecimens belonged to four species. Two species, A. sinodeliciosus sp.\nnov. and A. bitorquis in section Bivelares and Agaricus desjardinii sp.\nnov. and A. padanus in section Nigrobrunnescentes, both sections being\nmonophyletic. The new species are introduced with descriptions and\nillustrations and all species are compared with similar taxa or previous\nrecords. Agaricus padanus is reported outside Italy for the first time.\nAll those four speceis are edible species consumed by locals, and appear\nto be adapted to relatively dry, cold and sandy habitats. Like A.\nbitorquis, A. sinodeliciosus produces large, delicious semihypogeous\nbasidiomata in such conditions; it is therefore a good potential\ncandidate for cultivation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78368","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78368.phy"}]}
