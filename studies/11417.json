Furthermore, earlier\nstudies did not include representatives from all taxonomic classes. We\nused a five-gene (nuclear encoded SSU rRNA; plastid encoded rbcL, psaA,\npsbA, psbC) analysis with a subset of 89 taxa representing all 16\nheterokont classes to infer a phylogenetic tree. There were three major\nclades. The Aurearenophyceae, Chrysomerophyceae, Phaeophyceae,\nPhaeothamniophyceae, Raphidophyceae, Schizocladiophyceae and\nXanthophyceae formed the SI clade. The Chrysophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae,\nPinguiophyceae, Synchromophyceae and Synurophyceae formed the SII clade.\nThe Bacillariophyceae, Bolidophyceae, Dictyochophyceae and Pelagophyceae\nformed the SIII clade. These three clades were also found in a ten-gene\nanalysis. The approximately unbiased test rejected alternative\nhypotheses that forced each class into either of the other two clades.\nMorphological and biochemical data were not available for all 89 taxa,\nhowever, existing data were consistent with the molecular phylogenetic\ntree, especially for the SIII clade","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Photosynthetic Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44907.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Photosynthetic Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44906.phy"}]}
