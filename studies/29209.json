It is also a key\npollinator of a wide variety of important agricultural crops. No genomic\ninformation is currently available for S. rueppellii. Without genomic\ninformation for such beneficial predator species, we are unable to\nperform comparative analyses of insecticide target-sites and genes\nencoding metabolic enzymes potentially responsible for insecticide\nresistance, between crop pests and their predators. These metabolic\nmechanisms include several gene families - cytochrome P450\nmonooxygenases (P450s), ATP binding cassette transporters (ABCs),\nglutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) and\ncarboxyl/choline esterases (CCEs).Â ","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135007.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135078.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135079.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135069.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135077.phy"}]}
