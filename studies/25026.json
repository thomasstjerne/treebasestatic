Only eleven collections are known worldwide. We\npresent a molecular phylogenetic tree based on mtSSU and nrITS sequence\ndata from six Aciculopsora specimens. Our results corroborate the\nmonophyly of the genus. We conclude that Aciculopsora consists of three\nspecies: A. cinerea, A. longispora comb. nov. (â‰¡ Phyllopsora longispora,\n= A. salmonea syn. nov.) and A. srilankensis sp. nov. Aciculopsora\ncinerea occurs in Brazil, A. longispora in Argentina, Costa Rica,\nEcuador, and Kenya, and A. srilankensis in Sri Lanka. As such, the genus\nis new for the Paleotropics, Argentina and Ecuador.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128194","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128194.phy"}]}
