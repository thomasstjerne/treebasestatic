The geological history of this\nregion is considered an important factor in explaining the evolutionary\nhistory of low vagility animals like freshwaters fishes. The aim of this\nstudy was to examine the phylogenetic relationships and describe the\nevolutionary history of the species-group. We hypothesized that the\ngenetic structure and distribution of the main clades of Pantosteus\nplebeius-nebuliferus are associated with the geological history of\nNorthern Mexico. To this end, we obtained DNA sequences of mitochondrial\nand nuclear genes and performed phylogenetic and phylogeographic\nanalyses. Divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction\nwere also carried out to propose a biogeographical hypothesis, and\nspecies boundaries within the species-group were also tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"cytb tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114689.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GHI tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114690.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"cytb GHI tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114691.phy"}]}
