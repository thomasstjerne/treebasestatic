In a\nphylogenetic inferences based on a DNA sequence data set of 4 loci (5’\nend of the LSU, ITS-5.8S, partial Tef-1 and rpb2), this species has an\nisolated position, basal to a clade composed otherwise, and so far\nexclusively, of species with resupinate basidiomata and occurring in the\nNeotropical areas. The multiloci phylogenetic inferences evidenced also\nan unreported complexity within the Neotropical area, with multiple\nclades in the vicinity of F. apiahyna or F. texana, representing\npotential species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"50% majority-rule consensus tree from Bayesian\ninference of the combined ITS, LSU, tef1 and rpb2 sequences including\nthe recoded indels.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53705.phy"}]}
