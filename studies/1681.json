Many of the A. ostoyae genets contained heterogeneity\namong rDNA repeats, indicating intragenomic variation and likely\nintraspecific hybridization. Intragenomic variation was verified by\nvisually editing base-sequence offsets in regions with\ninsertions/deletions, and using sequence-specific internal primers to\nresequence heterogeneous regions. Phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian\nInference methods were used to define groups within A. ostoyae. Analysis\nof A. ostoyae from outside the western USA indicated the presence of a\nCircumboreal group of A. ostoyae that also occurs in Utah; two other\nphylogeographic groups were associated with the Rocky Mountain and\nPacific Northwest regions of the USA. Mixed sequence types, an\nindication of intraspecific hybrids, were common in some geographic\nregions. Hybridization events may have influenced species evolution,\ncontributing to variation in pathogenicity and virulence. The occurrence\nof these groups and intraspecific hybrids also indicates that\npaleogeography and paleoclimate may have influenced the phylogeography\nof A. ostoyae. In addition, other Armillaria species were examined for\nevolutionary relationships with the groups of A. ostoyae. These findings\nwill provide a basis for future research relating ecological function to\ngenetic diversity within A. ostoyae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western U.S. Armillaria ostoyae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western U.S. Armillaria ostoyae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western U.S. Armillaria ostoyae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4691.phy"}]}
