Our results confirm those from\nearlier anatomical and single-gene (rbcL) studies that suggested Osmunda\ns.l. was paraphyletic. Osmunda cinnamomea is sister to the remainder of\nOsmundaceae (Leptopteris, Todea, and Osmunda s.s.). We support the\nrecognition of a monotypic fourth genus, Osmundastrum, to accommodate\nthese results. We also resolve subgeneric relationships within Osmunda\ns.s. and find that subg. Claytosmunda is strongly supported as sister to\nthe rest of Osmunda. A stable, well-supported classification for extant\nOsmundaceae is proposed, along with a key to all genera and\nsubgenera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmundaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2886.phy"}]}
