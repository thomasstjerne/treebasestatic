We surveyed remaining\nP. amamiana forests and found some sporocarps of Rhizopogon (Boletales),\nmany species of which exhibit strict host specificity to a narrow range\nof Pinaceae trees and play critical roles in host establishment. Based\non morphological characteristics and molecular phylogeny, here we\ndescribe Rhizopogon yakushimensis sp. nov. This new species belongs to a\nnew clade, phylogenetically related to the subgenera Versicolores and\nRhizopogon. We also confirmed its ectomycorrhizal association with P.\namamiana by comparing rDNA ITS sequences between the sporocarps and\nectomycorrhizal root tips.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopogon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108570.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopogon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108569.phy"}]}
