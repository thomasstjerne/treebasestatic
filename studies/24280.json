The most common and\nabundant species that appeared regularly on the Portuguese coast were P.\nterrigenum and P. brevicompactum. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS and\npartial b-tubulin genes placed one isolate into Penicillium section\nRamosa, distinct from all currently known species and closely related to\nP. tunisiense. Penicillium lusitanicus sp. nov. are proposed here as\nnovel species and we provide detailed descriptions of the morphological\ncharacteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium from marine environments","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119796.phy"}]}
