Hyphoderma tenuissimum is characterized by\nresupinate basidiomata with tuberculate to minutely-grandinioid hymenial\nsurface, presence of septate cystidia and cylindrical to allantoid\nbasidiospores. Sequences of ITS+28S nrRNA gene regions of the studied\nsamples were generated and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods.\nThese phylogenetic showed that the two new species clustered into\nHyphoderma, in which H. puerense grouped with H. moniliforme, and H.\ntenuissimum was sister to H. mopanshanense.","trees":[{"tree_label":"brlen","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135413.phy"},{"tree_label":"boot","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135412.phy"}]}
