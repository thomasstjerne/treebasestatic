In this study,\nthe GRV allantoic fluid was concentrated and used as an antigen in a\nformalin-inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine. Results: When 6 day-old geese\nwere inoculated, antibodies against GRV became detectable at 6 days\npost-vaccination, their concentration peaked at 3 weeks. These\nantibodies were maintained for longer than 2 weeks. As the most\nsusceptible age for GRV infection is birds under 2 weeks of age this\nvaccine should provide adequate cover for the most at risk birds. When\ngeese were exposed to reovirus at different time intervals after\nimmunization, the data revealed that the vaccine can provide a\nprotection rate of 80%. The developed vaccine has good stability and\ncould be stored at 4Â°C for at least 12 months. Conclusion: These results\nindicate that the developed GRV vaccine is safe, effectively absorbed,\nefficacious in inducing a rapid immune response, and effective in\ncontrolling GRV infection. Our results should be useful for the\napplication of vaccines for controlling GRV in different goose\nflocks.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Avian reovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107776.phy"}]}
