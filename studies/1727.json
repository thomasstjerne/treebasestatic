These species are placed in four genera with disjunct\ngeographic distributions; Anisophyllea has 25-30 species in South\nAmerica, Africa, and Malesia; Combretocarpus has one species in Sumatra\nand Borneo; Poga one species in equatorial Africa; and Polygonanthus two\nin the Amazon Basin. Here we use a phylogeny based on six nuclear and\nplastid loci sequenced for 15 species representing the four genera to\ninfer their relationships and the relative and absolute ages of the\nrange disjunctions. Combretocarpus is sister to the other three genera,\nand Polygonanthus then sister to Poga and Anisophyllea. Ansiophyllea,\nrepresented by 12 species from all three continents, is monophyletic. A\nrelaxed Bayesian clock calibrated with the oldest fossils from a\nrelevant outgroup, Tetramelaceae, suggests that the disjunctions between\nCombretocarpus, Poga, and Polygonanthus date back to the Cretaceous,\nwhereas the intercontinental disjunctions within Anisophyllea appear to\ndate back only some 22-23 million years and thus probably result from\nlong-distance dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict ITS-Aniso","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS-Aniso","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_508.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.
