Both form ascomata on living\nphylloclades with minimal disruption of the phylloclade tissue. Fungal\nhyphae within the phylloclade are primarily intercellular. Guignardia\nkorthalsellae disrupts a limited number of epidermal cells immediately\naround the erumpent ascoma, while the ascomata of Rosenscheldiella\nkorthalsellae develop externally on small patches of stromatic tissue\nthat form above stomatal cavities. Rosenscheldiella is applied in a\npurely morphological sense. LSU sequences show that R. korthalsellae, as\nwell as another New Zealand species, Rosenscheldiella brachyglottidis,\nare members of the Mycosphaerellaceae sensu stricto. Genetically,\nRosenscheldiella in the sense we are using it is polyphyletic, LSU and\nITS sequences placing the two New Zealand species in different clades\nwithin the Mycosphaerellaceae. Rosenscheldiella is retained for these\nfungi until generic relationships within the family are resolved.\nWhether or not the type species of Rosenscheldiella, R. styracis, is\nalso a member of the Mycosphaerellaceae is not known, but it has a\nsimilar morphology and relationship to its host as the two New Zealand\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 7","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9819.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 6","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9820.phy"}]}
