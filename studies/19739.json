The genus Eichleriella is reinstated to embrace ten closely\nrelated species with ellipsoid-ovoid basidia, and E. leucophaea is\ndesignated here as the genus type. Eichleriella bactriana, E. desertorum\nand E. sicca are described as new to science. In addition, four species\nearlier treated as members of Exidiopsis or Heterochaete are combined to\nthe genus. The genus name Heteroradulum (type Radulum kmetii) is\nvalidated for seven species with large, obconical, stipitate basidia. Of\nthem, H. adnatum and H. semis are described as new. Two new genera,\nAmphistereum (with two species, type Eichleriella schrenkii) and\nSclerotrema (monotypic, type Exidiopsis griseobrunnea), are introduced;\nHirneolina (monotypic, type H. hirneoloides) and Tremellochaete (with\ntwo species, type Exidia japonica) are restored as good genera. The type\nspecies of Heterochaete, H. andina, is congeneric with Exidiopsis (type\nE. effusa).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98032.phy"}]}
