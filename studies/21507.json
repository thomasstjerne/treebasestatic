Its taxonomic subdivision has troubled\npteridologists for more than one century. Recent molecular analyses have\nrevealed four monophyletic groups (Alsophila, Cyathea, Gymnosphaera, and\nSphaeropteris) within this family. However, one of the four groups,\nGymnosphaera, was still submerged in Alsophila in a modern\nclassification proposed by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group due to\nGymnosphaera was phylogenetically underrepresented in previous studies.\nIn this study we add the sampling of Gymnosphaera from its main\ndistribution area (SE Asia) and conduct phylogenetic analyses of\ndatasets containing individual and combined five cpDNA regions (rbcL,\nrbcL-accD, rbcL-atpB, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF) of 121 scaly tree ferns\nusing three methods (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian\ninference). The result is congruent with previous studies, consistently\nresolving scaly tree ferns as four well-supported clades with\nSphaeropteris sister to the other three, and shows a probability for the\nfirst time on the relationships between Alsophila, Cyathea, and\nGymnosphaera, i.e., Alsophila is sister to Gymnosphaera and then\ntogether as sister to Cyathea. As well supported to be distinct from\nAlsophila in molecular phylogeny, in morphology, and in sporogenetic\nmechanism, Gymnosphaera is reinstated here, with a minor emendation in\ncircumscription, as a separate genus. To facilitate the application of\nspeciesÂ’ names and future revision, we provide a checklist of 45 taxa now\nknown in Gymnosphaera with information of nomenclatural types and\ngeneral distributions; among them 24 are new combinations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyatheaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109579.phy"}]}
