An ongoing\nsurvey of macrofungi in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, has produced four\ncollections of Mycocitrus aurantium Möller. This species is considered\nrare and few records of it are found in the literature. The goals of\nthis work are to improve the morphological knowledge of the species,\ncommunicate the first culture since the finding of M. aurantium and\ndiscuss its phylogenetic position. Morphological and phylogenetic\nstudies were carried out on fresh specimens and cultures. A phylogeny\nwas constructed based on sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer. Currently, Mycocitrus is placed in the\nBionectriaceae (Hypocreales); however, its placement at the family level\nis unclear when considering morphological characters alone.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycocitrus aurantium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109583.phy"}]}
