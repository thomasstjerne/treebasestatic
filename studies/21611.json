Multigene phylogenetic analyses using the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2)\nand partial translation elongation factor 1-Î± (EF1), identified F.\noxysporum and F. avenaceum as the most frequently isolated species\nassociated with root and crown diseases of pyrethrum, and F. equiseti\nand F. venenatum at a low incidence. Pathogenicity trials confirmed that\nF. oxysporum and F. avenaceum significantly affected growth of pyrethrum\nplants causing Fusarium crown rot, however; F. avenaceum was less\npathogenic than F. oxysporum. Fusarium oxysporum and F. avenaceum may be\npart of a complex of pathogens that are involved in pyrethrum\nyield-decline.","trees":[{"tree_label":"thetree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium avenaceum\nITS-tef1-RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107232.phy"}]}
