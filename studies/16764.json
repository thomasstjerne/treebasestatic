Although recent\nphylogenetic analyses have indicated the possible polyphyly of\naplanozygotes identified as C. nivalis, the analytical resolution was\nnot robust, possibly because only single genes were analysed. Here, we\nobtained long sequences of multiple DNA regions from 50 identical [on\nthe basis of light microscopy (LM)] aplanozygotes in a field-collected\nsample, and the phylogenetic positions of these aplanozygotes\n(identified as C. brevispina and C. nivalis on the basis of LM) were\ndetermined with high statistical support using a multigene phylogeny.\nComparisons of the present and previously published sequence data\nindicated that aplanozygotes of C. nivalis originating from Japan and\nAustria represented at least four different lineages, all of which were\nrobustly separated from the North American strain CU563D of C. nivalis.\nMolecular analyses including the comparison of highly evolving nuclear\nribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 demonstrated that one\nJapanese lineage of C. nivalis aplanozygotes was conspecific with C.\nmiwae strains. In addition, the present C. brevispina aplanozygote\nspecimens from Japan were assigned to C. krienitzii sp. nov., which was\nherein delineated on the basis of LM and electron microscopy and the\nmolecular phylogeny of newly established strains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S13","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas BI tree of 18S rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80925.phy"},{"tree_label":"not used","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas NJT of ITS2 of group A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80927.phy"},{"tree_label":"not used","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas NJT of ITS2 of grou B","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80928.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S14","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas BI tree of rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas BI tree of 3 genes (1st, 2nd codons\nonly)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S12","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chloromonas BIT 3 genes (all codon positions)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88962.phy"}]}
