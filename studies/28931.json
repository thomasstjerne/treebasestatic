The main\ndistinguishing characteristics of Asproinocybe sinensis are the central\nof pileus dark brown; with larger basidia (33 × 10 µm); cheilocystidia\n(30-40 × 8-10 µm) and pleurocystidia (38 × 9 µm) present and the apex\nunbranched; hyphae of pileipellis with finely incrustation.\nTricholosporum guangxiense characterized by the basidiomata medium in\nsized, pileus no color-spots, central with obvious yellowish-brownish\ncolor at mature; cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia unfurcate and\nsometimes with purplish pigment; spores cyanophilous, not exceeding 7\nµm, 5.4 × 4.7 µm. The phylogenetic analyses based on ITS+LSU and six\ngenes (ITS, nrLSU, RPB1, RPB2, nrSSU, TEF1-α) using Bayesian (BA) and\nMaximum Likelihood (ML) methods showed that the two new taxons can be\ndistinguished from phenotypically similar and phylogenetically related\nspecies and form an independent family clade (BPP=0.98, BS=72).\nAsproinocybaceae fam. nov., a new family is established here for\naccommodating the Asproinocybe/Tricholosporum clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134259.phy"}]}
