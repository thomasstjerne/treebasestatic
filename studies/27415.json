Type material or authentic specimens of 74 relatively\npoorly-studied genera belonging to five orders classified under\nDiaporthomycetidae and Sordariomycetidae were re-examined. Descriptions,\nnotes, figures and drawings are provided and their phylogenetic\npositions are re-defined based on morphology, where possible backed up\nwith multi-gene analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthomycetidae and Sordariomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131237.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131238.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131239.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boliniales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131240.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helminthosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131241.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131242.phy"}]}
