Although the pathogenicity of this species was established\nin a previous study, the fungus has never been formally described.\nMorphologically this species is easily distinguished from others in the\ngenus based on its large, chiefly 1-septate alpha conidia. Although this\nis an unusual feature for Phomopsis, ITS DNA sequence data indicate,\nhowever, that this taxon is best accommodated in Phomopsis. This finding\nalso suggests that the generic concept of Phomopsis should be expanded\nto include taxa with 1-septate alpha conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5615.phy"}]}
