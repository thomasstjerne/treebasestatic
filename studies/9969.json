Phylogenetic analysis\nof molecular and morphological data resolved V. cambodiana within a\nstrongly supported clade of Nymphoides species. In retrospect, we also\nfind that the morphological characteristics of this taxon are more\nconsistent with those of Nymphoides than of Villarsia. Thus we recommend\nthe transfer of V. cambodiana to Nymphoides and provide the appropriate\nnew taxonomic combination Nymphoides cambodiana (Hance) Tippery.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Menyanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6561.phy"}]}
