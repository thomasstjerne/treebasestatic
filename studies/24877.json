It has recently gained increasing attention because\nof its economic value. In this study, we obtained the complete\nchloroplast genome of A. lappa by Illumina Hiseq. The complete\nchloroplast genome of A. lappa is a typical circular structure with\n152,708 bp in length. The GC content in the whole chloroplast genome of\nA. lappa is 37.7%. A total of 37 tRNA genes, 8 rRNA genes and 87\nprotein-coding genes were successfully annotated. And the chloroplast\ngenome contains 113 unique genes, 19 of which are duplicated in the\ninverted repeat. The distribution of 39 simple sequence repeats was\nanalysed, and most of them are located in the large single-copy (LSC)\nsequence. An inversion comprising 16 genes was found in the LSC region,\nwhich is 26,283 bp long. We performed multiple sequence alignments using\n72 common protein-coding genes of 29 species and constructed the Maximum\nParsimony (MP) tree. The MP phylogenetic result shows that A. lappa\ngrouped together with Carthamus tinctorius, Centaurea diffusa and\nSaussurea involucrate. The chloroplast genome of A. lappa can provide\nsolid foundation for species identification, molecular breeding and\nphylogenetic relationship of Asteraceae species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119268.phy"}]}
