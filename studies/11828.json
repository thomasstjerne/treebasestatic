Due to considerable morphological variation,\nputative hybridization, polyploidy (including aneuploidy), and apomixis,\ncircumscription of, and relationships among taxa have been uncertain.\nWith a goal of estimating the organismal phylogeny, two non-coding DNA\nregions, ITS and trnT-L-F representing the nuclear and chloroplast\ngenomes, respectively, were sequenced and subjected to maximum\nlikelihood and parsimony analyses. Character state reconstruction\nanalysis was carried out to examine the main morphological characters\nused in species circumscription. Nuclear and chloroplast data provided a\nsimilar general phylogenetic pattern, albeit with a lower level of\nresolution from the trnT-L-F sequences. Results support monophyly of the\nBouteloua curtipendula complex, but not the monophyly of its taxa,\nexcept for B. triaena, which forms a strongly supported clade in both\nphylogenies. The origin of the Bouteloua curtipendula complex seems to\nbe recent, so the taxa show low divergence. The main morphological\ntaxonomic characters used to circumscribe species were all found to be\nhomoplasious.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bouteloua curtipendula Complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47933.phy"}]}
