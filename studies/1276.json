Despite the\nimportance of this subgenus, phylogenetic relationships among these taxa\nare currently unclear. The present research contributes to this\nunderstanding while focusing on Solanum section Acanthophora, a group of\nca. 19 species defined by the presence of simple hairs, rather than the\nstellate hairs common across the rest of subgenus Leptostemonum. In this\nstudy we inferred phylogenetic relationships among 29 Solanum taxa,\nincluding 14 species of section Acanthophora, using DNA sequence data\nfrom two nuclear regions [ITS and the granule-bound starch synthase gene\n(GBSSI or waxy)] and two chloroplast regions (trnT-trnF and trnS-trnG).\nThis combination of gene regions resulted in a well resolved\nphylogenetic hypothesis, with results strongly suggesting that Solanum\nsect. Acanthophora is not monophyletic, although the majority of taxa\ncomprise a monophyletic lineage that is sister to Solanum section\nLasiocarpa. Of the four gene regions, waxy was especially useful for\nphylogenetic inference, with both a high percentage of\nparsimony-informative sites as well as a low level of homoplasy. Further\nstudies in progress will help elucidate relationships of sect.\nAcanthophora to other members of subgenus Leptostemonum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum, BS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2001.phy"}]}
