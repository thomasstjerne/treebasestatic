Several methods of differential weighting (positional,\ntransformational, and combined) were explored using character congruence\nbetween the linked data sets as an optimality criterion. Most weighting\nschemes gave an increase in congruence as well as phylogenetic signal.\nThe optimal weighting scheme according to the criterion was successive\nweighting of each character (positional weighting) with 1/(number of\nsteps) in combination with LN weighting of character changes\n(transformational weighting). The cladogram from the optimal weighting\nscheme was in general congruent with existing classifications. One\nexception is the genus Goniodoris, which was paraphyletic if Okenia\naspersa was not also included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3704.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Best hypothesis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3705.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S dataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3702.phy"}]}
