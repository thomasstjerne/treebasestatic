Here, we describe a new species of ornithomimosaur, Beishanlong\ngrandis, from an associated, partial postcranial skeleton from the\nAptian-Albian Xinminpu Group of northern Gansu, China. Beishanlong is\nsimilar to another Aptian-Albian ornithomimosaur, Harpymimus, with which\nit shares a phylogenetic position as more derived than the Barremian\nShenzhousaurus and as sister to a Late Cretaceous clade composed of\nGarudimimus and the Ornithomimidae. Beishanlong is one of the largest\ndefinitive ornithomimosaurs yet described, though histological analysis\nshows that the holotype individual was still growing at its death.\nTogether with the co-eval and sympatric therizinosaur Suzhousaurus and\nthe oviraptorosaur Gigantraptor, Beishanlong provides evidence for the\nparallel evolution of gigantism in separate lineages of beaked and\npossibly herbivorous coelurosaurs within a short time span in Central\nAsia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithomimosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55684.phy"}]}
