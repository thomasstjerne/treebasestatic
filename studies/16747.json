Novel nucleotide sequence data from five\ndifferent genes (COI, 16S, 12S, NaK and PEPCK) were collected to\nestimate phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status among all but\none subspecies in this genus. The phylogenetic results only support two\nof the four species groups previously proposed for this genus and\nindicate an evolution direction of the genital organs from simple to\ncomplex. The present results suggest that Parapenaeus originated in the\nshallow waters of the West Pacific with subsequent migration to the deep\nsea and the Atlantic. The molecular data reveal that there was probably\nmisidentification of females between P. australiensis and P.\nruberoculatus, with females previously assigned as P. australiensis\nlikely being the females of P. ruberoculatus while material identified\nas P. australiensis forma nodosa being the true P. australiensis\nfemales. On the other hand, P. longipes forma denticulata truly\nrepresents a variation of the same species while the subspecies P.\nfissuroides indicus warrants a specific rank.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parapenaeus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79976.phy"}]}
