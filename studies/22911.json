It is a saxicolous species morphologically very\nsimilar to O. parella, but differs from the latter phylogenetically and\nchemically in the production of olivetoric acid causing C+ red reaction\nof the apothecial margin medulla. Ochrolechia incarnata is so far known\nfrom Europe (Ireland, Sweden) and Macaronesia (Canary Islands, Porto\nSanto). Notes on other saxicolous species with pruinose apothecia are\nprovided and the taxonomy of O. pallescens is shortly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ochrolechia nuITS using MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112345.phy"}]}
