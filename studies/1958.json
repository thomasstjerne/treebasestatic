A collection\nof isolates identified as L. theobromae was studied on the basis of\nsequence data from the ITS region and EF1-alpha gene. Phylogenetic\nanalyses identified three well-supported clades within this group of\nisolates, one corresponding to L. theobromae and two others\ncorresponding to potential cryptic species. The distinct phylogenetic\nposition of the two clades is supported by differences in conidial\nmorphology and these are, therefore, described as new species,\nLasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae sp. nov. and Lasiodiplodia parva sp.\nnov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2925.phy"}]}
