In the present study, the genome of\nPhialocephala subalpina, the most frequent species of the Phialocephala\nfortinii s.l.  Acephala applanata species complex, was sequenced for\ninsight in the genome structure and gene inventory of these wide-spread\nroot endophytes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAC_03408","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99750","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99750.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_05940","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99751","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99751.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_06755","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99752","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99752.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_07909","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99753","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99753.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_03208","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99747","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99747.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_03208_Fig5","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99748","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99748.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_11525","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99754","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99754.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_12936","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99755","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99755.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_13085","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99756","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99756.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_13705","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99757","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99757.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_14321","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99758","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99758.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_15031","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99759","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99759.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_15362","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99761","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99761.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_16385","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99762","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99762.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_17397","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99763","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99763.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_18364","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99764","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99764.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_18575","ntax":"218","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99765","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99765.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_19296","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99766","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99766.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_19778","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99767","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99767.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_02359","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99746","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99746.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_03301","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99749","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99749.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_15031_Fig5","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99760","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99760.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAC_20157","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99768","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99768.phy"}]}
