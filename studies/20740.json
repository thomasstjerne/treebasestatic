It has been widely used as traditional medicine in Asia since\nit has potential nutritional and therapeutic values. We collected 26\nspecimens of Ganoderma species from Thailand. Eight of the specimens\nrepresent the first record of G. sichuanenese for Thailand. In this\npaper, we describe our specimens of Ganoderma sichuanense based on fresh\nbasidiomes, and provide line drawings and photographs. The data from\nmacro- and microscopic features are consistent with the characteristics\nof the species. Analysis of ITS sequence data indicates that the Thai\ncollections cluster in same species clade as the epitype of G.\nsichuanense","trees":[{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thawthong Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106867.phy"}]}
