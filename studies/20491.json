However,\nspecies level identification is difficult due to poor phylogenetic\nunderstanding and lack of sequenced type species, and only Internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) sequence data are available for the most\nCytospora strains in GenBank. In this study, samples of Cytospora were\ncollected from symptomatic twigs and branches from Russia. Morphological\ncharacters and combined multi-gene phylogenetic analysis (ITS, LSU,\nRPB2, ACT) were used to identify taxa. A total of 34 collections,\nrepresenting 17 fungal species in genus Cytospora were studied in this\nstudy. Of these, 14 new species are described and illustrated. Three\nspecies are known taxa and include C. nivea, C. parasitica, and C.\nsalicicola. Introducued species are C. ampulliformis, C. curvata, C.\ndonetzica, C. erumpens, C. longiostiolata, C. melnikii, C.\nparakantschavelii, C. paratranslucens, C. rusanovii, C. salicacearum, C.\nsalicina, C. sorbi, C. sorbicola and C. ulmi. Descriptions,\nillustrations and notes are provided for the studied taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101749.phy"}]}
