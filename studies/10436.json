The potential\ninfluence of such bias might be mitigated by strategies to reduce\ncompositional heterogeneity in the dataset, or by phylogeny\nreconstruction methods that account for compositional heterogeneity. We\nadopted several of these strategies to analyze a large ribosomal protein\ndataset representing all major metazoan taxa. Posterior predictive tests\nrevealed that there is compositional bias in this dataset. Only a few\ntaxa with strongly deviating amino acid composition had to be excluded\nto reduce this bias. Thus, this is a good solution, if these taxa are\nnot central to the phylogenetic question at hand. Deleting individual\nproteins from the data matrix may be an appropriate method, if\ncompositional heterogeneity among taxa is concentrated in a few\nproteins. However, half of the ribosomal proteins had to be excluded to\nreduce the compositional heterogeneity to a degree that the CAT model\nwas no longer significantly violated. Recoding of amino acids into\ngroups is another alternative, but causes a loss of information and may\nresult in badly resolved trees as demonstrated by the present dataset.\nBayesian inference with the CAT-BP model directly accounts for\ncompositional heterogeneity between lineages by introducing breakpoints\nalong the branches of the phylogeny at which the amino acid composition\nis allowed to change, but is computationally expensive. Finally, a\nneighbor-joining tree based on equal input distances that consider\npattern and rate heterogeneity showed several unusual groupings, which\nare most likely artifacts, probably caused by the loss of information\nresulting from the transformation of the sequence data into distances.\nAs long as no more efficient phylogenetic inference methods are\navailable that can directly account for compositional heterogeneity in\nlarge datasets, using methods for reducing compositional heterogeneity\nin the data in combination with methods that assume a stationary amino\nacid composition remains an option for controlling systematic errors in\ntree reconstruction that result from compositional bias. Our analyses\nindicated that the paraphyly of Deuterostomia in some analyses is the\nresult of systematic errors that also affected the relationships of\nEntoprocta and Ectoprocta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S16","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S11","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S12","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa, Bayesian inference reconstructions based on\n11,544 amino acid positions derived from 78 ribosomal proteins of 48\ntaxa, using the CAT model.","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S6","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25676.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S7","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25677.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S8","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25679.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S10","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S9","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S13","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S15","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa, Bayesian inference reconstructions based on\n11,544 amino acid positions derived from 78 ribosomal proteins of 48\ntaxa, using the CATÂ–BP model, which directly accounts for compositional\nheterogeneity between lineages.","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25691.phy"}]}
