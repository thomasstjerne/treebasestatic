It is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate\nbasidiocarps up to 100 cm long, spines cream when fresh and cinnamon\nwhen dry, up to 3 mm long and a few glued at tips when dry, distinct\nwhite, rhizomorphic to cottony margin, a monomitic hyphal structure with\nnon-amyloid, non-dextrinoid and cyanophilous generative hyphae, the\npresence of gloeoplerous hyphae and gloeocystidia which becoming dark\nblue in Melzers reagent, the presence of chlamydospores in subiculum,\nand rough basidiospores measuring 3.54.5 × 2.43.2 µm. A molecular study\nbased on the combined ITS (internal transcribed spacer region) and nLSU\n(the large nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit) dataset supports the new\nspecies in Dentipellis. A key to accepted species of Dentipellis sensu\nstricto is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dentipellis tasmanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112997.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dentipellis tasmanica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112998.phy"}]}
