In Colombia, miscellaneous plantations were\nestablished during the 1950s, when industrial activities were at their\nheight, and policies to limit deforestation in native Quercus humboldtii\nforests were established. One unforeseen consequence of planting\nnon-native trees was the simultaneous introduction and subsequent\npersistence of fungal symbionts, including ectomycorrhizal fungi in the\ngenus Amanita. We sought to document the origins of the Amanita muscaria\ngrowing in Colombian plantations of the Mexican species Pinus patula,\nNorth American P. taeda, and Australian Acacia melanoxylon and\nEucalyptus globulus. The fungus is now spreading into native Q.\nhumboldtii forests. According to a Bayesian phylogeny and haplotype\nanalysis based on the nuc rDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) region, A. muscaria individuals associated\nwith the four exotic plant species, and those colonizing Q. humboldtii\nforests, are Eurasian in origin, belonging to two Eurasian haplotypes.\nThis is the first time the spread of an introduced mutualist fungus is\nreported into native Q. humboldtii forests of Colombia. We suggest the\nuse of local inocula including native fungi, rather than introduced\nfungi, as a strategy to help decrease the spreading of A. muscaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99469.phy"}]}
