Using 1756 bp\nof mitochondrial DNA sequence consisting of the 12S, ATPase-6, ATPase-8,\nand COI genes obtained from all extant species, we derive a completely\nresolved phylogeny for both groups. The inferred relationships among\nthese species are robust to the method of phylogenetic estimation used,\nand all branches are well supported, in spite of the relatively recent\nradiation within the frigatebirds. The two families are not closely\nrelated either to each other, or to any other putative relatives (e.g.,\npelicans; Pelecanidae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Frigatebirds and Tropicbirds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_220.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Frigatebirds and Tropicbirds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_221.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Frigatebirds and Tropicbirds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_289.phy"}]}
