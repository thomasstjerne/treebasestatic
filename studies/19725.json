Among RLKs, the lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRLKs) possess a\ncharacteristic extracellular carbohydrate-binding lectin domain and play\nimportant roles in plant development and innate immunity. There are 75\nand 173 LecRLKs in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively. However, little\nis known about LecRLKs in the perennial woody plants. Results: Here we\nreport the genome-wide analysis of classification, domain architecture\nand expression of LecRLKs in the perennial woody model plant Populus. We\nfound that the LecRLK family has expanded in Populus to a total of 231,\nincluding 180 G-type, 50 L-type and 1 C-type Populus LecRLKs\n(PtLecRLKs). Expansion of the PtLecRLKs occurred partially through\ntandem duplication. Based on domain architecture and orientation\nfeatures, we classified PtLecRLKs into eight different classes.\nRNA-seq-based transcriptomics analysis revealed diverse expression\npatterns of PtLecRLK genes among leaves, stems, roots, buds and\nreproductive tissues and organs. Conclusions: This study offers a\ncomprehensive view of LecRLKs in the perennial woody model plant Populus\nand provides a foundation for functional characterization of this\nimportant family of receptor-like kinases.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"231","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus lectin receptor-like kinases","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97931.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"188","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus lectin receptor-like kinases","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97932.phy"},{"tree_label":"topology 3","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97936","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97936.phy"},{"tree_label":"topology 2","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97935","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97935.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus lectin receptor-like kinases","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97934.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus lectin receptor-like kinases","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97940.phy"},{"tree_label":"topology 4","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97937","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97937.phy"},{"tree_label":"topology 6","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97939","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97939.phy"},{"tree_label":"topology 5","ntax":"319","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97938","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97938.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Populus lectin receptor-like kinases","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97933.phy"}]}
