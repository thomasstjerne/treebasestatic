Unlike most other species of Hypocrea, the teleomorph of\nH. voglmayri occurs on dry standing trunks and exhibits well-defined\nblack ostioles. Although exclusively collected at high altitudes,\ncultures of this species grow at 35Â°C. They develop pale yellowish to\ngreenish conidia, a yellowish pigment, and a coconut-like odor on CMD.\nPhylogenetically, H. voglmayri forms a distinct, lone branch in the\nvicinity of section Trichoderma and the H. pachybasioides clade, but\ndoes not associate with any of these clades in different gene\ntrees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule b","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea voglmayri","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2284.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule a","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea voglmayri","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2283.phy"}]}
