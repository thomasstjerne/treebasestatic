Rufrobrunnea. The specimens were found in the\nAmazon rain forest of Brazil, growing on soil, among litterfall. This\nnew species is morphologically characterized by its clitocyboid habit,\nreddish orange pileus, close lamellae, fusiform stipe with radicant\nbase, globose to short ellipsoid basidiospores, absence of cystidia and\nby a cutis-like pileipellis. The description is illustrated with\nphotographs and line-drawings of the basidiomata and main microscopic\nfeatures. Molecular data (nrITS) support the recognition of this new\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124322.phy"}]}
