Dieback of plants is the most prominent disease\nobserved in blueberry orchards. This study evaluated the diversity and\npathogenicity of Lasiodiplodia and Neopestalotiopsis species associated\nwith dieback of blueberry plants in Peru. A collection of isolates was\ninitially subjected to Microsatellite-primed PCR (MSP-PCR)\nfingerprinting and further characterised by sequence analyses of the\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha (tef1-α) and β-tubulin (tub2). The phylogenetic analyses\nrevealed the presence of Lasiodiplodia theobromae, L. laeliocattleyae\nand Neopestalotiopsis rosae. Lasiodiplodia laeliocattleyae and N. rosae\nare newly reported from Peru. Additionally, these two species are\nreported for the first time in blueberry plants associated with dieback\nsymptoms. Inoculation trials of blueberry plants confirmed the\npathogenicity of Lasiodiplodia and Neopestalotiopsis species and\nrevealed differences in aggressiveness among species and isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125654.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125653.phy"}]}
