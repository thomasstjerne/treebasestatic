The highly variable morphology among strains and\nnatural populations suggested that this taxon was in need of revision\nusing a combination of molecular and morphological characters.\nThirty-six isolates that were assigned to D. serratus based on\nmorphology, or that were known to be closely related to D. serratus\nbased on DNA sequence analysis were examined. These isolates were\nevaluated by light microscopy, electron microscopy, and phylogenetic\nanalysis of DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer regions, nuclear 5.8S rDNA, and the plastid rbcL\ngene. Based upon these analyses, we propose the new species D.\nitascaensis, D. perdix, D. serratoides, D. pseudoserratus, and D.\nsantosii. These species as well as D. serratus form a monophyletic\nlineage that is allied with the small, spineless species, D.\ncostato-granulatus, D. lunatus, D. elegans, D. ultrasquamatus and D.\nregularis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8984.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8994","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8994.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8980","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8980.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8993","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8993.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8983","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8983.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8978","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8978.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8976","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8976.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8977","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8977.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8979","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8979.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8981","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8981.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8982","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8982.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8985.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8986","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8986.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8987","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8987.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8988.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8989","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8989.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8990","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8990.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8991.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8992","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8992.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8995","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8995.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8996","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8996.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8997","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8997.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8998","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8998.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7863.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7864.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7865","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7865.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7866.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 5","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7867.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 6","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7868.phy"}]}
