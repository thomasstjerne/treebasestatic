The purpose\nof this research was to (1) test the monophyly of the subtribe\nMelinidinae, including 331 ndhF sequences of Panicoids and related\ngenera, to (2) analyze the phylogenetic relationships among genera of\nMelinidinae using four cpDNA regions, and (3) to study evolutionary\ntrends in the homogenization of inflorescences. As a result, the\nmonophyly of Melinidinae is supported if Urochloa venosa is excluded\nfrom the subtribe. Alloteropsis semialata subsp. semialata, an unusual\nPCK species, is here confirmed within the Forest shade clade. Within\nMelinidinae, Urochloa and Eriochloa appeared as paraphyletic and\npolyphyletic genera, respectively. Finally, the general trend in the\nevolution of the inflorescences in Melinidinae seems to be the reduction\nfrom non-homogenized to complete homogenized inflorescences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Paniceae ndhF","ntax":"331","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae, ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6917.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melinidinae, trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6886.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpl16","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melinidinae, rpl16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Melinidinae ndhF","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melinidinae, ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6774.phy"},{"tree_label":"combinado","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melinidinae, cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6723.phy"}]}
