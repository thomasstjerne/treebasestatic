During studies of hypogeous sequestrate fungi in Rio Grande do\nSul State, Brazil, an unexpected new species of Lactarius was sampled\nfrom soils of an exotic Pinus plantation and described based on\nintegrative taxonomy. This new species is recognized by the hypogeous\nbasidiomes, reddish yellow to dark brown with a persistent peridium,\nwhite milky unchanging latex, globose to broadly ellipsoid\nbasidiospores, that are ornamented with a complete and dense reticulum\nand the peridiopellis composed by a cutis of repent firmly woven\nhyphae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113914.phy"}]}
