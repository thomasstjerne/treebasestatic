Zabelia has always been assumed to\nbe closely related or even congeneric with Abelia. This study presents\nmolecular and morphological data in an attempt to further clarify the\nsystematic positions of Heptacodium and Zabelia. Our molecular data\nstrongly supports a sister relationship between Heptacodium and the\nLonicera clade. Zabelia, however, seems to be closer related to the\nMorina clade than to any other member of the Linnaea clade. None of our\nphylogenetic analyses linked Abelia to Zabelia. ZabeliaÂ’s relationship\nwith the Morina clade is not supported by morphology apart from the\npresence of psilate pollen grains with an endocingulum encountered in\nboth clades. Fruit and seed morphology strongly link Abelia,\nHeptacodium, and Zabelia together. Even though wood anatomy of Zabelia\nis unique in several aspects, it cannot be used to infer the systematic\nposition of the genus. In the case of Heptacodium, hybridization is a\nplausible scenario that could explain the uncertain systematic position\nof the genus. A better understanding of the intergeneric relationships\nof the Lonicera and Linnaea clades is vital to solve this matter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP consensus pla","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6718.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI consensus pla","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6915.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI consensus nuc","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6900.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML consensus nuc","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6845.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP consensus all","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6925.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI consensus all","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6921.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML consensus all","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6784.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML consensus pla","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6719.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP consensus nuc","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heptacodium and Zabelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6782.phy"}]}
