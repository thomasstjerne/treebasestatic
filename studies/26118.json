However, it is suffering from various fungal diseases.\nIn this study, destructive canker diseases of Q. mongolica were\ninvestigated in Beijing, China. They were identified as Cytospora\nquerceae sp. nov. and C. vinacea based on detailed morphological\ncomparisons and phylogeny of ITS, LSU, act, rpb2, tef1-Î± and tub2 loci.\nThe novel species, C. querceae, is characterized by forming scattered\nand erumpent pycnidia with multiple locules, producing hyaline,\nallantoid, smooth, aseptate and a little curved in the middle conidia.\nThis study is the first record of C. querceae and C. vinacea on Quercus\nmongolica. These two species were also confirmed as causal agent of\ndieback on Q. mongolica by pathogenicity tests conducted on 2-year-old\nplants in greenhouse. The results obtained in this study improve the\nunderstanding of species causing canker or dieback diseases on important\neconomic forest trees, and provide useful information for the effective\ndisease management of Q. mongolica in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"195","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124997.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"225","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124998.phy"}]}
