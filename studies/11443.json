This marine ascomycete has so far been found only on the\ncoast of Central California, although its photobiont has a much broader\ngeographical distribution. Morphological and ecological characters have\nled a previous author to attribute this marine fungus to Verrucaria, a\ngenus including other species colonizing the intertidal zone of rocky\nseashores. Phylogenetic inferences from two nuclear and one\nmitochondrial locus confirm the placement of Verrucaria tavaresiae\nwithin the lichen family Verrucariaceae and more specifically within the\nmarine genus Wahlenbergiella. The new combination Wahlenbergiella\ntavaresiae (R.L. Moe) Gueidan, Thüs & Pérez-Ortega is therefore\nproposed here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best tree","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43800.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr43801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43801.phy"}]}
