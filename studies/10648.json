Our\nstudies have shown that there is evidence for distinguishing only one\nspecies (E. deses). Here, we define new diagnostic features for E.\ndeses, namely periplast ornamentation (the presence of small papillae \ndiscovered for the first time in this species) and the lateral location\nof the anterior canal opening, from which the flagellum emerges. We also\ndesignate the epitype and emend the diagnosis for E. deses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Edeses_MrBayes","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euglena deses, bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Edeses_NJ","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euglena deses, neighbor joining","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9892.phy"},{"tree_label":"Edeses_ML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euglena deses, maximum likelihood","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9890.phy"},{"tree_label":"Edeses_MP","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euglena deses, maximum parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9891.phy"}]}
