Support for an Agaricales-Lycoperdales\nrelationship was found, the Geastrales being clearly separated from this\nlineage. Within the Lycoperdales, Lycoperdon was found to be\npolyphyletic, whereas Bovista appeared to be monophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS/noLepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5576.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5573.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS-RFLP unrooted network","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5574.phy"}]}
