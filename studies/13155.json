Jeyawati rugoculus, gen. et\nsp. nov., is diagnosed by a rugose texture that covers the entire\nlateral surface of the postorbital and the presence of a large\nneurovascular foramen at the base of the jugal process of the\npostorbital, as well as a unique combination of characters.Apreliminary\nphylogenetic analysis reveals that Jeyawati is a basal hadrosauroid more\nderived than Probactrosaurus, Eolambia,and Protohadros, but more basal\nthan Shuangmiaosaurus, Bactrosaurus,and Telmatosaurus. Assessment of\nontogenetic criteria indicates that MSM P4166 represents a subadult or\nadult individual. Even with the recognition of Jeyawati, Late Cretaceous\nhadrosauroid biogeography remains somewhat ambiguous because of the lack\nof material from the late TuronianÂ–early Santonian in western North\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 10","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ankylopollexia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55688.phy"}]}
