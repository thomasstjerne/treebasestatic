To date, thirteen EpichloÃ« species and\ntwenty Neotyphodium species have been formally described, based on\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analyses. Most of them are\nfrom the native grass. Leymus chinensis (Poaceae) is a dominant grass\nnative to the Inner Mongolia steppe of China. Previously, it was\nreported to harbor endophytes, but little was known about these\nendophytes. To investigate their diversities and taxonomy, ninety six\nfungal isolates were obtained from three field local populations of L.\nchinensis. The isolates were classified into three morphotypes based on\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analyses of Î²â“tubulin gene\n(tubB), translation elongation factor 1â“Î± gene (tefA) and actin genes\n(actG) sequences. The dominant morphotype, morphotype I, was identified\nas a choke disease endophyte, EpichloÃ« bromicola. This broadened the\nhost range and phylogenetic definition of E. bromicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"actG","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP analyses of actG of endophytes from Leymus\nchinensis","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53159.phy"},{"tree_label":"tubB","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP analyses of tubB of endophytes from Leymus\nchinensis","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53157.phy"},{"tree_label":"tefA","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP analyses of tefA of endophytes from Leymus\nchinensis","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53158.phy"}]}
