Due to the sequence and length\nvariation encountered, the ITS is unsuitable for comparison at the\nspecies level within Smittium, as presently delimited. Intra- and\ninterspecific variation of 18S rDNA was also analyzed. Cladistic\nanalysis of 32 new 18S rDNA sequences resolved at least five lineages\nand suggests that Smittium is non-monophyletic. In addition, 17 18S rDNA\nsequences from 5 orders of Zygomycota were included to assess phyletic\nrelationships with the Trichomycetes. The kickxellid origin of\nTrichomycetes was not strongly supported. Morphological features of\ntrichomycete taxa included in this study are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Harpellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3659.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Harpellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3660.phy"}]}
