The\nnew species is morphologically characterized by its white colonies on\nCMA, PCA, PDA, and YMA, thallic conidiogenous cells, simple, catenate\nand hyaline conidia. Phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences also supported the\nplacement of O. albicans as a new species in the genus Oidiodendron\n(anamorph of Myxotrichum). To compare with related species, the optimal\npH and temperature for growth were investigated. A key to the species of\nthe genera Oidiodendron and Myxotrichum producing hyaline conidia is\nprovided in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Oidiodendron tree","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114236","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114236.phy"}]}
