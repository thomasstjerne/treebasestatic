Recently, C. ocellata bassleri was\nelevated to full species, based on analysis of a few molecular samples\nfrom Peru. This species complex is widely distributed in South America,\noccurring in Amazonia, Cerrado, Atlantic forest and Pampa biomes. The\nmonophyly and species diversity of C. ocellata are still unstudied.\nHere, we infer phylogenetic relationships and species diversity of this\ngroup analysing 2326 base pairs of three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and\nND4) and one nuclear (c-mos) genes. Our taxon sampling of 115 specimens\nincludes 72 samples of C. ocellata and sequences of other Cercosaura\nspecies and closely related Cercosaurinae. Maximum likelihood\nphylogenetic analysis recovered the monophyly of Cercosaura and that of\nC. ocellata with strong support. Our analyses suggest that C. ocellata\nis a complex of cryptic species, which possibly started diversifying in\nAmazonia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102060","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102060.phy"}]}
