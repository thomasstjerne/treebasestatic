We have\nsequenced a partial ssurDNA region for 10 isolates in five genera,\nincluding Diplophrys marina(a possible labyrinthulid relative which\nlacks bothrosomes). We also include sequences of two isolates of the\nnorthern quahog pathogen, QPX, a thraustochytrid of uncertain taxonomic\naffinities. Our ssurDNA sequence analysis indicates that members of the\nLabyrinthulomycota fall into three phylogenetic groups. These groups\ncorrespond to the three morphological extremes found within the phylum;\nthe labyrinthulids, the thraustochytirds, and the labyrinthuloids. QPX\nsequences support its inclusion as a thraustochytrid. Diplophrys marina\nalso appears to show phylogenetic affinity with the thraustochytrids.\nKey Words: Diplophrys marina, QPX, stramenopile, thraustochytrid,\nlabyrinthula, evolution, heterokont, zoosporic fungi","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Labyrinthulomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3721.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Labyrinthulomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3722.phy"}]}
