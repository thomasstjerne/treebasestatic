The specimens of\nthese fungi exhibit a dried texture on its own basidiomata, although\nthey are classified under gelatinous fruiting body. This draws an\ninterest to investigate the classification of these unique fungi using\ntaxonomic and molecular analyses. The sequences of internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) regions revealed that P. sclerodontium is excluded from its\ncurrent Exidiaceae family. The phylogenetic analyses supported the\nmonophyly of P. sclerodontium and conclude that this species should be\nplaced in the family of Tremellacanthaceae JÃ¼lich fam. nov based on the\nphylogenetic analysis of ITS regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML analysis of ITS region for P. sclerodontium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60253.phy"}]}
