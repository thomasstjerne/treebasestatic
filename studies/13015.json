Despite a long history of\nresearch, ankylosaur interrelationships remain poorly resolved and\nexisting cladistic analyses suffer from limited character and taxon\nsampling. Here, we present the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis\nof the group attempted to date. The traditional ankylosauridnodosaurid\ndichotomy is maintained. Ankylosauridae forms a well-resolved clade,\nwhich includes Zhongyuansaurus, the first ankylosaurid known to lack a\ntail club. Nodosauridae includes a number of taxa that were resolved\neither as ‘polacanthids’ or basal ankylosaurids in previous analyses.\nThe use of a broader character sample allows analysis of the\ninterrelationships of all valid ankylosaur species; this has revealed\nseveral previously unrecognized relationships. Stegosauria is recovered\nas the sister taxon to Ankylosauria, while Scelidosaurus is found to be\na basal thyreophoran. Dedicated methods for coding continuous characters\ncould be used in future to improve the resolution of ankylosaur\nphylogeny, particularly in order to explore the relationships within the\npoorly resolved nodosaurid clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thyreophora phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55253.phy"}]}
