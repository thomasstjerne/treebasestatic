These two species were described in 1968 (P. dianae) and in 1972\n(P. punctatus) based on material collected in the Czech Republic. Now,\nfor the first time, further collections are identified based on\nmolecular analysis, and the first findings of these species from East\nand North Europe (P. dianae from Denmark and Russia, P. punctatus from\nSweden) are given. Variability of macrocharacters, microcharacters,\necology and distribution of Pluteus dianae and P. punctatus were\nenlarged based on recent findings. The application of both names is\ndiscussed, based on our type studies and additional recent collections.\nBoth species belong in the Pluteus plautus species complex (Pluteus\nsect. Hispidoderma), and based on the data presented here they are\ndistinct from all other known taxa in this group. European and North\nAmerican taxa (data on European taxa?) of P. plautus group are\nsummarised and compared with Pluteus dianae and P. punctatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112834","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112834.phy"}]}
