Morphological and molecular analyses revealed that this\nspecies is new to science belonging to Erysiphe sect. Californiomyces\nthat mainly distributes in tropical region of Asia. Erysiphe kissiana\nsp. nov. is the first record of section Californiomyces in Japan. This\nspecies has also an affinity to E. gracilis that occurs on evergreen oak\nin temperate region of East Asia, which suggests that E. kissiana is a\nmissing link between Erysiphe species distributed in tropical and\ntemperate regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78443","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78443.phy"}]}
