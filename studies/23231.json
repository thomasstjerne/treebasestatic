We report\nStegnogramma leptogrammoides from Yunnan as a new discovery for China.\nThis species was identified based on morphological comparison with the\ntype specimens of all similar species, and DNA barcoding was performed\nto obtain additional evidence. As it was previously recorded to be\nendemic to Sikkim, the new record provides a case for confirming\nfloristic affinities between Sikkim and Yunnan within the Pan-Himalaya\nat the species level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stegnogramma leptogrammoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113454.phy"}]}
