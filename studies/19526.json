These conidial structures are similar to those of\nthe genus Pestaloia. The genus Synnemapestaloides is classified in the\nfamily Amphisphaeriaceae solely according to its conidial structure.\nHere we demonstrate that Synnemapestaloides represents a distinct genus\nin the family Discosiaceae (Amphisphaeriales) according to the\nnucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer and ÔÅ¢-tubulin.\nThe genus and species most closely related to Synnemapestaloides are\nSeimatosporium and Seim. foliicola, respectively. We conclude therefore\nthat Seim. foliicola should be classified as a paraphyletic genus. These\nresults demonstrate that asexual morphs of Discosiaceae have pycnidial\nor, acervular conidiomata or synnematal conidiomata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97113","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97113.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97114","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97115","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97116.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97118","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97110.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97111","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97111.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97112","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97112.phy"}]}
