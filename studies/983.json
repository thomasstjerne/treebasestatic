These include C. fimbriata, C. eucalypti, C. moniliformis,\nand C. moniliformopsis. Of these, only C. fimbriata is known as a\npathogen, where it has recently been found causing serious wilt diseases\nin Uganda, Congo, and Brazil. This study was undertaken to collect\nCeratocystis species, including C. eucalypti, from artificially induced\nwounds on Eucalyptus nitens near Canberra in southeastern Australia.\nTrees were wounded in October 2000 and wounds were examined\napproximately one month later. Ascomata characteristic of a Ceratocystis\nspecies, were found covering the wounds and this fungus was also\nisolated from the wood using carrot baiting. This species of\nCeratocystis has hat-shaped ascospores similar to those of C. fimbriata\nbut it differs from C. fimbriata and all other species of Ceratocystis\nin possessing ascomata with a pyriform base. Comparison of DNA sequences\nfrom the ITS and 5.8S rRNA operon confirmed that the fungus from E.\nnitens in Australia is unique and we describe it here as a new species,\nC. pirilliformis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratocystis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4071.phy"}]}
