Using two sets of degenerate primer pairs, we detected\n73 different basidiomycete laccase genes from soil DNA extracts and 42\ndifferent transcripts of asco- and basidiomycetes from soil RNA extracts\n(cDNA libraries). Phylogenetic analysis related the sequences to fungal\ntaxa. The highest fungal laccase gene richness in soil DNA and RNA\nsamples were found in August, October and January, and followed the\ninput of fresh litter into soil. The highest change of the fungal\nlaccase gene population was observed from October to January, but no\ndistinct temporal change in the total soil laccase activity was\nmeasured. Present and expressed laccase gene populations were highly\ndifferent, implying different subsets amplified with our primer sets and\nlikely impacting future research strategies. Despite considerable\nvariations in gene presence and expression, we found a steady expression\nand high soil enzyme activity of fungal laccases at each sampling date,\nthus presumably laccases have major impacts to soil organic matter\nturnover and stabilisation processes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungal laccase genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6375.phy"}]}
