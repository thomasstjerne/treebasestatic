Characters used in the analysis include vegetative and\nfloral morphology, anatomy, embryology, pollen ultrastructure,\nchromosome cytology, and flavonoid and amino acid chemistry.\nIsophysidoideae, with a superior ovary, include only the Tasmanian\nIsophysis. Nivenioideae include the Afro-Madagascan Aristea, three woody\nCape genera, the Australasian Patersonia, and Geosiris. The\nlast-mentioned. a saprophyte, restricted to Madagascar, appears to be\nmost closely related to Aristea and is not recognized at the tribal\nlevel. Iridoideae have four reasonably well differentiated tribes and a\nworldwide but predominantly southern distribution. The subfamily is\nspecialized in floral and phytochemical features. Ixioideae, which\ncomprise slightly more than half the total species of Iridaceae, are\npredominantly southern African and have derived leaf anatomy, pollen\nexine, flavonoids, and inflorescences. Three tribes are recognized in\nIxioideae and four in Iridoideae in both of which some subtribal\ngroupings are suggested. Described formally here are Nivenioideae and\nPillansieae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 3-5","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Iridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1496.phy"}]}
