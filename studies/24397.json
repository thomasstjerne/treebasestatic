The aims of this research are evaluate the\nantimicrobial and antioxidant activities of extracts from endophytic\nfungi, identify the potential fungal isolate by phylogenetic analysis\nand analyze the composition of the potential crude extract by GC-MS.\nEndophytic fungi were isolated from healthy leaves of C. carandas. A\ntotal of 109 fungal isolates were obtained from 900 segments. All fungal\nisolates were identified based on their morphological characteristics.\nThirty-six fungal isolates were selected by their morphological\nappearance on potato dextrose agar and cultured into potato dextrose\nbroth. Fungal endophytes were extracted with hexane, and ethyl acetate.\nOne hundred and eight extracts were tested for their antimicrobial and\nantioxidant activities by using colorimetric broth microdilution and\nDPPH free radical scavenging assays. The endophytic fungus Nigrospora\nsp. TSU-EFHA009 (accession number MK033475) produced the best active\nextracts. Broth ethyl acetate extract (CE) had the strongest activity\nagainst Cryptococcus neoformans at MIC 4 and MFC 8 µg/mL. Moreover, the\nantimicrobial activity was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM). The morphology of target cells was damage. In addition, this\nactive extract had the highest antioxidant activity with inhibitory\nconcentration (IC50) value of 0.03 mg/mL. The potential extract was\ndetected the total phenolic content by using colorimetric method. It\ncontained total phenolic content as 41.20±0.40 mg GAE/g. The results\nfrom this first study indicated that endophytic fungi from C. carandas\nare good source of antimicrobial and antioxidant substances.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117268.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117269","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117269.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117275","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117275.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117274","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117274.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117273","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117273.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117272","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117272.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117271","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117271.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117270","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117270.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117277.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117276.phy"}]}
