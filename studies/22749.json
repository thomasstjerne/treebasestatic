The taxon is morphologically similar to other\nknown taxa in Valsariaceae and is characterized by pseudostromatic\nstromata, apically free paraphyses, bitunicate asci and dark brown\n2-celled ascospores. However it differs from extant species in terms of\nnumber of guttules and spore ornamentation. It is introduced herein as\nValsaria ostryae. sp. nov. within the family Valsariaceae. Multigene\nphylogenies based on LSU, ITS and rpb2 sequence data generated from\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and MrBayes analyses indicate that\nV.ostryae forms an independent lineage and nested in between V.\nlopadostomoides and V.neotropica and its establishment as a new species\nis strongly supported. No discordance was found between our\nmorphological and phylogenetic species boundaries as postulated by other\nresearchers but our molecular data strongly supports spore ornamentation\nas a phylogenetically informative character useful for species\ndelineation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111987","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111987.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111988.phy"}]}
