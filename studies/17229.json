We performed Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses for different combinations of datasets. Our results provide a\nstrongly supported phylogenetic picture of the phlebioid clade,\nrepresenting 89 species in the four genes analyses, of which 49\nrepresent phanerochaetoid taxa. Phanerochaete sensu lato is polyphyletic\nand distributed across nine lineages in the phlebioid clade. Six of\nthese lineages are associated to already described genera, while we\ndescribe the new genus Phaeophlebiopsis to accommodate Phlebiopsis-like\nspecies in one of the remaining lineages. We also propose three\ntaxonomic transfers and describe eight new species, with four of those\nspecies currently placed in Phanerochaete sanguinea or Phanerochaete\nvelutina. Finally, the placement of Leptoporus mollis along with other\npotential brown-rot species in the phlebioid clade suggests that, in\naddition to the Antrodia clade, brown-rot may have evolved more than\nonce in Polyporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sup Fig. 5a","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceriporia-Meruliopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85970.phy"},{"tree_label":"Sup Fig. 5b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Efibula and related taxa ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85975.phy"}]}
