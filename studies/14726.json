Cognettia is an\nenchytraeid genus commonly found in acidic terrestrial habitats, such as\nconiferous forests and bogs. The diversity of the genus, with particular\nfocus on the morphospecies C. sphagnetorum in northern Europe, is\nassessed using four molecular markers, the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome\nc oxidase subunit I) and16S (16s ribosomal RNA), and the nuclear H3\n(Histone 3) and ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer). The datasets were\nfirst delimitated into Molecular Operational Units (MOTU:s) and the\nexistence of global barcoding-gaps was tested. Single gene-trees were\nthen estimated for all genes using Bayesian Inference, and a species\ntree was estimated with all markers combined using the multi-species\ncoalescence. The results show that in northern Europe the genus consists\nof at least eight MOTU:s supported by all genes except H3. Four of these\nMOTU:s are within the morphotaxon C. sphagnetorum and two within C.\nglandulosa. Cognettia sphagnetorum s.l. is found to be non-monophyletic\nin all gene-trees, as well as in the species tree. As the MOTU:s are\nwell separated and non-monophyly is observed within C. sphagnetorum s.l.\nwe conclude that the MOTU:s are best treated as separate species. As\ncryptic diversity is found in this genus we recommend that material of\nCognettia used in future studies should be identified using molecular\nbarcodes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66711.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66712.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66710.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66714.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66715.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66717.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66716.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cognettia sphagnetorum 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66713.phy"}]}
