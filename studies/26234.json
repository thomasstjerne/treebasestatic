In the field, the three species were\nassociated with roots of Ammophila arenaria, Elymus farctus, Otanthus\nmaritimus and Echinophora spinosa colonizing maritime dunes located\nalong the Mediterranean coast in the Eastern of Spain. The novelty of\nthese species is supported by morphological, molecular and phylogenetic\nanalyses. Single-species cultures of S. mediterraneum and F. pillosus\nhave been obtained using Trifolium repens as host plant, both forming\narbuscular mycorrhizae, whereas single-species cultures from G. ibericum\ncould not be obtained. Spores of G. ibericum usually occur in\nsporocarps, rarely singly in soil or inside roots; S. mediterraneum only\nforms single spores in soil; while F. pillosus occurs in sporocarps and\nsingly in soil or inside roots. The respective SSU-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-LSU\nnrDNA sequences placed the new species in the genus Glomus, Septoglomus\nand Funneliformis, all of them separated from previously described\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Guillen ML analysis LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123467.phy"}]}
