The molecular\ntopologies supported five to six allopatric taxa in Jubula.\nRelationships of most of these taxa remain unresolved due to lack of\nsupport of many deeper nodes. A Principal Component Analysis indicated a\nbroad overlap of morphological characters of these taxa. Based on the\nmorphological similarities of the Jubula taxa and the observed low\nsequence variation, a subspecies concept is supported. This comprises\nthe taxa J. hutchinsiae subsp. bogotensis, subsp. hutchinsiae, subsp.\njaponica, subsp. javanica and subsp. pennsylvanica. With the exception\nof J. hutchinsiae subsp. javanica, all these taxa are monophyletic.\nMultiple accessions of the temperate taxa J. hutchinsiae subsp.\nhutchinsiae and J. hutchinsiae subsp. pennsylvanica exhibit a lower\nsequence variation than the tropical taxa J. hutchinsiae subsp.\nbogotensis and J. hutchinsiae subsp. javanica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of the liverwort Jubula Dumort","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6247.phy"}]}
