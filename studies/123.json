Sixty-five\nrestriction sites were detected among 11 species of Onagraceae (one each\nof Circaea, Fuchsia, Hauya, Oenothera, and Ludwigia, and six species of\nEpilobium) using 20 restriction enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis of the\ndata was performed using both Wagner and Dollo parsimony, and the\nresulting monophyletic groups were tested by the bootstrap method. The\ntrees were rooted by using Ludwigia as a functional outgroup. Phenetic\napproaches (cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis) were\nalso applied to the data as a complement to the cladistic analysis.\nWagner parsimony analysis generated four equally parsimonious trees (53\nsteps, consistency index.0.76), and Dollo parsimony analysis generated\nsix equally parsimonious trees (59 steps, consistency index 0.67). In\nall trees the six species of Epilobium form a monophyletic group.\nIndependent data on Onagraceae (morphological, cytological, anatomical,\nchemosystematic, and molecular) strongly support one of the six\nphylogenetic hypotheses generated by Dollo parsimony analysis, in which\nCircaea, Fuchsia, and Hauya form one branch with Circaea the sister\ngroup to Fuchsia-Hauya, and Oenothera and Epilobium form the other\nbranch. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis do not agree\nwith the phylogenetic analyses mainly in the position of Epilobium,\nsuggesting the possibility of different rates of evolutionary change in\ndifferent lines of the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3D","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2II","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1629.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1630.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3F","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1631.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3E","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1632.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3C","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1635.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2I, D","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2I, C","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1639.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2I, B","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1640.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2I, A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1641.phy"}]}
