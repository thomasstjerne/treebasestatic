Well-supported clades are in general compatible with\nearlier, more limited, analyses, and current classification is largely\nin agreement with our results, although there are some notable\nexceptions. Bdellonemertea (represented by Malacobdella) is found to be\na part of Monostilifera, and Polystilifera is the monophyletic sister\ngroup to Monostilifera. Cratenemertidae is the sister group to the\nremaining monostiliferan (including Malacobdella), a group for which we\napply the new name Distromatonemertea. Heteronemertea is monophyletic\nand forms a clade with Hubrechtella; for this clade we introduce the\nname Pilidiophora. Finally, Pilidiophora and Hoplonemertea (with\nMalacobdella) form a monophyletic group and we introduce the name\nNeonemertea to refer to this group. Palaeonemertea is found to be\nnon-monophyletic and basal among nemerteans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nemertea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_875.phy"}]}
