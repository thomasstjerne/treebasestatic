The isolation of this fungus into axenic culture initiated\nnew possibilities for investigations, namely cultural morphology, LSU\nand SSU molecular phylogenies, life cycle karyology, and mating\nexperiments. The comparative morphological data revealed that this\nspecies belongs in Rogersiomyces and the combination Rogersiomyces\nmalaysianus is proposed. Molecular studies revealed close relationships\nof Rogersiomyces, Sistotrema s. lat. and Hydnum s. str. (Cantharellales,\nAgaricomycetes). It was revealed that basidiospores of the fungus are\nbinucleate and giving rise a dikaryotic mycelium after germination. The\ncultural characters and reproductive structures of this unusual\nsistotremoid fungus are described. It was concluded that dikaryotization\ninto basidium in this fungus, its ephemeral basidiomata and\nstatismosporic basidia represent an adaptation to irregular, but\nplentiful moistening within monsoonal climates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rogersiomyces malaysianus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95070.phy"}]}
