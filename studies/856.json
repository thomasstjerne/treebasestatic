However, the conclusion of amphisbaenian\naffinities was based on a partitioned analysis that excluded relevant\ndata and included reconstructed characters. When characters for analysis\nare limited to those that are observable on the fossils and all evidence\nis included and analyzed simultaneously, results do not support S.\nhexatabularis as an amphisbaenian, but instead suggest that S.\nhexatabularis may be related to macrocephalosaurids. Several potential\nsynapomorphies of S. hexatabularis and macrocephalosaurids are provided,\nincluding: presence of lateral process of palatal ramus of pterygoid;\npostorbital large and extending posteriorly beyond supratemporal\nfenestra approaching posterior edge of cranial roof; and tall, narrow,\ndorsal process of maxilla. S. hexatabularis is tentatively reassigned to\nthe Macrocephalosauridae. The origin of amphisbaenians remains\nobscure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic position of Sineoamphisbaena\nhexatabularis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3991.phy"}]}
