It is distinct from other\ngenera of the Pottiaceae by a combination of characters: absence of\ncentral strand in the stem, lingulate unbordered leaves with yellow KOH\ncolour reaction, costa at midleaf with one band of dorsal stereids,\n(1)2-3 guide cells layers, absence of hydroids, and sporophyte with\nperistome of 16 variously cleft, occasionally perforate, coarsely\npapillose, short and straight teeth. The species is described,\nillustrated and mapped. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of\nchloroplast DNA sequences (trnL-trnF and trnG regions) were undertaken.\nThe resultants trees suggest that the new genus could be one of the\nearlier diverging lineages within the Pottioideae and Barbuloideae\nsubfamilies of Pottiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Majority-rule (50%) consensus tree resulting from\nBayesian analysis of a combined 2-gene, trnL-F and trnG.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8911.phy"}]}
