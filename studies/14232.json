Its taxonomy is not yet resolved and the phylogenetic\nvalue of the most distinctive morphological features is unknown. The\nspecies of this genus produce conidia in chains or forming slimy heads\nor both. We have studied a set of clinical and environments strains of\nAcremonium fusidioides and related species, morphologically\ncharacterized by producing mostly catenate fusiform conidia. Based on\nphenotypic data and in the analysis of the sequences of the ITS region,\nthe D1/D2 domains of the 28S rRNA gene and a fragment of the tubulin\ngene three new species belonging to the family Bionectriaceae of the\nHypocreales, are described, i.e., Acremonium pilosum, Acremonium parvum\nand Acremonium citrinum. The first species produces two kinds of\nconidia, clavate with smooth wall and globose with abundant filiform\nprojections. Acremonium parvum is characterized by a very slow growth\nand pyriform or slightly lanceolate conidia with an elongate and\ntruncate base. Acremonium citrinum produces a diffusible yellow pigment\nand obovoid conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acremonium tubulin ITS D1D2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85681.phy"}]}
