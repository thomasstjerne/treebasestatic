It inhabits leaves of deciduous trees submerged in\nsmall ditches or puddles in slightly minerotrophic bogs and mires.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses of partial nLSU and of the\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences are given to reveal its phylogenetic\nposition. Although it is morphologically clearly attributable to the\nanamorph genus Spirosphaera, LSU rDNA sequence data show that it is not\nrelated to the type species of the genus, Spirosphaera floriformis.\nWhereas Spirosphaera floriformis is phylogenetically placed within the\nunitunicate Leotiomycetidae sensu lato, Spirosphaera cupreorufescens is\nembedded within the bitunicate Dothideomycetes. The genus Spirosphaera\nin its current circumscription is shown to be polyphyletic; however,\nlack of morphologically discriminating features prevent generic\nsplitting, and the genus Spirosphaera is maintained as an anamorph\nform-genus. A key to all described species of Spirosphaera is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirosphaera cupreorufescens, MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_468.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirosphaera cupreorufescens, MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1891.phy"}]}
