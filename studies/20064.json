SEMIA3007 was analyzed within the Mesorhizobium groups to define\nthe underlying causes of taxonomic identification. We previously used\nbiochemical tests and phenotypic taxonomic methods to identify bacteria,\nwhich can lead to erroneous classification. An improved understanding of\nbacterial strains such as the Mesorhizobium genus would increase our\nknowledge of classification and evolution of these species. Results: In\nthis study, we sequenced the complete genome of SEMIA3007 and compared\nit with five other Mesorhizobium and two Rhizobium genomes. The genomes\nof isolated SEMIA3007 showed several orthologs with M. huakuii, M.\nerdmanii and M. loti. We identified SEMIA3007 as a Mesorhizobium by\ncomparing the 16S rRNA gene and the complete genome. Conclusion: Our\northolog, 16S rRNA gene and average nucleotide identity values (ANI)\nanalysis all demonstrate SEMIA3007 is not Rhizobium leguminosarum bv.\nviceae. The results of the phylogenetic analysis clearly show SEMIA3007\nis part of the Mesorhizobium group and suggest a reclassification is\nwarranted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101490.phy"}]}
