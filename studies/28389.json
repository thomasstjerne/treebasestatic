Most\ngenera of rhabdocoels can easily be classified into one of these two\nsubgroups, except for the three monotypic representatives of the\nMariplanellinae. Comparative morphological data and previous molecular\nphylogenetic analyses have so far been unable to determine the positions\nof these rarely encountered microturbellarians within the context of\nrhabdocoels. Here we describe a new species of Mariplanellinae,\nMariplanella piscadera sp. nov. from Curaçao (Dutch Caribbean), and\npresent an updated phylogeny inferred from 18S and 28S rDNA sequences,\nincluding data from M. piscadera sp. nov., M. frisia, and a selection of\nrhabdocoels, proseriates and other trepaxonematan flatworms. Our\nmolecular phylogenetic trees reveal that Mariplanella belongs to a\ndistinct higher-level group of rhabdocoels that forms the sister lineage\nto a clade uniting Kalyptorhynchia and Dalytyphloplanida. Therefore, we\nupdate the status of Mariplanellinae to Mariplanellida status novus,\ncontaining the family Mariplanellidae status novus, in order to better\nreflect our current understanding of rhabdocoel phylogeny and the\nestablishment of now three major subgroups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131690.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mariplanella Clipkit RAxML","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131688","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_131688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mariplanella Clipkit MrBayes","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131689","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_131689.phy"}]}
