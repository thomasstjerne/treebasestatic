To examine the degree of congruence between\nthe phylogenies of 17 Pectinopygus species and their pelecaniform hosts,\nsequences from mitochondrial 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, COI, and nuclear\nwingless and EF1-a genes (2290 nucleotides) and frommitochondrial 12S\nrRNA, COI, and ATPases 8 and 6 genes (1755 nucleotides) were obtained\nfor the lice and the birds, respectively. Louse data partitions were\nanalyzed for evidence of incongruence and evidence of long-branch\nattraction prior to cophylogenetic analyses. Host-parasite coevolution\nwas studied by different methods: TreeFitter, TreeMap, ParaFit,\nlikelihood-ratio test, data-based parsimony method, and correlation of\ncoalescence times. All methods agree that there has been extensive\ncospeciation in this host-parasite system, but the results are sensitive\nto the selection of different phylogenetic hypotheses and analytical\nmethods for evaluating cospeciation. Perfect congruence between\nphylogenies is not found in this association, probably as a result of\noccasional host switching by the lice. Errors due to phylogenetic\nreconstruction methods, incorrect or incomplete taxon sampling or to\ndifferent loci undergoing different evolutionary histories cannot be\nrejected, thus emphasising the need for improved cophylogenetic\nmethodologies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3d","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus, 1 of 13 MPTs from EF1 alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2732.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus, 1 of 1 MPTs from 16S rRNA excluding\nvariable regions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2730.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3e","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus, 1 of 2 MPTs from Wingless","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2733.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined maximum likelihood topology of 3 Pelecaniforme\ngenes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined maximum likelihood topology of 3 Pelecaniforme\ngenes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus maximum parsimony tree from the combined\nanalysis of the 5 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus maximum likelihood tree from the combined\nanalysis of the 5 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4818.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus, 1 of 39 MPTs from COI excluding 2nd and\n3rd positions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pectinopygus, 1 of 1 MPTs from 12S rRNA excluding\nvariable regions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2729.phy"}]}
