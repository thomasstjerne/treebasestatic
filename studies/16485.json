These sites were either permanent or temporary\ngrasslands, or subjected to low-input organic, or medium to high-input\nconventional no-tillage and tillage farming systems. The sites had been\nexposed to very different levels of phosphorus fertilization in the past\nas suggested by quite diverging levels of soil P availability at\nsampling time. The fungus has been maintained in monosporal pot cultures\non Hieracium pilosella for two cycles. It is bimorphic, sensu lato\nforming acaulosporoid and glomoid spores. It can easily be identified by\nspore morphology from all other Archaeosporomycetes species by its\nsmall, triple-walled acaulosporoid spores (52â“80 Ã 51â“77 Âµm in\ndiameter) formed laterally on the neck of sporiferous saccules without\npedicel formation and surface ornamentation. The mono-walled, hyaline,\nglomoid spores (22â“33 Ã 22â“37 Âµm) resemble glomoid spores of other\nArchaeosporaceae, and of many Glomeraceae species with similar spore\nsizes and colors, and thus they do not serve for species identification.\nPhylogenetically, P. spainii forms a separate clade close to\nArchaeospora trappei and Intraspora schenckii. The different P\navailability and soil cultivation strategies at the isolation sites\nsuggest that the fungus is not much affected by these parameters in\ngrasslands or arable lands as long as almost permanent plant cover is\nguaranteed in crop rotations throughout the year. Remarkably, within the\nArchaeosporomycetes, P. spainii and A. trappei, are both frequently\nfound in Swiss low-input to high-input farming systems, while Ambispora\nspecies are usually absent under high fertilization input or intensified\nsoil cultivation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Archaeosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78364.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Archaeosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78366.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaeosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78365.phy"}]}
