The genus is particularly diverse in Africa\nwhere species are ecologically important as they are often abundant or\neven dominant in particular forest types and act as larval host plants\nfor highly specialized Cymothoe butterflies. Despite their importance,\nspecies identification of African Rinorea is difficult and a taxonomic\nrevision is needed. Previous phylogenetic studies suggest that\nNeotropical taxa are sister to a Palaeotropical clade, with multiple\nindependent dispersals to Madagascar, but these were based on plastid\ndata only. We therefore present an updated phylogeny of Rinorea with\nincreased taxonomic sampling, using plastid as well as nuclear DNA\nsequences. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from nuclear DNA data\nwere generally congruent with those based on evidence from plastid\nhaplotypes from earlier studies. In addition, our increased taxonomic\nsampling revealed additional, previously undiscovered Rinorea clades,\nsome of which warrant further taxonomic study. It is clear that African\nRinorea require comprehensive taxonomic revision; our contribution to\nunderstanding Rinorea infrageneric relationships will facilitate this\ntask.","trees":[{"tree_label":"EMB2765 ML","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69560","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69560.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MAFFT BI","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69563","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69563.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F MAFFT BI","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69554","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated A BI","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69546","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69546.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated A ML","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69547","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69547.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated B BI","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69548","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69548.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated B ML","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69549","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated D ML","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69550","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated C BI","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69551","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69551.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated C ML","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69552","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69552.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F MAFFT BI","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69553","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69553.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MAFFT BI","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69564","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69564.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F MAFFT ML","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69555","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69555.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F PRANK ML","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69558","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69558.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F PRANK BI","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69556","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69556.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMB2765 BI","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69559","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69559.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS PRANK BI","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69561","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69561.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS PRANK ML","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69562","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69562.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MAFFT ML","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69565","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69565.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F PRANK BI","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69557","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69557.phy"}]}
