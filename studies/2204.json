Therefore, in this study, we\nestimate relationships between members of the lecontei species group\nusing four approaches that are intended to estimate species, not gene,\ntrees: (1) minimize deep coalescences (MDC), (2) shallowest divergences\n(SD), (3) Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST), and (4) a novel\napproach that combines concatenation with monophyly constraints (CMC).\nMultiple populations are sampled for most species and all four methods\nincorporate this intraspecific variation into estimates of interspecific\nrelationships. We investigate the sensitivity of each method to\ntaxonomic sampling, and, for the BEST method, we assess the impact of\nprior choice on species-tree inference. We also compare species-tree\nestimates to one another and to a morphologically-based hypothesis to\nidentify clades that are supported by multiple analyses and lines of\nevidence. We find that both taxonomic sampling and method choice impact\nspecies-tree estimates and that, for these data, the BEST method is\nstrongly influenced by Î˘ and branch-length priors. We also find that\nthe CMC method is the least sensitive to taxonomic sampling. Finally,\nwhile interspecific genetic variation is low due to the recent\ndivergence of the lecontei group, our results to date suggest that\nincomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow are the main\nfactors complicating species-tree inference in Neodiprion. Based on\nthese analyses, we propose a phylogenetic hypothesis for the lecontei\ngroup. Finally, our results suggest that, even for very challenging\ngroups like Neodiprion, an underlying species-tree signal can be\nextracted from multi-locus data so long as intraspecific variation is\nadequately sampled and methods that focus on the estimation of species\ntrees are used.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6b supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion MDCmethod_ExemBdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3159.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6c supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion MDCmethod_MODdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3160.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion SDmethod_LUdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7c supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion SDmethod_MODdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7a supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion SDmethod_ExemAdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3162.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7b supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion SDmethod_ExemBdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3163.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3e","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_ExemAdataset_coalescentprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3165.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.3a","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion\nBESTmethod_ExemAdataset_exponentialprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion\nBESTmethod_ExemBdataset_exponentialprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion MDCmethod_LUdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3157.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3h","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_LUdataset_coalescentprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3171.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3d","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_LUdataset_exponentialprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3172.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3f","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_ExemBdataset_coalescentprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_MODdataset_exponentialprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3169.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3g","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion BESTmethod_MODdataset_coalescentprior","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion CMCmethod_ExemAdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3154.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion CMCmethod_ExemBdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3155.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion MDCmethod_ExemAdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5c supp.","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion CMCmethod_MODdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3156.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodiprion CMCmethod_LUdataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3153.phy"}]}
