The molecular\nphylogeny was generated to test the monophyly of the tribe, to\ninvestigate relationships between its seven genera, and to study the\nevolution of selected morphological traits within the tribe. Taxa\nstudied represented the taxonomic and morphological diversity of the\ntribe. Character evolution was inferred from morphological data treated\nas continuous and discrete data using parsimony approaches. Results\nsuggest that Physarieae are monophyletic and most closely related to\ntribes Halimolobeae, Boechereae, and Camelineae. Within the tribe, two\nmonophyletic clades are recovered: the DDNLS clade including five genera\n(Dithyrea, Dimorphocarpa, Nerisyrenia, Lyrocarpa, and Synthlipsis), and\nthe PP clade comprising two genera (Paysonia and Physaria). Several\ntraits related to trichomes, fruits, seeds, and pollen are identified as\npotential synapomorphies of the tribe and its two major clades and seven\ngenera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31379.phy"}]}
