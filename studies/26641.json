The species is morphologically\nsimilar to Umbilicaria vellea, but differs by simple, cylindrical or\nstrap-like rhizinomorphs and by thalloconidia developing both on the\nlower surface and on rhizinomorphs, 12 rarely 4celled or in aggregates\nof up to 56 cells. Umbilicaria orientalis is described from the Russian\nFar East and is currently known from a wide range of localities in East\nAsia from the Far East to South Siberia and Mongolia in the north to\nHebei and Tibet in the south. New sequences of Umbilicaria americana\nwere obtained; the species represents an independent phylogenetic\nlineage within Umbilicaria subg. Papillophora. Diagnostic traits and\nvariability of different developmental stages of Umbilicaria orientalis,\nas well as its East Asian distribution pattern are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128356","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128356.phy"}]}
