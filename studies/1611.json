Molecular divergence was very low among the sampled species,\nsuggesting a rapid diversification in Cestrum. Individual and combined\nanalyses of these molecular data sets using maximum parsimony and\nBayesian inference reject the monophyly of the traditionally recognized\nsections of Cestrum, including sect. Habrothamnus. Infrageneric\nclassifications will require significant revision. Nevertheless, the\nresolved monophyletic clades in this molecular analysis are\ngeographically structured.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cestrum section Habrothamnus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_721.phy"}]}
