By applying\ncopy-specific primers it was possible to obtain sequence data from two\ncopies of each of the nuclear genes from the two tetraploid species. The\nmost parsimonious explanation of the presence of both genes is that each\ncopy was inherited from different diploid parental species. Hence, H.\ncapense and H. secalinum are allotetraploids. The phylogenetic analyses\nalso demonstrated that the two species have a common hybrid origin\ninvolving diploid H. marinum subsp. gussoneanum and H. brevisubulatum. A\ngene tree derived from the plastid rbcL sequences showed that H.\nbrevisubulatum was the maternal parent. Based on the number of\nevolutionary changes since polyploidization and subsequent\ndiversification of the two species, the isolated occurrence of H.\ncapense in South Africa is best explained as an ancient relic, as\nopposed to a recent introduction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hordeum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1806.phy"}]}
