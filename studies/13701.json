Despite its immense diversity,\nits ecological importance in Neotropical forests, and a very long\nhistory of botanical collection, cultivation, and taxonomical research,\nAnthurium has been only cursorily sampled in previous molecular\nphylogenies. This study aims to test the monophyly of Anthurium, to\nunderstand the evolutionary history of the genus, and to elucidate\nrelationships among its species using maximum parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses on a combined chloroplast (trnG intron,\ntrnH-psbA and trnC-ycf6 intergenic spacers) and nuclear (CHS first\nintron and partial flanking coding regions) DNA sequence dataset for 102\nAnthurium species and closely related outgroups. Despite some\nlimitations (ca. 11% species richness coverage, and lack of nuclear\nsequences for outgroups), results indicate that Anthurium is a strongly\nsupported monophyletic genus and that at least 18 major supported clades\nare recognizable within it, most of them easily characterized\nmorphologically and/or geographically. This study also suggests that the\ncurrent sectional classification of Anthurium does not accurately\nrepresent its evolutionary history since most of the major clades\nrecovered in these analyses do not correspond with the current\ncircumscriptions of infrageneric groups. Despite using the most variable\ngene regions available, very low sequence divergence was found among\nAnthurium species, relatively short branches characterize the core of\nthe Anthurium clade, and resolution is still lacking in the deeper nodes\nof the phylogeny, a pattern consistent with a rapid, and probably\nrecent, radiation of species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Appendix 2","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian nDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_59299.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Likelihood_cpDNA_nDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_59297.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_59298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian_cpDNA_nDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_59296.phy"}]}
