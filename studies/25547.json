Pseudofusicoccum is known only by\nits asexual morph. Here, we describe the sexual morph for P. adansoniae.\nThe sexual morph is characterized by immersed, uniloculate ascomata,\ncylindric-clavate asci with a long pedicel, well-developed ocular\nchamber and short clavate, hyaline, aseptate ascospores, surrounded by a\nmucilaginous sheath. The connection between the sexual and asexual morph\nof P. adansoniae was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of a combined\nITS, LSU, TEF1 and Î²-tubulin dataset. Descriptions, illustrations and\nmolecular data are provided for the taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudofusicoccum ardesiacum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128355.phy"}]}
