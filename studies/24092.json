We examined the first specimen of Cintractiella\n(Ustilaginomycotina) collected from Australia and determined its\nsystematic relationship to other Fungi. Three ribosomal DNA loci were\nanalysed both with and without constraint to a phylogenomic hypothesis\nof the Ustilaginomycotina. Cintractiella did not share a most recent\ncommon ancestor with other orders of smut fungi. We used the PhyloCode\nto define the Cintractiellales, a monogeneric order with four species of\nCintractiella, including C. scirpodendri sp. nov. on Scirpodendron\nghaeri. The Cintractiellales may have shared a most recent common\nancestor with the Malasseziomycetes, but have an otherwise unresolved\nplacement at the rank of class.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Concord","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cintractiellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116287.phy"},{"tree_label":"constraint","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cintractiellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116288.phy"}]}
