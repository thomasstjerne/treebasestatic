This subfamily has a world-wide\ndistribution and is an important component of many countriesÂ’ floras. In\nthis study we present the most comprehensive sampling available to date,\nincluding data from three chloroplast genes (matK, ndhF, and rbcL) for\n85 species in the Polygonaceae (53 from Polygonoideae). Based on our\nresults, we propose a new taxonomic classification for Polygonoideae\nthat includes five well-supported tribes: Calligoneae, Fagopyreae,\nPersicarieae, Polygoneae, and Rumiceae. Overall, the results from\nmolecular data represent significant progress in understanding the\nevolutionary relationships of major groups within the family. This\nclassification also provides an assessment of diagnostic morphological\ncharacters for the tribes. The present work will continue to promote\nreevaluation of morphological characters within this diverse group,\nespecially synapomorphies for Polygonoideae, and for tribes with a\nparticularly complex history such as Fagopyreae, Persicarieae, and\nPolygoneae. A new combination, Fagopyrum tibeticum is proposed","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25894.phy"}]}
