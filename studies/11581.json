On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of DNA\nsequences from four loci, P. menonorum occurs in a clade with P.\npimiteouiense, P. vinaceum, P. guttulosum, E. rubidurum and E. parvum.\nGenealogical concordance analysis was applied to P. pimiteouiense and E.\nparvum, substantiating the phenotypically defined species. The species\nP. rubidurum, P. guttulosum and P. menonorum were on distinct branches\nstatistically excluded from inclusion in other species and have distinct\nphenotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47302.phy"}]}
