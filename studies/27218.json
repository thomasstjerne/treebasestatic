The hyphal system is covered by crystals, colourless,\nthin-walled, smooth, IKI, and CB and has basidiospores measuring 2.75.5\n× 1.84.0 µm. Sequences of the ITS and nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the\nstudied samples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were performed\nwith maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference\nmethods. The phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of ITS+nLSU\nsequences showed that two new Steccherinum species fell into the\nSteccherinaceae within the residual polyporoid clade. Further\ninvestigation was obtained for more representative taxa in the\nSteccherinum based on ITS+nLSU sequences, the results demonstrated that\nS. tenuissimum and S. xanthum were sister to S. robustius with high\nsupport (100% BP, 100% BS and 1.00 BPP).","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinum ITS nLSU 40x2117","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129726.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinum ITS nLSU 49x1820","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129727.phy"}]}
