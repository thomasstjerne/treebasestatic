Here we describe in detail its dental morphology,\ncharacterized by the presence of broad spatulated teeth (with low SI\nvalues) and the absence of denticles in their crowns. The enamel bears a\nparticular wrin- kling pattern composed only of apicobasally-aligned\npits, which are frequently joined to each other by a continuous sulcus.\nSome worn teeth have large wear-facets that extend over onlyoneof the\ncrowns edges. This unique combination of characters provides a proper\ndiagnosis forAmygdalodon. Despite thefragmentaryavailable\nmaterial,Amygdalodonishere interpreted as a non-eusauropod sauropod\nbased on the results of a phylogenetic analysis. The presence of derived\ndental characters in Amygdalodon, such as the presence of tooth- tooth\nocclusion, shows several features previously thought to diagnose\nEusauropoda or Gravisauria appeared earlier during the early evolution\nof sauropods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55549.phy"}]}
