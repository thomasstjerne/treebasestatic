B. ecuadorensis is characterised by dark gray to black pore\nsurface, a monomitic hyphal system, hyaline to yellowish-brown\ngenerative hyphae, snd ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 3.94.5 × 2.73\nμm. B. fulgida is distinguished from the other species in the genus by\nclay buff to pale brown and glancing pore surface. B. minispora is\ncharacterised by white tomentose pore mouth and small basidiospores\nmeasuring 3.14.2 × 22.8 μm. B. resupinata is characterised by resupinate\nbasidiocarps, pinkish buff to pale brownish pore surface, and ellipsoid\nto broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.56 × 3.24.1 µm. The\nclosely related taxa to four new species are discussed. An\nidentification key to then ten accepted species of Bjerkandera is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128855","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128855.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128856","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128856.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128857.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128858.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128859.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128860","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128860.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128861","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128861.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128862.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128863.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128864.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128865","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128865.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128866.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128867.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128868","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128868.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128869","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128869.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128870.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128871.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128872.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128873","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128873.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128874.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128875","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128875.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128876","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128876.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128877","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128877.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128878","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128878.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128879.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128880","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128880.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128881","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128881.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128882","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128882.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128883","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128883.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 288","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128884.phy"}]}
