Phytoplasma was testedby\nnested PCR with primers which bind to the 16S/23S intergenicspacer,\nSCYLV was checked by conventional RT-PCR with primers for the diagnostic\nORF4 region. The samples from onecultivar contained Rice yellow\ndwarfphytoplasma (CandidatusPhytoplasmaoryzae), whereas the other\nsamples respectively cultivars were phytoplasma-free. Several samples\nfrom the Egyptian breeding station and from farmer fields contained\nSugarcane yellow leaf virus. Thus some plants respectively cultivars of\nthe Egyptian sugarcane industryare infected by the pathogenic agents,\nwhich are responsible for the Yellow leaf syndrome. To our knowledge, it\nis the first report on the presence of SCYLP and SCYLV in Egypt and the\neastern Mediterranean. A sample from a Syrian sugarcane field also\ncontained phytoplasmaindicating that the yellow leaf syndrome infection\nmay be distributed throughout the Eastern Mediterranean.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64386.phy"}]}
