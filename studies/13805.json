The clade\ncurrently consists of three officially described species (Phytophthora\nporri, Phytophthora brassicae and Phytophthora primulae) that are\nhost-specific pathogens of leek, cabbages and Primula spp.,\nrespectively. However, over the past few decades, several other clade\n8b-like Phytophthoras have been found on a variety of different host\nplants that were all grown at low temperatures in winter seasons. In\nthis study, a collection of 30 of these isolates was subjected to a\nphylogenetic study using two loci (the rDNA ITS region and the\nmitochondrial coxI gene). This analysis revealed a clear clustering of\nisolates according to their host plants. To verify whether these\nisolates belong to separate species, a detailed morphological study was\nconducted. On the basis of genetic and morphological differences and\nhost specificity, we now propose the official description of three new\nspecies in clade 8b: Phytophthora dauci sp. nov., Phytophthora cichorii\nsp. nov. and Phytophthora lactucae sp. nov. Two other groups of isolates\n(Phytophthora taxon castitis and Phytophthora taxon parsley) might also\nrepresent new species but the data available at this time is\ninsufficient for an official description. This brings Phytophthora clade\n8b to a group of six species that are all host-specific, slow-growing\nand specifically infect herbaceous crops at low temperatures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora clade 8 ITS phylogeny: mrbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60412.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS Phylogeny of Phytophthora clade 8: ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60411.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CoxI phylogeny of Phytophthora clade 8: Mrbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60416.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CoxI phylogeny of Phytophthora clade 8: ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60414.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CoxI phylogeny of Phytophthora clade 8: Mrbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60415.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora clade 8 ITS phylogeny: mrbayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60413.phy"}]}
