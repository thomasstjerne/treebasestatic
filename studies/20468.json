By\nexposing low aw medium plates to the air, we isolated a new species of\nWallemia from the rooftop of a house located in an agronomic field in\nPachacamac-Lima, Peru. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis revealed its\nclosest affinities to W. hederae. We examined the macro and\nmicromorphology, growth rate and production of exudates of isolates\ncollected on media containing different amounts of glucose and NaCl (aw\nfrom 0.9993 to 0.8480). We also evaluated their chaotropic and\nkosmotropic tolerance on media with multiple molar concentrations of\nMgCl2 and MgSO4 at (aw from 0.9880 to 0.7877). Isolates are xerophilic\nand halotolerant, growing faster on glucose-supplemented media (20% and\n50% glucose) than on NaCl-supplemented media (10% and 17% NaCl). This is\nthe first new species of Wallemia described from South America and the\nfirst association of a Wallemia species with an agricultural environment\non this continent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrul","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wallemia peruviensis SSU ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101640.phy"}]}
