Cristataria and a few other genera of this subfamily\ninclude enantiomorphic pairs that are conchologically very similar to\neach other. Dextral C. colbeauiana (Pfeiffer, 1861) and its sinistral\ncounterpart of such an enantiomorphic pair occur nearby one another in\nsouthern Turkey. However, the latter has been classified either as the\nsinistral subspecies C. colbeauiana inversa Szekeres, 1998 or as a form\nof sinistral C. leprevieri (Pallary, 1922). To examine the phylogenetic\nrelationship of this enantiomorphic pair, we carried out molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of all the Turkish and two other Cristataria taxa\nbased on both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Our results show\nthat dextral C. colbeauiana and its sinistral counterpart are closest\nrelated to one another. This supports the classification of this\nenantiomorphic pair as dextral C. colbeauiana colbeauiana and sinistral\nC. colbeauiana inversa. Our results also reveal that these taxa and C.\nintersita NÃ©meth & Szekeres, 1995, sharing a characteristic collar\nbehind the aperture of the shell, represent a monophyletic lineage. By\ncontrast, the Cristataria species of non-collared shells belong to\nanother clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cristataria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115604.phy"}]}
