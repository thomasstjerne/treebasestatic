This alga can be single or form non-coenobial up to twelve\nindividuals. It has a parietal chloroplast with an embedded pyrenoid\ncovered by a starch sheath and traversed by single parallel thylakoids,\nand an eyespot located in a parietal position opposite to the flagellar\ninsertion. Lipid vacuoles are present inside the cytoplasm.\nMicrospectroscopy indicates the presence of chlorophylls a and b, with\nlutein as major carotenoid in the chloroplast, while the eyespot\nspectrum has the shape typical of green algae eyespot. The cell has four\nflagella, two longer and two shorter, of considerably different\nlength.\nSequence data from the 18S rRNA gene and ITS2 were obtained and compared\nwith published green algae sequences. Results from morphological and\nultrastructural examinations and sequence analysis support the placement\nof this alga in the Chlorophyceae as Tetraflagellochloris mauritanica L.\nBarsanti et A.
