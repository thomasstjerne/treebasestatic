The phylogenetic affinity of Tubakia to the\nfamily Melanconiellaceae (Diaporthales) was recently postulated, but new\nanalyses based on sequences retrieved from material of the type species\nof Tubakia, T. dryina, support a family of its own, viz. Tubakiaceae\nfam. nov. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed the heterogeneity of\nTubakia s. lat. which is divided into several genera, viz., Tubakia s.\nstr., Apiognomonioides gen. nov. (type species: Apiognomonioides\nsupraseptata), Involutiscutellula gen. nov. (type species:\nInvolutiscutellula rubra), Oblongisporothyrium gen. nov. (type species:\nOblongisporothyrium castanopsidis), Paratubakia gen. nov. (type species:\nParatubakia subglobosa), Racheliella gen. nov. (type species:\nRacheliella wingfieldiana sp. nov.), Saprothyrium gen. nov. (type\nspecies: Saprothyrium thailandense) and Sphaerosporithyrium gen. nov.\n(type species: Sphaerosporithyrium mexicanum sp. nov.). Greeneria\nsaprophytica is phylogenetically closely allied to Racheliella\nwingfieldiana and is therefore reallocated to Racheliella. Particular\nemphasis is laid on a revision and phylogenetic analyses of Tubakia\nspecies described from Japan and North America. Almost all North\nAmerican collections of this genus were previously referred to as T.\ndryina s. lat., which is, however, a heterogeneous complex. Several new\nNorth American species have recently been described. The new species\nSphaerosporithyrium mexicanum, Tubakia melnikiana and T. sierrafriensis,\ncausing leaf spots on several oak species found in the North-Central\nMexican state Aguascalientes and the North-Eastern Mexican state Nuevo\nLeón, are described, illustrated, and compared with similar species.\nSeveral additional new species are introduced, including Tubakia\ncalifornica based on Californian collections on various species of the\ngenera Chrysolepis, Notholithocarpus and Quercus, and T. dryinoides, T.\noblongispora, T. paradryinoides, and Paratubakia subglobosoides\ndescribed on the basis of Japanese collections. Tubakia suttoniana nom.\nnov., based on Dicarpella dryina, is a species closely allied to T.\ncalifornica and currently only known from Europe. Tubakia dryina, type\nspecies of Tubakia, is epitypified, and the phylogenetic position and\ncircumscription of Tubakia are clarified. A revised, supplemented key to\nthe species of Tubakia and allied genera on the basis of conidiomata is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Unpublished overview LSU phylogeny MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Published overview LSU BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111941.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia MP tef1 alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111953.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Unpublished overview rpb2 MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111944.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Published overview rpb2 BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111943.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia BI tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111952.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Unpublished BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111946.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Unpublished BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111947.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia unpublished ITS 1 of 1000 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111949.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Published MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111945.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia unpublished tef1 1 of 16 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111950.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia unpublished tub2 1 of 1000 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111951.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubakia Published MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111948.phy"}]}
