This African monotypic genus was originally circumscribed on\nthe basis of morphological characters. Recent phylogenetic studies have\nshown its affinity with an American species of Panicum, P. elephantipes.\nMolecular and morphological, including anatomical, characters of\nLouisiella fluitans and P. elephantipes were here performed. Both\nspecies share vegetative and reproductive characters, including habit,\nligules, blades, inflorescence, and spikelet features, such as a reduced\nlower glume, lanceolate upper glume and lower lemma, longer than the\nupper anthecium, lower palea reduced or absent and lower flower absent,\nupper anthecium indurate, and a caryopsis with a linear hilum;\nanatomically, both taxa are Kranz of the PS-subtype, with specialized\nchloroplasts on the outer parenchymatous sheath. The molecular\nphylogenetic analysis also corroborates the relationship between these\nspecies, with 100% of branch support. As a result, we concluded that P.\nelephantipes has to be transferred to the herein amphitropical genus\nLouisiella. Affinities of Louisiella with other genera of Paniceae are\nalso discussed. Finally, two lectotypes are designated for Panicum\nfistulosum and Digitaria megapotamica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69207","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69207.phy"}]}
