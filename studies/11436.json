Three of the 4 species clades were\nassigned to Xylaria cubensis (100 strains), X. grammica (33 strains),\nand Nemania diffusa (48 strains). Another fungus was tentatively\nassigned to Nemania cf. bipapillata (21 strains). Comparison of the host\nplants revealed that X. cubensis inhabited healthy leaves of at least 24\nplant species (23 genera of 21 families) as endophytes, N. diffusa was\nfound on 19 plant species (18 genera of 15 families), Nemania\ncf. bipapillata on 11 species (10 genera of 9 families), and X. grammica\non 8 species (8 genera of 7 families). The present results suggest that\nthe major xylariaceous endophytes in tropical plants are likely to be\nnon-host specific, or have a wide range of host plant preferences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylariaceous Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46876.phy"}]}
