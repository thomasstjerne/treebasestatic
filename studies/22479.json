During studies of hypogeous sequestrate fungi in Rio\nGrande do Sul State, South of Brazil, an unexpected new species of\nLactarius was finding in soils of exotic Pinus plantation and here\ndetermined based on integrative taxonomy. This new species is recognized\nby the hypogeous basidiomes, reddish yellow to dark brown with a\npersistent peridium and white milky latex. Microscopically is\ncharacterized by the globose, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid\nbasidiospores, ornamentation forming a complete and densely reticulum\nand the peridiopellis forming a cutis of repent firmly woven\nhyphae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree ITS","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LactariusTreebase","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110716.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110717","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110717.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113442","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113442.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113443","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113443.phy"}]}
