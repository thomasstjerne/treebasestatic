This has\ndrawn attention to the potential importance of Fusarium species as\npathogens of forest trees. In this study, we explored the diversity of\nFusarium species associated with diseased Pinus patula, P. tecunumanii,\nP. kesiya and P. maximinoi in Colombian plantations and nurseries.\nPlants displaying symptoms typical of F. circinatum infection (i.e. stem\ncankers and branch die-back on trees in plantations and root or collar\nrot of seedlings) were sampled. A total of 57 isolates were collected\nand characterized based on DNA sequence data for the TEF and β-tubulin\ngene regions. Phylogenetic analyses of these data allowed for the\nidentification of 10 Fusarium species. These included F. circinatum, F.\noxysporum, F. solani and seven novel species in the Gibberella fujikuroi\ncomplex, five of which are described here as Fusarium parvisorum sp.\nnov., F. fracticaudum sp. nov., Fusarium marasasianum sp. nov., F.\npinemorale sp. nov. and F. sororula sp. nov. Selected isolates of the\nfive new species were tested for their pathogencity on Pinus patula and\ncompared with that of F. circinatum. Of these, F. pinemorale sp. nov.\nand F. parvisorum sp. nov. displayed levels of pathogenicity to P.\npatula, that were comparable with that of F. circinatum. These\napparently emerging pathogens thus pose a significant risk to forestry\nin Colombia and other parts of the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 19 from INCOMPLETE search (criterion:
