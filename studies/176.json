Echinocaulon were\nexamined for leaf flavonoid constituents. Thirty-six flavonoid compounds\nwere isolated and identified, most of which were glycosylated and/or\nmethoxylated derivatives of the flavonols kaempferol, quercetin, and\nmyricetin, and of the flavones apigenin and luteolin. Among them,\nquercetin 3-O-glycosides were major flavonoid constituents, and present\nin all species. Species of section Echinocaulon exhibit relatively\ncomplex patterns of leaf flavonoid constituents. Although the flavonoid\ndata for some species are lacking, those available appear to be very\nuseful for species delimitation and for recognizing species\nrelationships in the section. Most species of section Echinocaulon are\nreadily distinguished by their flavonoid profiles, and the cladogram\nbased on nine flavonoid characters suggests four basic chemical lineages\nin the section.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygonum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4240.phy"}]}
