The nomenclature and classification\nstatus of PmNV has been changed several times due to morphological\nobservation and phylogenetic analysis of its partial genome sequence. In\nthis study, we therefore completed the genome sequence and constructed\nphylogenetic trees to clarify PmNVâs taxonomic position. To better\nunderstand the characteristics of the occlusion bodies formed by this\nmarine occluded virus, we also compared the chemical properties of the\npolyhedrin produced by PmNV and the baculovirus AcMNPV (Autographa\ncalifornica nucleopolyhedrovirus).","trees":[{"tree_label":"LEF protein","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nudiviruses LEF protein","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75733.phy"},{"tree_label":"DNA polymerase","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nudiviruses DNA polymerase","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75655.phy"},{"tree_label":"Helicase","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nudiviruses Helicase","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75656.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nudiviridae","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nudiviruses Nudiviridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75738.phy"},{"tree_label":"Oral infectivity","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nudiviruses Oral infectivity","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75737.phy"}]}
