Cytospora species are difficult to differentiate since the\noverlap morphological characteristics. In the current study, we obtained\nseven representative isolates from six tree hosts of Betulaceae,\nJuglandaceae, Rosaceae, Tiliaceae and Ulmaceae in Mount Dongling of\nChina. Based on morphological comparison and phylogenetic analyses using\npartial ITS, LSU, act, rpb2, tef1-Î± and tub2 gene sequences, we\nidentified two known species (Cytospora leucostoma and C. pruinopsis)\nand two novel species (C. coryleae and C. spiraeicola). These results\nrepresent the first study on Cytospora species associated with canker\ndisease from the Mount Dongling of China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121809.phy"}]}
