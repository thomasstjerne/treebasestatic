A hypothesis of generic relationships in Cyclanthaceae,\nbased on cladistic methods, is presented. Bootstrap analysis and Bremer\nsupport (decay index) have been used to test the strength of individual\nclades, and the result is compared with previously made phylogenetic\nanalyses. The Sphaeradenia group (Chorigyne, Stelestylis, Sphaeradenia,\nand Ludovia) is supported as monophyletic and acceptably resolved, while\nthe Asplundia group (remaining genera in Carludovicoideae) may be\nparaphyletic, with largely uncertain relationships. A formal recognition\nof these groups is therefore not justifed. The probable character\nevolution in Carludovicoideae is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3C","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_684.phy"}]}
