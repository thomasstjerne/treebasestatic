Hypocrea britdaniae, a fungus with unknown anamorph and large,\nconspicuous stromata resembling basidiomata of a corticiaceous fungus,\nis a sister species to the Longibrachiatum clade, while H. foliicola, a\nleaf-dwelling species that forms pulvinate stromata, is recognized as an\nadditional member of the pachybasium core group. Hypocrea foliicola\nsporulates in culture in a reduced verticillium-like manner, while it\nproduces a white, typical pachybasium-like anamorph in nature.\nEcologically H. foliicola is remarkable in inhabiting leaves, a\nsubstrate rarely recorded for Hypocrea. All relevant morphological\nteleomorphic and anamorphic traits are given. The phylogenetic placement\nof the new species within Hypocrea/Trichoderma was determined with\ncombined analyses of rpb2 and tef1 exon sequences","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Hypocrea britdaniae and H. foliicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51990.phy"}]}
