Cladistic analysis of\nrestriction site characters produced one most parsimonious tree;\nadditional accessions screened were shown to be most closely related to\nthe primary accession for each species. No synapomorphy was found to\nunite Corallorhiza. The same topology resulted when deletion characters\nwere added and indicates that deletions in the region of rpo and psa\ngenes have occurred independently in the C. maculata and C striata\ngroups. Because of the coarse level of resolution in the probing, it is\nnot clear to what extent the genes themselves have been affected. Only\none species, the undeleted C. trifida, has been examined\nphysiologically, and it was found to be photosynthetic. This fact, and\nthe deletion pattern, suggest that species of Corallorhiza may show a\nrange of levels of autotrophy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corallorhiza","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1441.phy"}]}
