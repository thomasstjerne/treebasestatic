Actually, chanterelles as commodities in\nYunnan are consisted of species complex and they mainly belong to\nanother species C. yunnanensis based on systematic taxonomic study.\nAfter restudy on morphological features on holotype of C. yunnanensis\ncharacterized by lots of small basidiospores, we found the fact small\nbasidiospores were produced from young basidiomata. The size of mature\nbasidiospores is normal and similar to the species C. cibarius.\nCombining characteristic observation and phylogenic analysis of nucLSU\nand transcription elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef-1), we make 1):\namendments to original descriptions of C. yunnanensis; 2): clarification\nthat species traditionally called “C. cibarius” widely distributes in\nsouthwestern China belongs to C. yunnanensis; 3): confirmation the\nexistence of the species C. cibarius only in northeastern China; and 4):\nsuggestion the name Cantharellus yunnanensis W.F. Chiu should be\nreserved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106051","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106051.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106052","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106052.phy"}]}
