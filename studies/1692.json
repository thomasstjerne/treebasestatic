We distinguished between these two\nhypotheses by constructing a robust multigene phylogeny and estimating\nthe dates of divergence among four, monophyletic species of smut fungi\n(Ustilago maydis, U. scitaminea, Sporisorium reilianum, S. sorghi) known\nto specifically infect maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and their wild\nancestors. Without a fossil record for smut fungi, we calibrated the\npathogen species’ divergence times to their plant host divergence times.\nSpecifically, a calibration date of 10,000 years was employed to test\nthe hypothesis that the fungal species originated at the time of\ndomestication of their current hosts and a calibration date of 50\nmillion years was employed to test the hypothesis that the fungal\nspecies originated on wild ancestors of their domesticated hosts.\nSubstitution rates at five protein coding genes were calculated and\nrates obtained for the 10,000 year calibration date were orders of\nmagnitude faster than those commonly reported for eukaryotes, thus\nrejecting the hypothesis that these smut pathogen species diverged at\nthe time of domestication. In contrast, substitution rates obtained for\nthe 50 million year calibration were comparable to eukaryotic\nsubstitution rates. We used the 50 million year calibration to estimate\ndivergence times of taxa in two datasets, one comprised solely of the\nfocal species and one comprised of the focal species and additional\nrelated taxa. Both datasets indicate that all taxa diverged millions of\nyears ago, strongly supporting the hypothesis that smut species diverged\nbefore the time of domestication and modern agriculture. Thus, smut\nspecies diverged in the ecological context of natural host plant and\nfungal populations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ATP6","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_331.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Combined","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4715.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4716.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COX3","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4711.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 EF1a","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4712.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 GAPDH","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4713.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 RPB1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Smut Pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4714.phy"}]}
