Basidiomes of this species are characterized by having hyphae\nsometimes with clamp connections at the septa, basidia without clamp\nconnections at the basal septa, and ellipsoid to ovoid basidiospores\nmeasuring 4.56 × 34.5 µm. In culture, mycelia produce pale brown,\norange-brown to brown, globose sclerotia measuring 0.240.41 mm diam. The\nsclerotia are distinctly different in shape and size from those of other\nAthelia species, and are occasionally found inside the woody substrate\nbeneath basidiomes. They are identical in shape and size to those of\nFibularhizoctonia sp., also known as termite balls. Phylogenetic\nanalysis using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data revealed\nthat A. termitophila is the teleomorph of Fibularhizoctonia sp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Athelia termitophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121519.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Athelia termitophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121520.phy"}]}
