However,\nlife cycle and distribution of this species are not sufficiently\nclarified in China. Its heteroecious life cycle alternating between\nspermogonial and aecial stages on A. holophylla and uredinial and telial\nstages on Populus pseudosimonii is confirmed for the first time in China\nby inoculations and phylogenetic analyses. The identity of these stages\nwith M. abietis-populi is also confirmed by comparative morphology with\nspecimens from Japan and phylogenetic analyses. These plants are new\nhosts for this species. Host plants and distribution of this species in\nChina are described based on specimens obtained from the field and\ninoculations. Phylogenetic position of this species among Melampsora\nspecies is clarified for first time. Based on morphological similarities\nand phylogenetic analyses, M. nujiangensis reported on Populus\nyunnanensis is treated as a synonym of M. abietis-populi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132754.phy"}]}
