Maximum parsimony and\nBayesian analyses of chloroplast DNA sequences (trnL-trnF and trnG\nregions) were undertaken to assess the affinities between these\ncucullate-leaved species. Syntrichia kingii is described, illustrated\nand its distribution mapped. The range of this species is extended in\nthe Neotropics to Guatemala, Mexico and Venezuela. Diagnostic\ncharacters, microphotographs and a morphological comparison with S.\npercarnosa are provided. Syntrichia percarnosa is excluded from Mexican\nmoss flora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 bayesian tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65316","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_65316.phy"}]}
