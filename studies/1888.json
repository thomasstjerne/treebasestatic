During routine surveillance of eucalypt taxa\ntrials in Northern Queensland symptoms resembling K. destructans were\nobserved on E. grandis and E. grandis x E. camaldulensis. Phylogenetic\nand morphological studies revealed a new pathogen K. viscida, which is\nclosely related to K. destructans. While E. grandis from the Copperload\nprovenance recovered from disease, hybrids from South America were\nhighly susceptible to K. viscida, and are consequently not suitable for\nplanting in northern Queensland. Preliminary results from the present\nstudy suggest this fungus probably originates from Australia. The fact\nthat K. viscida is closely related to K. destructans suggests the\npossible impact of disease to Australian eucalypt plantations could be\ndevastating.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BT BS","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2864.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2865.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF BS","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2866.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2867.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BS","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2868.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kirramyces viscidus sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2869.phy"}]}
