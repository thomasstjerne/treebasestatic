Their vermiform shape and four\nswimming flaps are difficult to relate to the features of other\ncnidarians, thus obscuring their phylogenetic affinities. Since their\ndiscovery in the mid-1800s, a number of prominent cnidarian workers have\nweighed in on this conundrum, some arguing that they are aberrant\nhydrozoans and others concluding that they are unusual scyphozoans.\nCurrent taxonomic practice conforms to the latter view. However, data\npresented here from the large and small subunits of the nuclear ribosome\nleave little doubt that Tetraplatia is in fact a hydrozoan genus.\nIndeed, its precise phylogenetic position is within Narcomedusae, as\nsome authors had previously deduced based on structural characters. The\ndistinctive body plan of Tetraplatia is remarkable because it appears to\nhave a recent origin, in contrast to the prevailing pattern of metazoan\nhistory.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplatia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2314.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplatia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2315.phy"}]}
