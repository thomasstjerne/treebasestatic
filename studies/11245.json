Whereas maximum parsimony analysis provided high support for\nTimmia section Norvegica, T. comata, and a clade with T. sibirica plus\nT. norvegica, the relationships among specimens with morphologies of the\nlatter two taxa could be resolved only by means of haplotype networks.\nThe haplotype network based on 26S distinguishes T. sibirica from T.\nnorvegica, whereas the two chloroplast markers do not. Based on the 26S\ndifferences and morphological evidence, T. sibirica and T. norvegica are\nconsidered different at the species level. Timmia comata is resolved in\na haplotype network separate from that of T. norvegica plus T. sibirica.\nIn combination with the high Bootstrap support of the clade with T.\ncomata specimens and their morphological distinctness from T. norvegica,\nthis provides very high support for its recognition as a distinct\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus tree","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Timmia norvegica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_29827.phy"}]}
