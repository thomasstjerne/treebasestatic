The first\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA was\nsequenced in twenty populations of A. hippolyti. The resulting\nphylogeography can be interpreted in the light of geological data and\nsuggests that the species has undergone an initial, allopatric\ndifferentiation into three subspecies during the Pliocene or the late\nMiocene, followed by a later range expansion, the formation of hybrid\nzones, and a range reduction in the Pleistocene. At least one more\nsubspecies may have evolved during the latter period. The taxon\narthuriana might have been inappropriately classified as an A. hippolyti\nsubspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albinaria hippolyti","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4377.phy"}]}
