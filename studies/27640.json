Phylogenetic analyses using comparisons of DNA sequence data for\nthe internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (ITS), translation\nelongation factor 1-α (TEF), ß-tubulin (TUB), histone (HIS), and\ncalmodulin (CAL) gene regions, as well as their morphological features\nrevealed two novel taxa, D. zaofenghuang and D. jinxiu and five known\nspecies, D. eres, D. caryae, D. hongkongensis, D. unshiuensis and D.\ncercidis. The current study improves the understanding of species\ncausing constriction canker and provides useful information for the\neffective disease management of peach in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132050.phy"}]}
