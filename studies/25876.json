Both species have\nmorphological similarities to E. muricatus and E. granulatus; however,\nthe former has a gleba without a purplish color and the latter has\nreticulated ascospores more closely resembling E. asperulus. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses also support the assignment of these specimens as\nnew species. ITS rDNA homologies with known species were low (< 91%\nand < 97%). In addition, phylogenetic trees using neighbor-joining\nand maximum likelihood methods showed that the sequences of the two new\nspecies each formed a monophyletic group within section Elaphomyces with\nbootstrap support of 99%. Analyses of ectomycorrhizal roots collected\nconcurrently with the ascomata revealed that E. marmoratus is associated\nwith at least Pinus densiflora, while E. fuscus is associated with at\nleast Q. serrata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Section Elaphomyces using ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122499.phy"}]}
