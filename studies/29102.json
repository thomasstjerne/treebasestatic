In the present study, we\nfirstly reported two new species of Capillidium from China. Capillidium\nmacrocapilliconidium sp. nov. is characterised by its larger\ncapilliconidia compared to other Capillidium species. Capillidium\ntianwangense sp. nov. is mostly allied to Ca. denaeosporum, but it\ndiffers from its larger capilliconidia, longer primary conidiophores and\nslender secondary conidiophores. Phylogenetic analysis based on the\nnuclear large subunit of rDNA (nucLSU), the mitochondrial small subunit\nof rDNA (mtSSU) and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene\n(TEF1) obtained robust support for these two new species. Additionally,\na new combination of Capillidium rugosum (Drechsler) B. Huang & Y.\nNie comb. nov. was proposed. An identification key is provided for the\nten accepted Capillidium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135183.phy"}]}
