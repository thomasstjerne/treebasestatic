Traditionally, polyploidy has been considered\nan evolutionary dead-end, whereas recent genomic studies suggest that\npolyploidy has been a key driver of macro-evolutionary success. Here we\nexamine the consequences of polyploidy on the time scale of genera\nacross a diverse set of vascular plants, encompassing hundreds of\ninferred polyploidization events. Likelihood-based analyses indicate\nthat polyploids generally exhibit lower speciation rates and higher\nextinction rates than diploids, providing the first quantitative\ncorroboration of the dead-end hypothesis. The increased speciation rates\nof diploids can, in part, be ascribed to their capacity to speciate via\npolyploidy. Only particularly “fit” lineages of polyploids may persist\nto enjoy longer term evolutionary success.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bioperl 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dryopteris NA Sessa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bioperl 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheilanthes Myriopteris Grusz","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48159.phy"}]}
