Some authors have proposed\nthe use of divergence time as a universally standardized criterion.\nAgaricus (Agaricaceae, Agaricales) is a mushroom genus that contains\nmany species of high commercial value. Recent studies using ITS sequence\ndata discovered eleven new phylogenetic lineages within the genus,\nhowever their taxonomic ranks were uncertain due to the lack of criteria\nto define them within traditional taxonomy. In this study, we analyzed\nITS sequence data from 745 collections (nearly 600 being newly\ngenerated) including 81 from type specimens of previously recognized\nsubgenera and sections. Many monophyletic groups were recognized, but\nmost basal relationships were unresolved. One hundred and fourteen\nrepresentatives of the identified ITS clades were selected in order to\nproduce a multi-gene phylogeny based on combined LSU, tef-1α, and rpb2\nsequence data. Divergence times within the multi-gene phylogeny were\nestimated using BEAST v1.8. Based on phylogenetic relationships and with\nrespect to morphology, we propose a revised taxonomic system for\nAgaricus that considers divergence time as a standardized criterion for\nestablishing taxonomic ranks. We propose to segregate Agaricus into five\nsubgenera and 20 sections. Subgenus Pseudochitonia is substantially\nemended; circumscription of the subgenera Agaricus and Flavoagaricus is\nrestricted to taxa of sections Agaricus and Arvenses, respectively; and\ntwo new subgenera (Minores and Spissicaules) are introduced. Within\nPseudochitonia, sections Bivelares, Brunneopicti, Chitonioides,\nNigrobrunnescentes, Sanguinolenti and Xanthodermatei are maintained, but\nthe latter two are reduced because we raise their respective subsections\nBohusia and Hondenses to sectional rank; and sections Rubricosi,\nCrassispori, Flocculenti, and Amoeni are introduced. Section\nLaeticolores is placed in the subgenus Minores and sections Rarolentes\nand Subrutilescentes are placed in the subgenus Spissicaules. Twenty-two\nnew species belonging to various sections are described. This work\nexemplifies that ITS data, while useful at lower taxonomic levels (i.e.,\ndetection of species and species groups), are of limited value for\ninferring deeper phylogenetic relationships. Finally, we suggest that\nthe establishment of a standardized taxonomic system based on divergence\ntimes could result in a more objective, and biologically more\nmeaningful, taxonomic ranking of fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92920.phy"}]}
