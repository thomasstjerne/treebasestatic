A phylogenetic analysis of\nmorphological characters of the genitalia and the shell showed that the\nmorphological characters are insufficient for resolving the\nrelationships within the Caucasigenini. Convergences of the few\nparsimony informative characters in other groups of the Hygromiidae\ndemonstrate that these characters are not reliable indicators of\nphylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of cox1,\n16S rDNA, 5.8S rDNA, ITS2 and 28S rDNA revealed several well-supported\ngroups. The relationships between these groups could not be resolved. It\nis likely that these groups originated in a rapid radiation during the\nuplift of the Caucasus. Based on the molecular phylogeny, we propose a\nnew classification of the species of the Caucasigenini and establish a\nnew genus, Lazicana gen. n.","trees":[{"tree_label":"0","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caucasigenini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105799.phy"}]}
