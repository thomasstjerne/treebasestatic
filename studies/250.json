Phylogenetic analyses produced four most\nparsimonious trees that differ only in the positions of three genera\n(Athrotaxis, Taxodium, and Taiwania) and the degree of resolution of a\ntrichotomy within Cupressaceae s. str. Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae form\na monophyletic group. The major lineages of Taxodiaceae diverged first,\nand a monophyletic Cupressaceae s. str. are derived from within\nTaxodiaceae. These results are consistent with recent suggestions that\nthe two families be treated as a single family, Cupressaceae s.l.\nSciadopitys, often classified in Taxodiaceae, is not closely related to\nCupressaceae s.l. and should be excluded from the family. Sequence\nevolution of rbcL is extremely slow in this group of long-lived trees.\nThe rate of silent nucleotide substitutions is 2.5 x 10^(-11) per site\nper year, approximately 13 times slower than rates estimated in\nshort-lived monocots.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxodiaceae & Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1306.phy"}]}
