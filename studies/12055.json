Previous studies have helped to establish the\nmonophyly of Melanesian Schefflera, but an informal, morphology-based\nclassification system that recognizes five subgeneric groupings within\nthis clade remains largely untested. To examine relationships among\nMelanesian Scheffleras, DNA sequence data from two spacer regions (ITS\nand ETS) of the nuclear rRNA genes were gathered from a nearly\ncomprehensive sample of species and analyzed phylogenetically. Results\nconfirm the monophyly of four of the five informal groupings, including\n‘Plerandra’ (from Fiji, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, and New Guinea),\n‘Gabriellae’ (from New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu), ‘Canacoschefflera’\n(New Caledonia), and ‘Dictyophlebes’ (Fiji and Solomon Islands).\nHowever, rDNA data do not agree with morphology in regard to the fifth\ngroup, ‘Dizygotheca’, which appears polyphyletic in the cladograms based\non ITS and ETS sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"159","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49270","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49270.phy"}]}
