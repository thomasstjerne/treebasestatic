In the\npresent study, DNA sequences from six plastid markers (atpB, rbcL, rps4,\nrps4-trnS, trnL and trnL-F) of 1030 accessions (616 of them newly\nsequenced here) representing c.420 species of Asplenium (60% of\nestimated species diversity), 16 species of Hymenasplenium, three\nDiplaziopsidaceae, and four Rhachidosoraceae were used to produce the\nlargest genus-level phylogeny yet for ferns. Our major results include:\n(i) Asplenium as broadly circumscribed is monophyletic based on our\ninclusion of representatives of 32 of 38 named segregate genera; (ii) 11\nmajor clades in Asplenium are identified, and their relationships are\nmostly well-resolved and strongly supported; (iii) numerous species,\nunsampled in previous studies, suggest new relationships and numerous\ncryptic species and species complexes in Asplenium; and (iv) the accrued\nmolecular evidence provides an essential foundation for further\ninvestigations of complex patterns of geographical diversification,\nspeciation and reticulate evolution in this family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1030","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118290","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118290.phy"}]}
