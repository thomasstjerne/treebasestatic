Carollia manu was\ndescribed in 2004 and is distributed in montane forests in southern Peru\nand Bolivia. The phylogenetic affinities of C. manu have never been\nassessed before. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b sequences of\nseven of the eight known species of the genus place C. manu sister to C.\nsubrufa. The analyses also suggest hidden diversity in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"best","ntax":"167","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carollia cytochrome b","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68905.phy"}]}
