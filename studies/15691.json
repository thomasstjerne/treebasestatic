We re-examined these isolates using phylogenetical and\nmorphological analysis. In a detailed phylogenetic analysis of all clade\nmembers that was based on the sequences of eight genomic regions (rDNA\nlarge subunit [LSU], translation elongation factor 1 alpha [EF1-α],\nβ-tubulin, 60S ribosomal protein L10 [60SL10], heat shock protein 90\n[HSP90], triosephosphate isomerase/ glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase [tigA], cox1), Easter lily isolates formed a monophyletic\ngroup with high bootstrap support. The unique colony pattern supported\nthis result. In separate analyses of Phytophthora clade 8 based on rDNA\nITS and the cox1 gene, the lettuce isolates grouped with P. lactucae\n(described from lettuce in Greece) in the rDNA ITS tree but formed a\ndistinct group in the cox1 tree. The sporangia of Japanese lettuce\nisolates germinated directly, an uncommon feature in clade 8b. These\nresults suggested that the Easter lily and lettuce isolates are novel\nspecies that we formally describe as Phytophthora lilii sp. nov. and P.\npseudolactucae sp. nov., respectively. Moreover, P. lilii appears to\nrepresent a new Phytophthora clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora spp. from lily","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74561.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora spp. MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75313.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora spp. from lettuce ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74434.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora spp. from lily","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74560.phy"}]}
