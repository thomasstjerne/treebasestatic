{"Authors":" Qian Chen, Y. C. Dai","Year":" 2018","Title":" Phylogeny and global diversity of the Fuscoporia contigua\ncomplex (Hymenochaetales, Basidiomycota)","Journal":" Persoonia","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Hymenochaetaceae, phylogeny, taxonomy, wood-rotting\nfungi","DOI":"","Abstract":" The genus of Fuscoporia is characterized by resupinate to\npileate basidiocarps, a dimitic hyphal system with encrusted generative\nhyphae both in dissepiment edge and tube trama, the presence of hymenial\nsetae and hyaline, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores. The members of the\nFuscoporia contigua complex are easy to distinguish from other species\nof Fuscoporia because of the mostly large pores, the presence of the\nmycelial setae and large hymenial setae. To explore the relationships\namong the Fuscoporia contigua complex based on morphological and\nphylogenetic perspectives, we examined 87 specimens representing 20\nspecies of Fuscoporia. Seven new species, Fuscoporia aridicola, F.\ncentroamericana, F. costaricana, F. latispora, F. monticola, F.\nseptoseta and F. sinica, are described from China, Costa Rica, Mexico\nand USA. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from the nLSU sequences and the\nITS + nLSU sequences indicate that Fuscoporia contigua complex is a\ndistinct clade within Fuscoporia and so far comprises nine species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
