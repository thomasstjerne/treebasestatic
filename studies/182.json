Helianthus and three outgroup species were assessed by\nrestriction site mapping of the 1 8S-25S nuclear ribosomal RNA gene\nfamily. Wagner parsimony analysis of the 41 restriction site or length\nmutations observed produced a single 59-step most parsimonious tree.\nThis tree was then compared to a cytoplasmic-based plastid phylogeny for\nthis group. Several major discrepancies were observed between the two\nphylogenies suggesting both recent and ancient introgression.\nFurthermore, three cases of diploid hybrid speciation are unambiguously\ndocumented and a fourth case is suggested. These data are interpreted to\nsuggest that evolution in Heliathus is reticulate rather than\nexclusively dichotomous and branching.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helianthus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4254.phy"}]}
