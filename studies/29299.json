Diatrype larissae from Heilongjiang Provinces is\ncharacterised by having 36 perithecia in a stroma, asci polysporous,\nascospores allantoid, aseptate, slightly or moderately curved,\nsubhyaline. Diatrype betulaceicola has large stroma with 514\nperi-thecia, perithecium immersed, asci polysporous, long-stalked,\nascospores allantoid, aseptate, slightly curved, subhyaline. The\nphylogenies inferred from the data set of nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS)\nand beta-tubulin (β-tubulin) supported the two new species as members in\nthe genus Diatrype and distinct species. The morphological similarities\nand dissimilarities of the new species with phylogenetically close\nalliances are discussed. A dichotomous identification key to the\nDiatrype spp. known from China is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135219","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135219.phy"}]}
