Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS and SSU rDNA sequences,\nperformed by the neighbour joining and maximum parsimony methods,\nrevealed that the Stemphylium spp. were phylogenetically distinct from\nthe Alternaria and Ulocladium spp. Most Alternaria spp. and the\nUlocladium spp. were placed together in a large Alternaria/Ulocladium\nclade. Within this large clade, the Alternaria spp. clustered into\nseveral distinct species-clades, most of which correlated with\nspecies-groups previously established based upon morphological\ncharacteristics. The Ulocladium spp. were placed into two\nspecies-clades, each of which also included Alternaria spp. A.\nlongissima was distantly related to the other Alternaria spp., as well\nas the Ulocladium and Stemphylium spp. Based upon ITS and nuclear 18S\nrDNA sequence identities, A. longissima was most closely related to\nLeptosphaeria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3600.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3601.phy"}]}
