Dothiorella vidmadera sp. nov. is most closely related to D.\niberica, D. americana and D. sarmentorum, but differs in morphological\ncharacters and DNA sequences. All four species are known to be\nassociated with Botryosphaeria dieback of grapevines. Additionally, an\nunidentified ascomycete isolated from dead wood of grapevines in Western\nAustralia is described. Phylogenetically, strains were most closely\nrelated to Spencermartinsia viticola, and bore conidia with\nmorphological characters and dimensions consistent with published\ndescriptions. However, ascospores were shorter and narrower than\npreviously reported and lacked the terminal apiculi that typify the\ngenus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia 1 of 16 MPTs obtained\nfrom the combined ITS, TEF and BT sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62233.phy"}]}
