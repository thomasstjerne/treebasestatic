Biscogniauxia taxa\nformed a well-supported clade that was basal to the other taxa, while\ntaxa of Hypoxylon and Daldinia comprised a large monophyletic group that\ncontained two subclades. The first subclade encompassed Hypoxylon sect.\nAnnulata and is accepted here as the new genus Annulohypoxylon. The\nsecond subclade contained taxa of Hypoxylon sect. Hypoxylon and\nDaldinia. Hypoxylon is restricted to include only those taxa in sect.\nHypoxylon. Thirty-three epithets are made in Annulohypoxylon. Hypoxylon\ncohaerens var. microsporum is raised to the species level and accepted\nas A. minutellum. Hypoxylon polyporoideum is recognized as distinct from\nH. crocopeplum. Hypoxylon placentiforme is accepted as Daldinia\nplacentiformis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6 (unprinted)","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_250.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 (unprinted)","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_653.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2306.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4581.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 (unprinted)","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and closely related genera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4583.phy"}]}
