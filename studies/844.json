Both the\ngenus Cynanchum and the subtribe Metastelminae s.l. split along the Old\nWorld-New World geographic division. The only exception to this division\nis Cynanchum subgenus Mellichampia, which belongs to Cynanchum s. str.\nFor the Old World Cynanchum relatives, the subtribe Cynanchinae is\nre-established. The remaining New World sections of Cynanchum are not\nmonophyletic. The South American members of section Cynanchum join the\nmorphologically aberrant Grisebachiella hieronymi. Section Macbridea is\nassociated with Funastrum. In the Old World, the succulent genera\nFolotsia, Karimbolea, Platykeleba, and Sarcostemma are monophyletic with\nstem-succulent Cynanchum and nested within a clade of exclusively\nMalagasy Cynanchum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum, sequence characters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum, sequence characters and indels","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5671.phy"}]}
