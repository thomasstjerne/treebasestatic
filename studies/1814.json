In this study\nplastid DNA (psbA-trnH, atpB-rbcL, and rpl16) were sampled from across\nthe morphological spectrum of species and analysed using parsimony and\nBayesian inference. The combined results show Diosmeae to be\nmonophyletic and a number of genera to be polyphyletic. These data are\nmostly incongruent with the morphology data and suggest that, together\nwith broader sampling of molecular data, more careful examination of\nmorphological characters is needed prior to the adjustment of generic\ncircumscriptions.
