Here, we study a change in\na haploid dioecious green algal species with male- and femaledetermining\nchromosomes (U and V). The genus Volvox is an oogamous (with large,\nimmotile female gametes and small, motile male gametes) and includes\nboth heterothallic species (with distinct male and female genotypes,\nassociated with a mating-type system that prevents fusion of gametes of\nthe same sex) and homothallic species (bisexual, with the ability to\nself-fertilize). We date the origin of an expanded sex-determining\nregion (SDR) in Volvox to at least 75 Mya, suggesting that homothallism\nrepresents a breakdown of dioecy (heterothallism). We investigated the\ninvolvement of the SDR of the U and V chromosomes in this transition.\nUsing de novo whole-genome sequences, we identified a heteromorphic SDR\nof ca 1 Mbp in male and female genotypes of the heterothallic species\nVolvox reticuliferus and a homologous region (SDLR) in the closely\nrelated homothallic species Volvox africanus, which retained several\ndifferent hallmark features of an SDR. The V. africanus SDLR includes a\nlarge region resembling the female SDR of the presumptive heterothallic\nancestor, whereas most genes from the male SDR are absent. However, we\nfound a multicopy array of the male-determining gene, MID, in a\ndifferent genomic location from the SDLR. Thus, in V. africanus, an\nancestrally female genotype may have acquired MID and thereby gained\nmale traits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125572","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125572.phy"},{"tree_label":"CRB1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125549","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125571","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125559","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125559.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134304.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134303.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134305","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134305.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125569.phy"},{"tree_label":"MTM0637","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125528","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125528.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125567.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134308","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134308.phy"},{"tree_label":"MTM0638","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox MTM0638","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125527.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125558","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125558.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125556","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125556.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134320","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134320.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125551","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125551.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125560","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125560.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134319.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125562","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125562.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125563","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125575","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125553","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125557","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125557.phy"}]}
