Here, a\nphylogenetic analysis for one of the two major clades\n(Rhodocybe-Clitopilus) was conducted using three nuclear protein-coding\ngene regions, the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 6 (atp6), the\nnuclear RNA polymerase subunit II (rpb2) and the nuclear translation\nelongation factor subunit 1-a (tef1). Five monophyletic groups are\nresolved with strong statistical support and a set of morphological\nfeatures for delineation of genera is presented. In the revised\nclassification proposed here, Clitopilus is retained, Rhodocybe is\nemended, two genera previously accepted as synonyms of Rhodocybe\n(Clitopilopsis and Rhodophana) are resurrected and Clitocella is\ndescribed as new.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodocybe-Clitopilus clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77758.phy"}]}
