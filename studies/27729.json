These isolates presented a blastic conidiogenous apparatus and\nyeast-like budding cells typical of the genus Exophiala. DNA sequence\nanalyses of the internal transcribed spacer region and partial large\nsubunit ribosomal RNA gene revealed the presence of a novel species,\nExophiala atacamensis, and a new record, E. crusticola. Exophiala\natacamensis is phylogenetically distant from other members of Exophiala\nand is morphologically characterized by the production of annellidic\nconidiogenous cells, aseptate conidia inJou slimy masses, yeast-like\nbudding cells, and abundant brown, meristematic, thick-walled\nbodies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128962.phy"}]}
