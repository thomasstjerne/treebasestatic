{"Authors":" David M Geiser","Year":" 2020","Title":" Phylogenomic analysis of a 55.1 kb 19-gene dataset resolves a\nmonophyletic Fusarium that includes the Fusarium solani species\ncomplex","Journal":" Phytopathology","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" Scientific communication is facilitated by a data-driven,\nscientifically sound taxonomy that considers the end-user’s needs and\nestablished successful practice. Previously (Geiser et al. 2013;\nPhytopathology 103:400-408. 2013), the Fusarium community nearly\nunanimously voiced support for a concept of Fusarium that represented a\nclade comprising all agriculturally and clinically important Fusarium\nspecies, including the Fusarium solani Species Complex (FSSC).\nSubsequently, this concept was challenged by one research group (Lombard\net al. 2015 Studies in Mycology 80: 189-245), who proposed dividing\nFusarium into seven genera, including the FSSC as the genus\nNeocosmospora, with subsequent justification based on claims that the\nGeiser et al. (2013) concept of Fusarium is polyphyletic (Sandoval-Denis\net al. 2018; Persoonia 41:109-129). Here we test this claim, and provide\na phylogeny based on exonic nucleotide sequences of 19 orthologous\nprotein-coding genes that strongly support the monophyly of Fusarium\nincluding the FSSC. We reassert the practical and scientific argument in\nsupport of a Fusarium that includes the FSSC and several other basal\nlineages, consistent with the longstanding use of this name among plant\npathologists, medical mycologists, quarantine officials, regulatory\nagencies, students and researchers with a stake in its taxonomy. In\nrecognition of this monophyly, 40 species recently described as\nNeocosmospora were recombined in Fusarium, and nine others were renamed\nFusarium. Here the global Fusarium community voices strong support for\nthe inclusion of the FSSC in Fusarium, as it remains the best\nscientific, nomenclatural and practical taxonomic option available.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FSSCIQTree","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium tef1 ITS LSU RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129542.phy"},{"tree_label":"act1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129524.phy"},{"tree_label":"acl1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129523.phy"},{"tree_label":"IQTreeML","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium 19 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129522.phy"},{"tree_label":"mcm7","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129533.phy"},{"tree_label":"lcb2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129532.phy"},{"tree_label":"ku70","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129531.phy"},{"tree_label":"fas2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129530.phy"},{"tree_label":"fas1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129529.phy"},{"tree_label":"dpe1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129528.phy"},{"tree_label":"dpa1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129527.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpr1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129526.phy"},{"tree_label":"cal1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129525.phy"},{"tree_label":"tub2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129541.phy"},{"tree_label":"tub1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129540.phy"},{"tree_label":"tsr1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129539.phy"},{"tree_label":"top1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129538.phy"},{"tree_label":"tef1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129537.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpb2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129536.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpb1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129535.phy"},{"tree_label":"pgk1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129534.phy"}]}
