ITS molecular\nphylogenetic study of Thlaspi aghricum and related species, as well as\nseed-coat morphology and anatomy strongly support the placement of the\nspecies in Noccaea. The new combination N. aghrica is proposed, and\ndetailed description and distribution of the species are given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75127","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75127.phy"}]}
