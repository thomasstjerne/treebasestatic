Phylogenetic relationships within the group are poorly\nunderstood, with between two and fourteen families being recognized on\nmorphological and host taxonomic grounds. We report the first analysis\nof broad-scale relationships within the Uredinales using DNA sequence\ndata from the small subunit gene of the ribosomal RNA operon. A major\nsplit is obvious between genera that have aecial stages on gymnosperm\nhosts and those with this stage on angiosperms. This finding is in\naccord with the early taxonomic two-family treatments of the Uredinales.\nWithin the major clades there is evidence of incongruency with\nmorphologically defined families. Racospermyces Maravalia, Hemileia and\nCaeoma are basal to the major phylogenetic sub-division and probably\nrepresent the most ancient rust lineages. Using these sequence data we\nestimate that the rusts diverged from their closest relatives around 150\nmillion years ago.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Uredinales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1808.phy"}]}
