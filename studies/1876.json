Based on morphological,\nultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic observations, it is concluded\nthat Pl. penniseti is not closely related to the generic type and is\ntherefore transferred to the newly described genus Poakatesthia. The\nview that the genera of downy mildews with pyriform to vesicular\nhaustoria the Bremia-clade (Basidiophora, Benua, Bremia,\nParaperonospora, Plasmopara, Plasmoverna and Protobremia) include\nspecies parasitic to Poaceae has therefore to be discarded. All of these\ngenera are apparently restricted to dicotyledonous hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"constr 100","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision,Backbone-constrained with\n100% bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_349.phy"},{"tree_label":"unconstr","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision, Unconstrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4884.phy"},{"tree_label":"constr 75","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision, Backbone-constrained\nwith 75% bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4885.phy"},{"tree_label":"constr 80","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision, Backbone-constrained\nwith 80% bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4886.phy"},{"tree_label":"constr 85","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision, Backbone-constrained\nwith 85% bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4887.phy"},{"tree_label":"constr 90","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision, Backbone-constrained\nwith 90% bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 constr 95","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plasmopara penniseti revision","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4889.phy"}]}
