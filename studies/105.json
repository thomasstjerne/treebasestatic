Our results show a well-supported\nsister-group relationship for Trochodendron and Tetracentron, and these\ntwo genera form the sister group to other ‘lower’ hamamelids.\nCercidiphyllum and Myrothamnus are resolved as sister taxa and are\nthemselves placed as the sister taxa of Euptelea and Eucommia.\nCercidiphyllum, Myrothamnus, Euptelea, and Eucommia form the sister\ngroup to Platanus and Hamamelidaceae. Hamamelidaceae are shown to be\nmonophyletic and form the sister group to Platanus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1428.phy"}]}
