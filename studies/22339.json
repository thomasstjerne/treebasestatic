The isolates are\nsimilar to L. uredinophilum, which was discovered on a rust fungus in\nKorea. L. uredinophilum is characterized by mycelium immersed in the\nhost, erect conidiophores raised from prostrate hyphae with solitary or\n2-4 whorls of phialides and aseptate, solitary phialides tapering\ntowards the apex, sometimes with secondary produced phialides. Conidia\nadhere in a slimy head at the apex of the phialides and are oval to\ncylindrical and aseptate. Multigene phylogenetic analysis based on the\nconcatenated data set of LSU, SSU, TEF, RPB2, RPB1 and ITS sequences\nshow that these two isolates have a close relationship with L.\nuredinophilum. Therefore, in the study, the two isolates are delineated\nas a new host and geographic record for L. uredinophilum in China","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanicillium uredinophilum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111749.phy"}]}
