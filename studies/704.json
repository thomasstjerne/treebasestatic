A sequence analysis of\nthe internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA\ngenes (including ITSI, 5.8S, ITSII) was performed with 52 of these\nstocks. Phylogenetic trees were generated using neighbor joining and\nparsimony. The outgroup taxa were Hypomyces boletiphagus and\nCladobotryum varium. Our DNA data indicate a subdivision of the\nSepedonium isolates into eight monophyletic taxa, seven of them\nassignable to accepted species. Extensive descriptions are provided for\nall species. One species, S. laevigatum, is described as new. An\nevaluation is presented for the systematic significance of the\ncharacters studied. A morphological key is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sepedonium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5538.phy"},{"tree_label":"unpublished","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sepedonium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5539.phy"}]}
