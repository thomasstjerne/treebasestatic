It is\ncharacterized by the ascospores with an elongated narrow sheath\nproviding arrowhead-like tips. In terms of sheath morphology of\nascospores, L. sagittiforme is similar to some aquatic species of the\ngenus, e.g., L. armatisporum, L. bipolare, L. frondisubmersa, and L.\nproprietunicatum, but differs form these species in having relatively\nlarge-sized ascospores. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal\ntranscribed region (ITS) -5.8S and partial large subunit of the nuclear\nribosomal DNA (LSU nrDNA) also supported the taxonomic classification of\nL. sagittiforme in Lophiostoma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophiostoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_367.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophiostoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1081.phy"}]}
