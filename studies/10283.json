These techniques were used to measure the change in\ndiversity before and after disease decimated the amphibian fauna of\ncentral Panama, and found that 41% of amphibian species diversity was\nlost, including five undescribed species. A DNA-based community\nphylogeny for all amphibian taxa observed before the decline showed that\ndisease extirpated 32% of total phylogenetic diversity of amphibians.\nBecause the direction and spread of disease was predicted, we were able\nto follow the impact and phylogenetic pattern of evolutionary loss from\nan entire community following epidemic disease and mass\nextirpation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cope community phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6839.phy"}]}
