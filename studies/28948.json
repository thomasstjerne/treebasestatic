Genuina play important roles in forest\necosystem. However, subtle morphological characters make it difficult to\nclarify the species diversity of this section. In this study, two new\nspecies of T. sect. Genuina collected from southwestern China are\ndescribed with both molecular phylogenetic and morphological evidence.\nTricholoma fulvomaculatum is characterized by its viscid, red-brown\npileus, rusty spots on the surface of the yellow lamellae, white base of\nthe stipe and ellipsoid basidiospores, while T. rufobrunneum is featured\nby its dry, red-brown, squamous pileus and stipe, and its distribution\nin subalpine coniferous forests between 3600 and 3700 m altitude.\nBesides, known distribution ranges of T. sinoacerbum, originally\ndescribed from southern China, are largely extended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML analysis based on ITS dataset","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134306.phy"}]}
