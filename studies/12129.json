Some studies indicate that the\ndifference in mating behavior between winged and wingless queens may\npromote genetic isolation, possibly leading to speciation. However, the\nknowledge about genetic differences and phylogenetic relationships among\npolymorphic queens is limited. Queens of the myrmicine ant Vollenhovia\nemeryi exhibit two morphs: a long-winged (L-queen) and a short-winged\n(S-queen) morph. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among\npopulations of L- and S-queens in V. emeryi and the congeneric species\nV. nipponica, V. benzai, V. okinawana, and V. yambaru. The molecular\nphylogeny inferred from mtDNA (ca. 2200 nt) showed that S-queens formed\na monophyletic clade and that L- and S- queens sampled from the same\nlocation did not group together. The phylogeny indicates that wing\nreduction occurred only once and that S-queen populations are\ngenetically differentiated from L-queen populations at least in their\nmaternal genomes. The phylogeny is consistent with the hypothesis that\nwing reduction leads to reproductive isolation in V. emeryi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vollenhovia ants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49736.phy"}]}
