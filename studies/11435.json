We assumed that the high genetic\nvariations might have been due to effects of refugia, secondary\nadmixture, or massive anthropogenic introductions. Molecular\nphylogenetic (Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches) and\nnetwork (Median joining method) analyses clarified that sables in\nHokkaido constituted a monophyly. Bayesian-relaxed molecular dating\napproach estimated the date for migration of sables into Hokkaido to lie\nbetween 0.10-0.27 Myr BP. Considering the geological evidence, Late\nPleistocene was presumed to be the plausible epoch for the establishment\nof the sables in Hokkaido. Lower genetic diversity of the sables in\nHokkaido observed in this study was probably caused by the foundation\neffects or anthropogenic factors. Mammalian faunal construction in\nHokkaido was also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"zibellinaML","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Martes zibellina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43770.phy"}]}
