Based on cpDNA data,\nMentha is strongly supported as monophyletic. The suggestions that M.\ncervina and M. cunninghamii should be placed in other genera gain no\nsupport from this analysis. Mentha cervina is sister to M. gattefossei,\nand the New Zealand endemic, M. cunninghamii, is allied with species\nfrom Australia (M. australis, M. diemenica, M. satureioides). No\nrecognized section with more than one species sampled forms a\nmonophyletic group. Section Pulegium may be monophyletic, but the third\nmember of this section, M. grandiflora, was not sampled. Chloroplast DNA\nsequences of the putative allopolyploids M. canadensis and M. spicata\nsuggest that M. arvensis and M. longifolia, respectively, may be their\nmaternal parents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1823.phy"}]}
