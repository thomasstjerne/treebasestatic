The\nancestral symbiotic condition for all plants is, nonetheless, widely\nassumed to be arbuscular mycorrhizal with Glomeromycota fungi. Due to a\nrecent report of other fungi in some non-vascular plants, here we\ninvestigate the fungi associated with diverse hornworts using electron\nmicroscopy and molecular phylogenetics. We found that both Glomeromycota\nand Mucoromycotina fungi can form symbioses with most hornworts\nworldwide, often simultaneously. This discovery indicates that ancient\nterrestrial plants relied on a wider and more versatile symbiotic\nrepertoire than previously thought and it highlights the so far\nunappreciated ecological and evolutionary role of Mucoromycotina\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomeromycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61088.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucoromycotina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61087.phy"}]}
