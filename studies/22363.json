They play an important role in the\nturnover of nutrients and minerals and also in bacterial population\ncontrol in nature. Species diversity of these microbes has been surveyed\nglobally, but surveys in Thailand are rare. We collected 73 isolates of\ndictyostelids from soils in two districts of Amnat Charoen Province,\nThailand. The majority of dictyostelids recovered from Amnat Charoen\nProvince belong to the genus Dictyostelium, with 48.0%. The 5Â’-end of the\n18S rDNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Sanger sequencing\napproach. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using three different\nmethods. These were neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML) and\nBayesian inference (BI). The resulting phylogeny suggests that five\ngenera of dictyostelids (Cavenderia, Heterostelium, Raperostelium,\nDictyostelium and Polysphondylium) were found in Amnat Charoen Province,\nwith Dictyostelium as the dominant group. These data are the first on\nthe phylogenetic diversity of dictyostelids in north-eastern Thailand\nand will be useful in the management of natural and microbial\nresources.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyostelids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110427.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyostelids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110428.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyostelids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110429.phy"}]}
