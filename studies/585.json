In separate analyses with each gene, Calostoma was\nplaced within the Boletales and outside the clades containing most\ngilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns\nand nonboletalean Gasteromycetes. This contradicted previous taxonomic\nhypotheses. Calostoma was most closely related to Gyroporus, Pisolithus,\nand Scleroderma based on maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood\nanalysis of the mitochondrial large ribosomal gene database, which\ncontained several representatives of most genera of the Boletales. In\nthree of the four gene trees Calostoma shows an unusually high number of\ninferred nucleotide substitutions relative to other Boletales; this\ncorresponds to its extreme morphological divergence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ALL-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3533.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MS-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3531.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3532.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SSU-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3529.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3530.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3-SET","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3534.phy"}]}
