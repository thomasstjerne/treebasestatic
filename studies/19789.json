However, foliar fungal pathogens, like switchgrass rust,\nhave the potential to significantly reduce switchgrass biomass yield.\nDespite its importance as a prominent bioenergy crop, a genome-wide\ncomprehensive analysis of NB-LRR disease resistance genes has yet to be\nperformed in switchgrass.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"694","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panicum virgatum PvBd 694 NBLRR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98901.phy"}]}
