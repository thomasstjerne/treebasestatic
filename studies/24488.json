Besides producing yellow spots on\ntheir hosts such as Entyloma spp. members of Kordyana also produce naked\nhymenia on the surface of the foliar tissue of their hosts and produce\nballistosporic basidiospores with hilar appendixes obliquely oriented in\nrelation to the apex of basidia. In the present study, the morphology\nand phylogenetic relationships of a Kordyana found on Commelina obliqua\nbased on specimens collected from two localities of different Brazilian\nstates led to the clear conclusion that it represented a novel addition\nto the genus Kordyana which is described herein. This is the second\nmember of the genus described in Brazil (K. brasiliensis being the\nfirst). Another species of Kordyana was collected in Tripogandra\ndiuretica and through our analyzes we conclude that it is K. celebensis.\nThis is the first report of K. celebensis occurring in T. diuretica in\nBrazil and in the world. A discussion on the relationship between this\nspecies with other members of the genus and on the placement of Kordyana\nin the Exobasidiaceae is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118282.phy"}]}
