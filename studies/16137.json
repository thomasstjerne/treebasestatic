Phylogenetic hypotheses\nwere derived from maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony analyses of a\nthree gene concatenated dataset, including cytochrome c oxidase subunit\n1 (640bp), cytochrome b (1140bp) and exon 3 of the\nrecombination-activating gene 1 (~1500bp). Our investigation provides\nstrong support for the monophyly of two species groups of Psilorhynchus\n(the P. balitora and P. nudithoracicus species groups) and corroborates\nprevious hypotheses on the phylogenetic position of the Western Ghats\nspecies P. tenura based on morphology. Basal relationships within\nPsilorhynchus were poorly supported and are worthy of further\ninvestigation. A fossil calibrated relaxed molecular clock estimates the\nsplit between Psilorhynchus and its sister group to have occurred within\nthe Eocene/Oligocene, with subsequent diversification in the\nMiocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ Result","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psilorhynchus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80992.phy"}]}
