The discovery of Bonitasaura salgadoi, a\npartial titanosaurian skeleton including cranial bones, permitted the\ndefinitive recognition of square jaws in a titanosaurian sauropod as\nwell as a peculiar skull morphology that increases the morphological\ndiversity of the group. Here we present a full description and\nillustration of the skull material of B. salgadoi. Among cranial bones,\nthe lacrimal, quadrate, and dentary exhibit apomorphic differences from\nthose of other titanosaurians. Conversely, the frontal and parietal are\nmore conservative. Aphylogenetic analysis recovers B. salgadoi as a\nmember of the Titanosauria, related to mid-sized to large titanosauroids\nfrom the Turonian-Campanian of South America, in contrast to a previous\nhypothesis that suggested a nemegtosaurid affinity. The skull\nreconstruction presented here shows that the skull of B. salgadoi is\nanteroposteriorly short and dorsoventrally high, contrasting with the\nelongate skull of Rapetosaurus krausei.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sauropoda results","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55319.phy"}]}
