Characterization based on\nmorphological, physiological and molecular data (5.8S and LSU rDNA\nsequences) was carried out. The phylogenetic analyses of the isolates\nrevealed that they belong to the Lichtheimiaceae and are closely related\nto species of Lichtheimia. The two isolates produced simple or branched,\nerect and circinate sporophores, occasionally with a septum under\nsporangia, characteristics also common in Lichtheimia species. However,\ndifferent from the described Lichtheimia species, the columellae of our\nisolates were mainly short hemispherical, never spatulate or elliptical\nand with no projections. Sometimes, a long conical or bell shaped\napophysis was found. Both isolates grew better at 30-35ÂºC, with no\ndevelopment at 42ÂºC, and giant cells were not observed. Based on the\nevidences of the analyzed datasets a new species of Lichtheimia is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Lichtheimia 5.8s bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63109.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Lichtheimia 5.8s ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63110.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichtheimia 5.8s MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63111.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichtheimia 5.8s NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63112.phy"}]}
