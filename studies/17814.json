Comprehensive description, photographs, and comparisons\nwith phenetically similar species are provided. Nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer region (ITS), nuclear ribosomal large\nsubunit (nLSU) and the nuclear second-largest subunit of RNA polymerase\nII (rpb2) gene of this species were sequenced and deposited in GenBank.\nPhylogenetic analysis based on rpb2 sequences using maximum likelihood\n(ML) method confirmed both the novelty of the species and its placement\nwithin the Pseudosperma clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe griseorubida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97445.phy"}]}
