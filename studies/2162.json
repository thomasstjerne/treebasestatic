The additional taxa are mostly from Australasia and other\nregions of the Old World. Bayesian and parsimony analyses support a\nclade, here called the Astioida, representing a large proportion of the\nAustralasian fauna. Included in the Astioida are, for example, the\nrobust-bodied Simaetha and Mopsus, the flattened bark-dweller\nHoloplatys, the delicate foliage-dweller Tauala, the antlike Myrmarachne\nand the litter-dwelling Neon. One astioid, Rhondes neocaledonicus, is\nreturned to that genus from its placement in Hasarius. Another newly\nsupported clade, the Aelurilloida, includes the aelurillines, the\nfreyines, and the Bacelarella group of genera. Other newly delimited\nclades are the Philaeus group (Philaeus, Mogrus, Carrhotus and others),\nthe Leptorchesteae (Leporchestes, Yllenus and Paramarpissa) and the\nHasarieae (Hasarius, Habrocestum and Chinattus). These results concur\nwith previous discoveries (e.g., Amycoida, Marpissoida) in suggesting\nthat salticid clades are largely restricted to continental regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Salticids, Maj Rule from MCMC generations\n10M to 150M","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5318.phy"}]}
