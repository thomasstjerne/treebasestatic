Using an independent dataset of 28S rRNA\nDNA-sequence data, I tested morphology-based hypotheses about these\nrelationships. These data refute the recent placement of the Australian\ngenus Coelocion within the Urocoptidae. Instead, they provide strong\nsupport for a North-American/circum-Caribbean clade, to be named\nUrocoptoidea (new superfamily), which consists of the families\nUrocoptidae and Cerionidae. In all optimal trees (ML, MP and Bayesian),\nCerion is nested among New World Urocoptidae, rather than occupying a\nbasal position as their sister group. Even so, the monophyly of the New\nWorld Urocoptidae could not be statistically rejected. Judging from the\nfossil record, the superfamily Urocoptoidea originated in the\nsouth-western part of the North American continent, where it was\nwidespread by the late Cretaceous. The Antillean Urocoptoidea most\nlikely constitute three separate lineages that may have been carried\neastward on the proto-Antillean island arc, which started in the late\nCretaceous from a position near the SW North-American landmass. Shell\ncharacters used in urocoptid classification are re-evaluated in the\nlight of these results, and consequences for taxonomy and implications\nfor evolutionary research are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 NJ","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3152.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3142.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 MB","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3141.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3143.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3145.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3144.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3146.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 5","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3147.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 6","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3148.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPtree 7","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3149.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3150.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML GTR I G tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocoptidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3151.phy"}]}
