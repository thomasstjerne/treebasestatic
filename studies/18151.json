In this study we include 18 more accessions\nof Neotropical taxa, and analyse in total 123 accessions representing\n115 accessions of Homalomeneae and Philodendreae for the nuclear ITS\nregion together with 42 accessions for the plastid matK region. Results\nsupport resurrection of the genus Adelonema Schott for all Neotropical\nspecies currently assigned to Homalomena. Adelonema is a wholly\nNeotropical genus of sixteen species. Twelve new combinations are made,\nalong with the description of four new species. Adelonema is divided\ninto two sections: section Adelonema and section Curmeria based on\nmorphologically supported molecular results. Adelonema is distinguished\nby an hypogeal rhizome, vegetative tissues smelling of anise (when\ncrushed), an extensively sheathing, sometimes prickly petiole,\nchartaceous often variegated leaf blade, a spadix either obliquely\ninserted on the spathe/peduncle (sect. Adelonema), or stipitate (sect.\nCurmeria), ovaries with 2-4- pluriovulate locules, and anatropous ovules\non a central placenta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Genus Adelonema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90877.phy"}]}
