The result- ing inferences were combined with morphological\ninformation to adopt an integrated approach to resolving the taxonomic\narrangement of the family. The members of the genus Manta were found to\nconsistently nest within the Mobula species and consequently the genus\nManta is placed into the synonymy of Mobula. Mobula eregoodootenkee, M.\njapanica and M. rochebrunei were each found to be junior synonyms of M.\nkuhlii, M. mobular and M. hypostoma, respectively. The mitochondrial and\nnuclear tree topologies were in agreement except for the placement of M.\ntara- pacana which was basal to all other mobulids in the nuclear exon\nanalysis, but as the sister group to the M. alfredi M. birostrisM.\nmobular clade in the mitochondrial genome analysis. Results from this\nstudy are used to a revise the taxonomy for the family Mobulidae. A\nsingle genus is now recognized (where there were previously two) and\neight nominal species (where there were previously 11).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Manta and devilrays","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114302.phy"}]}
