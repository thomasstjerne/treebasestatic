Through ancestral state reconstruction,\nwe also identify morphological synapomorphies of the Tacinga clade,\nwhich further support the relationship of Tacinga and Opuntia lilae. We\nherein transfer Opuntia lilae to the genus Tacinga, making the\ncombination, Tacinga lilae (Trujillo & Ponce) Majure & R.\nPuente. The existence of a species of Tacinga in northeastern Venezuela\nsuggests that members of the Tacinga clade may have previously been more\nwidespread than their current distribution suggests or that members of\nthe Tacinga clade may have been dispersed long distance from the\nCaatinga of Brazil, where Tacinga most likely originated. This study\nillustrates that assumptions regarding regional floristic assemblages\nshould be verified with detailed systematic studies at the clade and\nspecies levels.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tacinga lilae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60941.phy"}]}
