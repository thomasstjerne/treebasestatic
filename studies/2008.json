Most described species are oceanic, and so little\nattention has been devoted to coastal species, the majority of which\nbelong to two families: Pleurochrysidaceae and Hymenomonadaceae. Here,\nwe study the biodiversity and evolutionary relationships within the\nPleurochrysidaceae, for which we have compiled DNA sequences from a\ntotal of 18 strains plus three members of the Hymenomonadaceae. Most of\nthe analysed sequences have been obtained for this study and belong to\nthree genetic fragments: 18S rDNA, elongation factor Tu (tufA), and\ninternal transcribed spacers 1 and 2, which include the 5.8S rDNA. We\nfind some discordance between the current taxonomy of the group and our\nmolecular analyses. First, we observe that several different recognised\nspecies are in fact highly similar taxa, probably belonging to the same\nevolutionary lineages. Secondly, we show some unexpected phylogenetic\nrelationships. In the light of these results, we suggest that, when\npossible, DNA sequences be considered in future taxonomic\nclassifications of the Pleurochrysidaceae and other planktonic\norganisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurochrysidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2992.phy"}]}
