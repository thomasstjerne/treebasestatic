The\ngenus Megaceros, for example, was shown to be polyphyletic with New\nWorld species of the genus nested within Nothoceros. Here we present a\nsampling of most widely recognized species of both genera to provide a\nphylogenetic delimitation of Nothoceros and Megaceros based on the genes\nrbcL and nad5. Nothoceros (including the New World species of Megaceros)\nis monophyletic and restricted to the American continent (except the New\nZealand N. giganteus) and the genus Megaceros is restricted to Asia and\nAustralasia. The three widely accepted American species of Megaceros, M.\naenigmaticus, M. fuegiensis and M. vincentianus are transferred here to\nNothoceros. The lack of defining morphological characters for Nothoceros\ndespite its morphological diversity highlights the need for further\ntaxonomic, morphological and ultrastructural studies of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hornworts, maj rule con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6086.phy"}]}
