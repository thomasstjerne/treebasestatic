Advances in\nbiological and phylogenetic species recognition revealed a rich species\ndiversity which has largely remained understudied. Most of the currently\nrecognised species lack formal descriptions and Latin names, while the\ntaxonomic utility of old names is hampered by the lack of nomenclatural\ntype specimens. Therefore, to stabilise the taxonomy and nomenclature of\nthese important taxa, we examined type specimens and representative\ncultures of several old names by means of morphology and phylogenetic\nanalyses based on rDNA (ITS and LSU), rpb2 and tef1 sequences.\nSixtyeight species are accepted in Neocosmospora, 29 of them described\nherein as new; while 13 new combinations are made. Eleven additional\nphylogenetic species are recognized, but remain as yet undescribed.\nLectotypes are proposed for eight species, seven species are epitypified\nand two species are neotypified. Notes on an additional 17 doubtful or\nexcluded taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocosmospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120822.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocosmospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120823.phy"}]}
