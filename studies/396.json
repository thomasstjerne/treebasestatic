Cladistic analyses of the relationships of the\nanyphaenid genera are made from a selection of 9 exemplar taxa scored\nfor 20 characters. In result, three subfamilies are proposed.\nMalenellinae subfam. n. is erected for Malenella nana gen. & sp.\nn. from southern Chile. This subfamily is considered as the sister group\nof all other anyphaenids. Anyphaeninae and Amaurobioidinae form a\nmonophyletic group united by the orientation of the claw tufi setae and\nthe grooved cymbial tip. Anyphaeninae are diagnosed by three characters\nassociated with the advancement of the spiracle toward the epigastric\nfurrow. Amaurobioidinae are diagnosed by the ingression of the median\nhematodocha in the male tegulum, and a characteristic secondary\nconductor. The relationships among the genera of Amaurobioidinae are\ndiscussed. The complex tracheal system of anyphaenids develops, during\nontogeny, from a simple four-branched system. The genera Aysenia (from\nClubionidae), Philisca (from Miturgidae) and Sanogasta (from Corinnidae)\nare transferred to Anyphaenidae: Amaurobioidinae. M. J.
