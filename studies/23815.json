This soil-borne fungus is\nknown to harbour both pathogenic (plant, animal and human) and\nnon-pathogenic strains. However, in its current concept F. oxysporum is\na species complex consisting of numerous cryptic species. Identification\nand naming these cryptic species is complicated by multiple subspecific\nclassification systems and the lack of living ex-type material to serve\nas basic reference point for phylogenetic inference. Therefore, to\nadvance and stabilise the taxonomic position of F. oxysporum as a\nspecies and allow naming of the multiple cryptic species recognised in\nthis species complex, an epitype is designated for F. oxysporum. Using\nmulti-locus phylogenetic inference and subtle morphological differences\nwith the newly established epitype of F. oxysporum as reference point,\n15 cryptic taxa are resolved in this study and described as\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epitypification of Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115837.phy"}]}
