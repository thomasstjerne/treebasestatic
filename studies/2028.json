Phylogenetic\nanalyses of these data using maximum parsimony, Bayesian, and\nneighbor-joining methods support the monophyly of Ferula upon the\naddition of Dorema and Leutea (as Ferula sensu lato) and its placement\nin tribe Scandiceae. Ferula sensu lato is closely allied with other\nmajor lineages of Scandiceae, corresponding to subtribes Scandicinae,\nDaucinae, and Torilidinae. Therefore, we recognize the Ferula clade as\nsubtribe Ferulinae. Another addition to tribe Scandiceae is a clade\ncomposed of genera Glaucosciadium and Mozaffariania. The three\naccessions of Ferula misplaced in the apioid superclade represent a\nspecies of Silaum","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3014.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scandiceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3015.phy"}]}
