As a\nresult, groups of animals of recent arrival converged into similar\nhabits and formed ecological guilds with some of the endemics. We\npresent a reconstruction of the evolutionary events in Aspidoderidae, a\nfamily of nematodes that infect mammals that are part of this\ninterchange: dasypodids, opossums and sigmodontine, geomyid and\nhystricognath rodents. By treating hosts as discrete states of character\nand using parsimony and Bayesian inferences to optimize these traits\ninto the phylogeny of Aspidoderidae we reconstructed Dasypodidae\n(armadillos) as the synapomorphic host for the family. In addition, 4\nevents of host switching were detected. One consisted of the switch from\ndasypodids to hystricognath rodents, and subsequently to geomyid\nrodents. The remaining set of events consisted of a switch from\ndasypodids to didelphid marsupials and then to sigmodontine rodents. The\nreconstruction of the ancestral distribution suggests 3 events of\nintrogression into the Nearctic. Two of these invasions would suggest\nthat 2 different lineages of dasypodid parasites entered the northern\nhemisphere at different times, which is consistent with the presence of\n2 lineages of armadillos in Mexico.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52825.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS bootstrapParsimony","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52806.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 6","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52827","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52827.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony rrnL 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52792","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52792.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52798.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony rrnL 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52793.phy"},{"tree_label":"MaximumLikelihood rrnL","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52796.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony rrnL 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52794","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52794.phy"},{"tree_label":"BootrtraspParsimony rrnL","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52795.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52800.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesianInference rrnL","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52791.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLbootstrapITS","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52808.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 5","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52802.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 6","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52803.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian InferenceITS","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52797.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 7","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52804.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52799.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 8","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52805.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS parsimony 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52801.phy"},{"tree_label":"MaximumLikelihood ITS","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52807.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52824.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 5","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52826","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52826.phy"}]}
