Previous phylogenies in Commelinaceae have\nemphasized sampling among genera. We extended this previous work by\nsampling multiple species within some of the largest genera of\nCommelinaceae (especially Commelina and Tradescantia , and also\nincluding Callisia , Cyanotis, Gibasis, and Murdannia ), and by\nsequencing noncoding regions both of the nuclear ribosomal DNA region,\n5S NTS, and the chloroplast region, trnL-trnF . We generated a\nphylogenetic hypothesis for 68 Commelinaceae that partially tests\nprevious morphological, taxonomic classifications. We found little\nevidence for conflict between nuclear and chloroplast regions for\nTradescantia , Murdannia , and Callisia , and some evidence for conflict\nbetween the two regions for Commelina , though conflicting regions of\nthe phylogeny were only weakly supported by bootstrap analyses. We found\nsubtribe Tradescantieae to be paraphyletic, consistent with an rbcL\nstudy, though with a different topology than that produced by rbcL . In\naddition, subtribe Commelineae was monophyletic with strong support. We\nfound Callisia to be polyphyletic, consistent with some previous\nmolecular phylogenetic studies, and we found Tradescantia , Gibasis ,\nCyanotis , Commelina , and Murdannia , to be monophyletic. The molecular\nphylogenies presented here generally supported previous taxonomic\nclassifications.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7939","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7939.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7928","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7928.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7929","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7929.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7932","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7932.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7930","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7930.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7931","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7931.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Callisia Gibasis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7925.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7941.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7933","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7933.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7934","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7934.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Murdannia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7940.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelinaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7943.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7937","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7937.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7938","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7938.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelinoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelinoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7927.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2F","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7935.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7936","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7936.phy"}]}
