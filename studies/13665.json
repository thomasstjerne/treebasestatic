Sequence data,\ngametophyte characteristics and sporophyte morphology support merging a\ntotal of 16 taxa into four different species. (1) D. herbacea,\ncontaining broad-bladed and richly branched forms, has dioecious\ngametophytes. The three other species have monoecious gametophytes: (2)\nD. ligulata which is profusely branched and, except for one sub-species,\nnarrow-bladed, (3) Japanese ligulate Desmarestia, here described as D.\njaponica sp. nov., which is morphologically similar to D. ligulata but\ngenetically distant from all other ligulate taxa. This entity may have\nconserved the morphology of early ligulate Desmarestia. (4) D.\ndudresnayi, including unbranched or little branched broad-bladed taxa. A\nfigure of the holotype of D. dudresnayi, the track of which was lost for\ndecades, was relocated. Taxonomy is complemented by a comparison of ITS\nand cox1 as potential barcode loci, with cox1 offering good resolution\nreflecting the species delimitations within the genus Desmarestia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Desmarestia 5c52d","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63464.phy"}]}
