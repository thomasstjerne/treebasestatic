On the basis of\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic evidence of Inferred from\nphylogenies based on DNA sequences of multiple loci including the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, the large subunit nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene\n(nSSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene sequences (mtSSU), the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-Î± gene (tef1) and the second subunit of\nRNA polymerase II (rpb2), six new genera, 19 lineages (including six new\ngenera) of the sampled 59 species in the antrodia clade are recognized,\nnamely Amyloporia, Antrodia, Antrodia serialis group, Buglossoporus,\nDaedalea, Fibroporia, Fomitopsis sensu stricto (including the type\nspecies, F. pinicola), Fragifomes gen. nov., Laetiporus, Laricifomes,\nNeolentiporus, Niveoporofomes gen. nov., Phaeolus, Piptoporellus gen.\nnov., Postia, Rhodofomes, Rhodofomitopsis gen. nov., Rubellofomes gen.\nnov. and Ungulifomes Ungulidaedalea gen. nov. are established.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90989","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90989.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90979","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90979.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90978","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90978.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90990","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90990.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90988","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90988.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90987","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90987.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90986","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90986.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90985","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90985.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90984","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90984.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90983","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90983.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90982","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90982.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90981","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90981.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90980","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90980.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90977","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90977.phy"}]}
