No\nisolates of Histoplasma capsulatum from Indonesia have been studied. In\nthis study, we reported histoplasmosis cases collected from certain\ndatabases, personal communication with doctors and medical records from\nthe Department of Parasitology, Universitas Indonesia. Demographic data,\nrisk factor, source of infection, clinical presentation, laboratory\ndata, the clinical outcome were discussed. In addition, molecular\nidentification and phylogenetic study were conducted to available\nisolates in the Department of Parasitology, Universitas Indonesia. We\nfound 65 clinical cases reported from Indonesia, 64 disseminated and one\nacute pulmonary histoplasmosis. Exposure to birds and/or bats was a\ncommon risk factor. Most cases were immunocompromised (some with AIDS)\nbut others were apparently immunocompetent. Of the 13 isolates studied\nphylogenetically, 12 were clustered separately from all other previously\ndescribed clades, both by ITS and 4 other protein-coding genes: Arf,\nOle, H-anti, and aTub. These data are indicative of Indonesia probably\nbeing endemic of H. capsulatum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122542","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122542.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122541","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122541.phy"}]}
