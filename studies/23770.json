Around one\nthousand Marasmius species are distributed worldwide, but only 34 have\nbeen recorded in Europe. Although this group of fungi was investigated\nin Europe from the first half of the nineteen century, infrageneric\nclassification is still not clear. In order to achieve more reliable\ninfrageneric classification of European Marasmius species we used\nmolecular data obtained from species representing all sections present\nin Europe, and performed two phylogenetic analyses using ITS/LSU and\nITS/LSU/tefa datasets. Phylogenetic reconstructions obtained in this\nwork support morphology based grouping of species into sections, but in\nthe lower infrageneric ranks (subsections and series), phylogeny is not\ncompletely in compliance with morphology. Marasmius graminum and\nMarasmius curreyi are placed within clade representing section\nGlobulares, while Marasmius hudsonii (section Hygrometrici) appears to\nbe closely related to species of section Epiphylli. Also, results\npresented in this study supports previous assumptions that section\nEpiphylli is better suited as part of the family Physalacriaceae.\nHowever, additional analysis including more taxa from Physalacriaceae\nand related families is needed to support this claim.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115367","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115367.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115364","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115364.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115366","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115366.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115365","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115365.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115368","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115368.phy"}]}
