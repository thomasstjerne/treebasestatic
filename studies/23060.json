The following study thus aimed to\ncharacterize species of Fusarium and related genera associated with smut\nfungi and mushrooms in Iran by applying a polyphasic approach involving\nculture characteristics, morphology, and multigene phylogenetic\nanalyses. Twenty-four fungicolous isolates were recovered from different\nhost species spanning four host families in the Eastern Azerbaijan\nprovinces of north and northwest Iran. Isolates belonged to four\nFusarium species complexes (SC) in, i.e., F. fujikuroi SC, F. oxysporum\nSC, F. incarnatum-equiseti SC, and F. tricinctum SC. One other\nfungicolous taxon was identified as Neocosmospora metavorans. Two new\nlineages belonging to the F. tricinctum SC are here described as F.\ngamsii and F. iranicum, both species occurring on Agaricus bisporus.\nFusarium gamsii is phylogenetically related to F. torulosum, and F.\niranicum to F. flocciferum. Morphological characters support their\ndistinction from their closest phylogenetic sister species.\nAdditionally, A. bisporus and Boletus sp. are here listed as new host\nrecords for members of the F. tricinctum SC in Iran.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112909.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112913.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112911.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112910.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112912.phy"}]}
