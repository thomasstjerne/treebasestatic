Normania encompasses\ntwo species endemic to Macaronesia; Triguera is monotypic and found in\nSpain and northwestern Africa. Both have slightly zygomorphic flowers\nand horned anthers that dehisce by both apical pores and longitudinal\nslits. Micromorphological similarities include trichotomously colporate\npollen grains and seed surface cells with radially thickened extensions.\nMolecular data from the chloroplast ndhF gene and the nuclear ITS region\nestablish that Normania and Triguera are nested within the large genus\nSolanum, where together they form a well supported clade. However, the\nrelationship of this clade to other Solanum subgroups is not resolved.\nTransfer of the Normania and Triguera epithets to Solanum is made,\nnecessitating one new name. The molecular data confirm that the species\nof Solanum endemic to Macaronesia belong to two distinct clades, each\nshowing an independent evolution of heteromorphic anthers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, combined one most pars.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, ITS strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, combined strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3917.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, ndhF strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3913.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, ndhF one most pars. tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Normania and Triguera, ITS one most pars. tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3916.phy"}]}
