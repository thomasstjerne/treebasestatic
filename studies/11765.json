Garrya is taxonomically divided\ninto two sections, Garrya and Fadyenia, which differ in morphology,\nsecondary chemistry, and geographic distribution. The present work uses\nnuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) sequence data from 11 Garrya species to\nelucidate phylogenetic relationships within the genus and test the\nmonophyly of the sections. Results indicate that Garrya contains one\nvery strongly supported clade, corresponding to section Fadyenia;\nsection Garrya is not strongly supported as monophyletic. In addition,\nITS data do not provide evidence for genetic admixture between the two\nsections of Garrya in spite of broad geographic overlap.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CON 50 MAJ RULE","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Garrya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47709.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML GARLI BEST","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Garrya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47710.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP STRICT CON","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Garrya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47711.phy"}]}
