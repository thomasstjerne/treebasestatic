At the family-level, the supertree is fully resolved. For\nexample, the relationships among the Ruminantia appear as (((Cervidae,\nMoschidae) Bovidae) (Giraffidae, Antilocapridae) Tragulidae). However,\ndue to either lack of phylogenetic study or contradictory information,\npolytomies occur within the clades Sus, Muntiacus, Cervus, Delphinidae,\nZiphiidae and Bovidae. Complete species-level phylogenies are necessary\nfor both illustrating and analysing biological, geographical and\necological patterns in an evolutionary framework. The present\nspecies-level tree of the Cetartiodactyla provides the first opportunity\nto examine comparative hypotheses across entirely aquatic and\nterrestrial species within a single mammalian order.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs 1 to 4","ntax":"290","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetartiodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_232.phy"}]}
