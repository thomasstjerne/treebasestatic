Roth.. Stromata on the\ngrass 47.5¨C186 mm long, occurred frequently, but neither perithecium\nnor mature ascus was observed. Morphology of fungal isolates obtained\nfrom symptomatic and asymptomatic tillers were identical to each other,\nand similar to those of epichloë endophytes. In phylogenetic analysis,\nall selected 5 fungal isolates clustered into a significantly distinct\nclade based on sequences of \u001aÂ-tubulin gene (tubB) introns and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-\u001aÁ gene (tefA) introns with bootstrap\nvalues of 99 %, supporting erect of a new species. Concerning about the\nproduction of extremely long stromata on the host plants and absence of\nsexual spores, we propose ¡°Neotyphodium stromatolongus Y. Ji, L. Zhan\net Z. Wang, sp. nov.¡± for this new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium, tefA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5876.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium, tubB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5877.phy"}]}
