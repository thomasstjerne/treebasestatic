(Geraniaceae) displays remarkable morphological diversity, several\nbasic chromosome numbers as well as high levels of organelle genomic\nrearrangements, and represents the 7th largest Cape Floristic Region\nclade. In this study, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree based on 74\nplastome exons and nuclear rDNA ITS regions for 120 species, which\nrepresents 43 % taxon coverage for Pelargonium. We also performed a\ndating analysis to examine the timing of the major radiations in the\ngenus. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide, amino acid, and ITS\nalignments confirmed the previously-documented subgeneric split into\nfive main clades ((C1,C2),(B(A1,A2))) although clade only A1 received\nlow bootstrap support. Using calibration evidence from a range of\nsources the Pelargonium crown age was estimated to be 9.8 My old, much\nyounger than previous estimates for the genus but similar to recent\nstudies of other Cape Floristic lineages that are part of both Fynbos\nand Succulent Karoo biomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pelargonium Plastome","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115861.phy"}]}
