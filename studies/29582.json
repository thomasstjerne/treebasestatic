During a study on wood-decaying fungi,\ntwo new species of the genus are found based on the samples col-lected\nfrom China and Europe, and they are described as Anomoloma denticulatum\nand A. eurasiati-cum. Phylogenetic analyses are carried out based on\nsequences from the internal transcribed spac-er regions (ITS) and the\nlarge subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU). The result\ndemon-strates that Anomoloma denticulatum and A. eurasiaticum are\nclearly distinct species within Ano-moloma. Both new species share the\nprincipal characteristics of the genus, but Anomoloma denticu-latum is\ncharacterized by extensive white rhizomorphs spread under the whole\nfruiting body, an-gular pores measuring 12 per mm, distinctly lacerate\nto dentate dissepiments and ellipsoid basid-iospores measuring 3.54.3 ×\n22.5 μm. Anomoloma eurasiaticum is characterized by bearing plenty of\nlarge crystals on mycelia and growth on Picea in high altitude areas. A\nkey to accepted species of Anomoloma worldwide is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136151.phy"}]}
