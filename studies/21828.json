Based on\nmorphological characters and phylogeny of DNA sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region and part of the translation elongation\nfactor (TEF) 1-α gene, a new species, namely D. juglandis is described\nfrom Juglandis regia in China. In addition, about D. juglandis, we found\nthe sexual ascospore on the host. Besides, Dothiorella sp，as a unknown\nspecies in China, we also described in this
