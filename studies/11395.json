ECM fungi\ninclude, though are not limited to, about 5000 described species of\nAgaricales from numerous, independently evolved lineages. Two central\nhypotheses suggest different explanations for the origin of ECM fungal\ndiversity: (i) dual origins, initially with the Pinaceae in the Jurassic\nand later with angiosperms during the Late Cretaceous, and (ii) a\nsimultaneous and convergent radiation of ECM lineages in response to\ncooling climate during the Palaeogene and advancing temperate ECM plant\ncommunities. Neither of these hypotheses is supported here. While we\ndemonstrate support for asynchronous origins of ECM Agaricales, the\ntiming of such events appears to have occurred more recently than\nsuggested by the first hypothesis, first during the Cretaceous and later\nduring the Palaeogene. We are also unable to reject models of rate\nconstancy, which suggests that the diversity of ECM Agaricales is not a\nconsequence of convergent rapid radiations following evolutionary\ntransitions from saprotrophic to ECM habits. ECM lineages of Agaricales\ndiffer not only in age, but also in rates of diversification and rate of\nsubstitution at nuclear ribosomal RNA loci. These results question the\nbiological uniformity of the ECM guild.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebelomateae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53770.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amantia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53771.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"797","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53772.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnangiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53776.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Descolea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53769.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Catathelasma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53773.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"491","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53777.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeocollybia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53774.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53775.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hygrophorus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53778.phy"}]}
