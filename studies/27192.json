This is the second species after A. bilocularis\ndescribed with bilocular anthers. Illustrations of plant morphology are\nprovided by means of SEM images and habitat photographs are included.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of the new species were investigated\nusing five plastid DNA markers (matK, ndhF, rbcL, rpoB, and rpoC1), with\npublished sequences augmented by several new sequences resulting in\ncoverage of all described species in the genus. Althenia tzvelevii forms\na clade with A. patentifolia and A. bilocularis and other relationships\nwithin the genus are clarified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepilaena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126982.phy"}]}
