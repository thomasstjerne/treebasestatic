A new species, Cladosporium hebeiense\nwas isolated belonging to the Cladosporium herbarum complex from leaf\nspots of Vitis vinifera in China. Morphologically distinct C. hebeiense\nconsists of erect, flexuous, distinctly geniculate, subcylindrical\nconidiophores; pale green-brown, smooth, thick-walled conidia with\nprotuberant and darkened conidial hila; and aseptate, obovoidal to short\nellipsoidal, small terminal conidia. A multigene phylogenetic analysis\nbased on the internal transcribed spacer region, partial translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha gene and the actin gene showed C. hebeiense as\na new species, different from C. ramotenellum. This study provides\nmorphological and molecular biological studies of the new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium hebeiense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111674.phy"}]}
