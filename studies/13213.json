One of the most complete\ndinosaur fossil ever found, it shows for the first time the entire\nmorphology of a hadrosauroid phylogenetically close to, but outside the\nNorth American and Asiatic hadrosaurids. It lived on an island developed\non a carbonate platform in the Tethys Ocean and the small size of the\nspecimens suggests that it may be an insular dwarf. The skeleton has\nmany peculiarities including cursorial adaptations, and a mix of derived\nand primitive features. European hadrosauroids probably did not evolve\nby vicariance nor did they colonize the European Archipelago from North\nAmerica, but rather came from Asia by island hopping.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55916.phy"}]}
