The aim of the present study was to resolve the\nstatus of new Calonectria collections obtained on Ilex leaves from\nFrance. Based on DNA sequence data of their β-tubulin and histone gene\nregions, as well as morphology, the new collections matched the ex-type\nstrain of Cylindrocladium ilicicola. On the host and in culture, yellow\nto brownish-yellow perithecia were observed that did not strain red in 3\n% KOH. Based on these results, C. ilicicola and its purported\nteleomorph, Ca. pyrochroa, were shown to represent two distinct species,\nas the latter has bright red perithecia that strain purple in KOH. A new\ncombination, Ca. lauri, based on Tetracytum lauri, is subsequently\nproposed for C. ilicicola. Calonectria lauri is distinct from Ca.\nilicicola, a pathogen commonly associated with Cylindrocladium black rot\nof peanut. Finally, Ca. canadiana is proposed as new name for Cy.\ncanadiense, which is a nursery pathogen involved with root rot of\nseveral tree genera in Quebec, Canada.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25358.phy"}]}
