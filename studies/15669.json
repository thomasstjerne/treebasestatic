It can function as an electron carrier or cofactor in redox\nbiochemistry and energetics, and serves as substrate to generate the\nsecondary messengers cADPR and NAADP. While de novo NAD+ biosynthesis is\nessential, different metabolic pathways exist in different eukaryotic\nclades. The kynurenine pathway starting with tryptophan, was most likely\npresent in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes, and is active in\nfungi and animals. The aspartate pathway, detected in most\nphotosynthetic eukaryotes, was probably acquired from the cyanobacterial\nendosymbiont that gave rise to chloroplasts. An evolutionary analysis of\nenzymes catalyzing de novo NAD+ biosynthesis resulted in evolutionary\ntrees incongruent with established organismal phylogeny, indicating\nnumerous gene transfers. Endosymbiotic gene transfers introduced the\naspartate pathway into eukaryotes and distributed it among different\nphotosynthetic clades. In addition, several horizontal gene transfers\nsubstituted eukaryotic genes with bacterial orthologs. While horizontal\ngene transfer is accepted as a key mechanism in prokaryotic evolution,\nit supposed to be rare in eukaryotic evolution. The essential metabolic\npathway of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis in eukaryotes was shaped by\nnumerous gene transfers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74353.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74354","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74354.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74402.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74397.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74400.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74401.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74385.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74387.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74388","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74389.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74393.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74394.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74392.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74398.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74395.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74399.phy"}]}
