In this study, the fungus was\nidentified and its pathogenicity to R. melanophloeos was tested.\nMultigene phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences of the partial\nLSU gene region, ITS nuclear ribosomal DNA gene region, and two regions\nof the Î²-tubulin (BT) gene, showed that the fungus represents a formerly\nundescribed genus and species in the Cryphonectriaceae. The fungus was\nalso morphologically distinct from other genera in this family.\nInoculation trials showed that the fungus described here as\nImmersiporthe knoxdaviesiana gen. et sp. nov. is an aggressive pathogen\nof R. melanophloeos trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Immersiporthe Rapanea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52111.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Immersiporthe Rapanea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52110.phy"}]}
