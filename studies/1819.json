The final data matrix consisted of 4 loci (nuc SSU\nrDNA, nuc LSU rDNA, tef1, RPB2) for 96 taxa, representing 5 of the 7\norders in the current classification of Dothideomycetes and several\noutgroup taxa representative of the major clades in the Pezizomycotina.\nThe resulting phylogeny differentiated two main dothideomycete lineages\ncomprising the pseudoparaphysate Pleosporales and aparaphysate\nDothideales. We propose the subclasses Pleosporomycetidae (order\nPleosporales) and Dothideomycetidae (orders Dothideales, Capnodiales and\nMyriangiales). Furthermore, we provide strong molecular support for the\nplacement of Mycosphaerellaceae and Piedraiaceae within the Capnodiales,\nand introduce Davidiellaceae as a new family to accommodate species of\nDavidiella with Cladosporium anamorphs. Some taxa could not be placed\nwith certainty (e.g., Hysteriales), but there was strong support for new\ngroupings. The clade containing members of the genera Botryosphaeria and\nGuignardia resolved well but without support for any relationship to any\nother described orders and we hereby propose the new order\nBotryosphaeriales. These data are also consistent with the removal of\nChaetothyriales and Coryneliales from the Dothideomycetes and strongly\nsupport their placement in the Eurotiomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2802.phy"}]}
