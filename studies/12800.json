The intermixing of\nthese chemotypes at the local scale and lack of genetic variation\nbetween them is puzzling given the apparent absence of sexual\nreproduction. Conidiomata were originally reported for Thamnolia in 1874\nbut dismissed as of foreign origin. This study presents conclusive\nmicroscopic evidence for the existence of pycnidial conidiomata\ncontaining conidia on thalli of Thamnolia vermicularis from\ngeographically widespread locations. Sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA from excised pycnidial\nconidiomata matched that of thallus tips from individual Thamnolia\nthalli. Production of conidia would be a means by which rare instances\nof a mutation affecting thallus chemistry could appear in a population\nand could explain why both chemotypes are found worldwide but donÂ’t form\ntwo monophyletic groups. Our discovery of thalli with branches of\nalternative chemotypes supports this proposed mechanism to account for\nthe intermixing of T. vermicularis chemotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53210","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53210.phy"}]}
