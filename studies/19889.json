DIR domain-containing or DIR-like\nproteins are, thus, termed for not having a clear characterization. A\ntranscriptome- and genome-wide survey of DIR domain-containing proteins\nin sugarcane was carried out, in addition to phylogenetic,\nphysicochemical and transcriptional analyses. A total of 120\nnon-redundant sequences containing the DIR domain were identified and\nclassified into 64 groups according to phylogenetic and sequence\nalignment analyses. In silico analysis of transcript abundance showed\nthat these sequences are expressed at low levels in leaves and genes in\nthe same phylogenetic clade have similar expression patterns. Expression\nanalysis of ShDIR1-like transcripts in the culm internodes of sugarcane\ndemonstrates their abundance in mature internodes, their induction by\nnitrogen fertilization and their predominant expression in cells that\nhave a lignified secondary cell wall, such as vascular bundles of young\ninternodes and parenchymal cells of the pith of mature internodes. Due\nto the lack of information about the functional role of DIR in plants, a\npossible relationship is discussed between the ShDIR1-like\ntranscriptional profile and cell wall development in parenchyma cells of\nsugarcane culm, which typically accumulates large amounts of sucrose.\nThe number of genes encoding the DIR domain-containing proteins in\nsugarcane is intriguing and is an indication per se that these proteins\nmay have an important metabolic role and thus deserve to be better\nstudied.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S11","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dirigent Figure S11 Dir-c","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100543.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S10","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dirigent Figure S10 Dir-b/d","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100542.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dirigent-Full","ntax":"335","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dirigent Angiosperms Domain SACC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100541.phy"}]}
