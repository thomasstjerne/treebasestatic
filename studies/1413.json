Topological\ncongruence in relation to an extensive mitochondrial DNA multigene\nphylogeny (derived from 2423 b.p. of 12S, 16S, ND4 and CYTB genes) of\nthe Asian pitviper Trimeresurus radiation was used to compare\ncombinations of „by eye‰ and ClustalX 1.8 assisted alignments of two\nnuclear introns. Indels were treated as missing data, fifth character\nstates and assigned simple and multistate codes. Upon recovery of the\noptimal alignment and indel treatment strategy, a total evidence\napproach was used to investigate the phylogenetic utility of the indels\nand test new generic arrangements within Trimeresurus. Approximately one\nthird of the intron data partitions exhibited LVHs suggesting that they\nare common in introns. Furthermore, a simple concatenation approach can\nfacilitate the incorporation of LVHs into phylogenetic analyses to make\nuse of all available data and investigate mechanisms of molecular\nevolution. Analyses of ClustalX 1.8 assisted alignments were generally\nmore congruent than the „by eye‰ alignment and the analysis of a simple\ncoded, ClustalX 1.8 (gap opening cost 5, gap extension cost 1) alignment\nrevealed the most congruent tree. The total evidence approach supported\nthe new arrangements within Trimeresurus suggesting that the phylogeny\nshould be considered as a working benchmark in Asian pitviper\nsystematics. Finally, a critical appraisal of the diverse array of\nindels (56–57 per intron, ranging from 1–151 b.p. in length) suggested\nthat they are a combination of homologous and homoplasious events\nunrelated to indel size or location within the intron.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2245.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2246.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2247.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2248.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2249.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2250.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2251.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2252.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2253.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2254.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2255.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2256.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2257.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trimeresurus Radiation of Asian Pitvipers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2258.phy"}]}
