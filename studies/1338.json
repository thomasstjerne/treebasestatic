This study was therefore undertaken to re-evaluate\nthe genera of the Lulworthiales based on the SSU and LSU rDNA genes.\nTaxonomic revisions are proposed here for Lulworthia crassa, L.\nlignoarenaria, L. uniseptata and Lindra marinera: Lulworthia crassa is\ntransferred into the genus Kohlmeyeriella; the new genus Lulwoidea is\nestablished for L. lignoarenaria; the new genus Lulwoana is established\nfor L. uniseptata; Lindra marinera is reduced to synonymy with L.\nthalassiae. Taxonomic descriptions are emended for the genus Lulworthia\nsensu stricto, and for L. grandispora and Lindra thalassiae. A neotype\nis designated for Lulworthia grandispora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2119.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2120.phy"}]}
