Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are\nrevolutionizing many fields of biology, and have an enormous potential\nto boost the acquisition of insect mitogenomes. In this study, twenty\nfull or partial mitogenomes were sequenced from pooled genomic DNA\nsamples by NGS for leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae). Combined with published\nmitogenome sequences, a higher level phylogeny of Chrysomelidae was\nreconstructed under maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference with\ndifferent models and various data treatments. The results revealed\nsupport for a basal position of Bruchinae within Chrysomelidae. In\naddition, two major groupings of subfamily were recovered in most\nanalyses: one including Spilopyrinae, (Donaciinae + Criocerinae),\n(((Cryptocephalinae + Chlamisinae) + Cassidinae) + Eumolpinae), another\ncontaining a non-monophyletic Chrysomelinae and a monophyletic\nGalerucinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PCGRNA iqtre","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106110.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCGRNA pb","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106111","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106111.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG iqtre","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106112","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106112.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG pb","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106113","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106113.phy"},{"tree_label":"Alicut PCG","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106114","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106114.phy"},{"tree_label":"ALICUT PCG pb","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106115","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106115.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG AA iqtre","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106116.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG AA pb","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106117.phy"}]}
