Transfers of Ch. inflatus to Dictyosporium and of\nCheiromoniliophora elegans to Pseudodictyosporium are proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50090.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50095.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50093","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50093.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50087.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50086.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50085.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50084.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50083","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50083.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50082.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50079.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50077.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50076.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50073","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50073.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50070.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50094","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50094.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50092.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50091.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50089.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50088.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50081.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50080.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50075.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50074","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50074.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50072","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50072.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50071.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50069.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50068.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 36","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50097.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50096.phy"}]}
