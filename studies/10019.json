Within\nthe past three years, a great diversity within Albugo causing white\nblister disease to Brassicaceae has been observed, leading to the\ndescription of two new, specialized species within the parasites of\nBrassicaceae and the confirmation that Albugo lepidii is distinct from\nAlbugo candida. In addition, it has been realized that Albugo candida\nhas a broad host spectrum within the Brassicaceae, extending to the\nclosely related Cleomaceae. Through molecular phylogenetic analysis of\ncox2 sequences and morphological comparison, it is demonstrated that the\nhost range of this species in fact reaches to Capparaceae. These\nfindings are both relevant for practical plant pathology and raise\nquestions regarding the mechanisms involved in the exceptional broad\nhost range in Albugo candida, compared to the other species so far\ninvestigated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albuginaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6414.phy"}]}
