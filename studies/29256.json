Fragilipedes\nwhich can highly enhance the germination efficiency of Gastrodia elata\nseeds, was discovered in subtropical areas of China. Morphological\ncharacters compared with related Mycena species and phylogenetic\nanalyses conducted based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and\nthe large subunit (LSU) regions of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene sequences\nwith Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Analysis (BA) tree show that\nthe new taxon can be distinguished from phenotypically similar and\nphylogenetically related species. Optimal cultural conditions on\nbasidiomata formation of this new taxon and comparison germination rates\nwith M. citrinomarginata are also presented in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con tree","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycena 2214","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135094.phy"}]}
