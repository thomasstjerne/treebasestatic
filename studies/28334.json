Lyomyces ochraceoalbus is\ncharacterised by resupinate basidiomata with tuberculate, cracking\nhymenial surface, clavate basidia with a median constriction,gathering\nnumerous irregular crystals and thin-walled basidiospores with one or\ntwo globules. Lyomyces niveus is characterised by resupinate\nbasidiomata, smooth to grandinioid hymenial surface, presence of three\nkings of cystidia, and broadly ellipsoid basidiospores. Sequences of ITS\nand nLSU gene regions were generated, and phylogenetic analyses were\nperformed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference methods. The phylogenetic reconstruction of Schizoporaceae\nbased on a concatenated ITS+nLSU dataset showed that two new species\nnested in Lyomyces. A second phylogenetic analysis, of the genus\nLyomyces, demonstrated that multiple isolates of L. niveus forms a\nmonophyletic lineage and is sister to a clade comprising of L. juniperi,\nL. vietnamensis, L. crustosus and L. ochraceoalbus. And L. ochraceoalbus\nis closely related to L. crustosus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetales ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134600.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyomyces ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134591.phy"}]}
