A new species,\nColletotrichum echinochloae, is then proposed based on the\nmorphological, pathological, and molecular characteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum echinochloae, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum echinochloae, HMG","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6464.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum echinochloae, SOD2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6422.phy"}]}
