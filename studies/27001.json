Phylogenetic analyses revealed that sequences\nretrieved from Erysiphe lonicerae, a widespread powdery mildew species\ndistributed in the northern hemisphere on a wide range of Lonicera spp.,\nconstitutes a complex of two separate species, viz., E. lonicerae (s.\nstr.) and Erysiphe ehrenbergii comb. nov. Erysiphe lonicerae occurs on\nLonicera spp. belonging to Lonicera subgen. Lonicera (= subgen.\nCaprifolium and subgen. Periclymenum), as well as L. japonica. Erysiphe\nehrenbergii comb. nov. occurs on Lonicera spp. of Lonicera subgen.\nChamaecerasus. Phylogenetic and morphological analyses have also\nrevealed that Microsphaera caprifoliacearum ( Erysiphe caprifoliacearum)\nshould be reduced to synonymy with E. lonicerae (s. str.). Additionally,\nErysiphe lonicerae-japonicae sp. nov. on Lonicera japonica in Japan is\ndescribed and the new name Erysiphe flexibilis, based on Microsphaera\nlonicerae var. flexuosa, is introduced. The phylogeny of Erysiphe\nehrenbergii and E. lonicerae as well as other Erysiphe species on\nhoneysuckle is discussed, and a survey of all species, including a key\nto the species concerned, is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe lonicerae complex ITS 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131023.phy"}]}
