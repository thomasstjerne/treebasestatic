Macaronesian Lotus, which are typically classified within one\nof two subgenera, Lotus subgenus Pedrosia or L. subg. Rhyncholotus, are\ndiagnosed by the presence of a forked or toothed style and slight\ndifferences in corolla morphology. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian\nanalyses of internal transcribed spacer sequences identify a\nwell-supported northwest African-Cape Verde Island clade that includes\nall members of Lotus subgenus Pedrosia + L. subg. Rhyncholotus. There is\nmodest support for two independently nested clades containing the Canary\nIsland species and two non-Canarian species, L. assakensis from Africa\nand L. azoricus endemic to the Azores. Biogeographic reconstruction\nbased on a parsimony topology unequivocally identifies an African origin\nfor the Canary Island group with subsequent back dispersal to the\nAfrican continent and a single dispersal event to the Azores. A\nphylogeographic assessment of colonization and diversification patterns\nsuggests that geographic isolation via interisland colonization of\necologically similar habitats is the primary mode of species\ndiversification in Canary Island Lotus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Canary Island Lotus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4700.phy"}]}
