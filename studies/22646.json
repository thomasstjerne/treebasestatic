Morphologically the species\nproduces abundant solitary chlamydospores with radiating hyphae, being\ndistinguished from Mortierella calciphila due to the absence of\nsporangiophores and gemmae clusters. Physiologically, the species is\nconsidered facultative alkaliphile able to endure pHs levels up to\n11.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU Tree","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU Tree.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111576.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114143.phy"}]}
