Phylogenetic relationships\nwithin the order were previously not fully resolved. Fifteen plastid\ngenomes representing 14 species, ten genera and seven families of\nCornales were newly sequenced for comparative analyses of genome\nfeatures, evolution, and phylogenomics based on different partitioning\nschemes and filtering strategies. Results: All plastomes of the 14\nCornales species had the typical quadripartite structure with a genome\nsize ranging from 156,567 bp to 158,715 bp, which included two inverted\nrepeats (25,859-26,451 bp) separated by a large single-copy region\n(86,089-87,835 bp) and a small single-copy region (18,250-18,856bp)\nregion. These plastomes encoded the same set of 114 unique genes\nincluding 31 transfer RNA, 4 ribosomal RNA and 79 coding genes, with an\nidentical gene order across all examined Cornales species. Two genes\n(rpl22 and ycf15) contained premature stop codons in seven and five\nspecies respectively. The phylogenetic relationships among all sampled\nspecies were fully resolved with maximum support. Different filtering\nstrategies (none, light and strict) of sequence alignment did not have\nan effect on these relationships. The topology recovered from coding and\nnoncoding data sets was the same as for the whole plastome, regardless\nof filtering strategy. Moreover, mutational hotspots and highly\ninformative regions were identified. Conclusions: Phylogenetic\nrelationships among families and intergeneric relationships within\nfamily of Cornales were well resolved. Different filtering strategies\nand partitioning schemes do not influence the relationships. Plastid\ngenomes have great potential to resolve deep phylogenetic relationships\nof plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Coding-ML","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S2A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108179.phy"},{"tree_label":"Coding-BI","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S2A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108178.phy"},{"tree_label":"coding-halfgap-BI","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S3B","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108180.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108208","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108208.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108209","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108209.phy"},{"tree_label":"coding-nongap-BI","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S4A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108182.phy"},{"tree_label":"coding-nongap-ML","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S4A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108183.phy"},{"tree_label":"coding-halfgap-ML","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.S3A","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108181.phy"}]}
