The morphological characteristics of the\nspecies have been insufficiently known since its first description in\n1951. Fresh samples of this species were collected on M. obovata for the\nfirst time in Korea. Based on the Korean samples, both anamorph and\nteleomorph of this species were described and illustrated in detail. The\ninflated base of foot-cells in conidiophores is a unique character not\nfound in the two related species, E. magnifica and E. bulbosa, known on\nMagnolia spp. The sequence of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S\nof ribosomal DNA obtained from Korean and Japanese samples confirmed its\nplacement in the section Microsphaera of the genus Erysiphe in\nphylogenetic position. Comparison and synoptic key of the three species\nof Erysiphe known on Magnolia spp. were provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe magnoliae ITS ML Analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58305.phy"}]}
