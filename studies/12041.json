{"Authors":" Nikki Charlton, Kelly D Craven, Shipra Mittal, Andrew\nHopkins, Carolyn Young","Year":" 2012","Title":" Epichloë canadensis, a new interspecific epichloid hybrid\nsymbiotic with Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis)","Journal":" Mycologia","Volume":" 104","Issue":" 2","Pages":" 1187-1199","Keywords":" alkaloid diversity, endophyte, Epichloë amarillans, E.\nelymi, lolines, Neotyphodium","DOI":" 10.3852/11-403","Abstract":" Many Epichloë endophytes found in cool-season grasses are\ninterspecific hybrids possessing much or all of the genomes of two or\nthree progenitors. Here we characterize Epichloë canadensis sp. nov., a\nhybrid species inhabiting the grass species Elymus canadensis native to\nNorth America. Three distinct morphotypes were identified that were\nseparated into two groups by molecular phylogenetic analysis. Sequence\nanalysis of the translation elongation factor 1-a (tefA) and b-tubulin\n(tubB) genes revealed two copies in all isolates examined. Phylogenetic\nanalyses indicated that allele 1 of each gene was derived from Epichloë\namarillans and allele 2 from Epichloë elymi. This is the first\ndocumentation of an interspecific hybrid endophyte derived from parents\nof strictly North American origins. Alkaloid gene profiling using\nprimers specific to genes in the peramine, loline, indole-diterpene and\nergot alkaloid pathways may indicate chemotypic variation in the ergot\nalkaloid and loline pathways between the assigned morphotypes. All\nisolates have the gene enabling the production of peramine but lack\ngenes in the indole-diterpene biosynthesis pathway. Morphology and\nphylogenetic evidence support the designation of isolates from El.\ncanadensis as a new interspecific hybrid species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
