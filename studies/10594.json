It was originally\nsegregated from S. cespitans based on two quantitative characters,\nmedian lamina cell width and relative costa length. Molecular data\npresented here (ITS, rps4, trnG, psbA2) indicates that S. australe is\nnested within a well supported clade of S. touretii. Morphologcial\nmeasurements also fail to demonstrate any differences between S.\naustrale and S. touretii. Based on the lack of any molecular or\nmorphological differences between S. touretii and S. australe, and\nconsidering the ruderal habitat of the latter, S. australe is reduced to\nsynonomy with S. touretii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9538.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9539","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9539.phy"}]}
