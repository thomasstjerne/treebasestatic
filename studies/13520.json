Recent studies\nsupport multiple species within P. quercina based on material from\nEurope, North America and western Asia. The identity of Parmelina\nquercina s.lat. reported from eastern Asia and Alaska remains unknown.\nWe compared DNA sequences, secondary chemistry and morphological traits\nof Parmelina from Alaska, Russia and China. These data support the\nresurrection of Parmelina yalungana to accommodate eastern Asian and\nAlaskan material. Parmelina yalungana differs from congeners in\nascospore dimensions, geographic range and molecular data from three\ngene loci. We place P. yalungana in the phylogenetic context of P.\nquercina group using DNA from Alaska and Russian material.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parmelina yalungana resurrected","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57938.phy"}]}
