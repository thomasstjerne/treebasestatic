Analyses of morphological traits\nand molecular sequence data led to identifications of the causal agents\nof the powdery mildew diseases involved. Fontanesia phillyreoides was\ninfected by Phyllactinia fraxini, and the powdery mildew on Jasminum\nfruticans can be classified as Erysiphe cf.Â aquilegiae. The latter host\nshowed traces of a co-infection with a second powdery mildew (only\nasexual morph) belonging to the genus Phyllactinia (= Ovulariopsis) and\nmorphologically well agreeing with P. fraxini. However, a final\nconfirmation by means of molecular methods failed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery mildew (Ascomycota, Erysiphales) on Fontanesia\nphillyreoides and Jasminum fruticans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96661.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Powdery mildew (Ascomycota, Erysiphales) on Fontanesia\nphillyreoides and Jasminum fruticans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96662.phy"}]}
