However, the 18S rRNA gene tree clearly\nshows that this genus is not a natural taxon, because our own isolates\nand reported strains separately form four well-supported monophyletic\ngroups. These four groups are clearly distinguishable by their profiles\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoid pigments and cell and\ncolony morphology, e.g., persistence of sporangial wall, manner of the\ncell cleavage at the zoospore formation, and development of the\nectoplasmic nets. Therefore, the four groups are assigned to four genera\nincluding three new genera, i.e., Ulkenia sensu stricto, Botryochytrium,\nParietichytrium, and Sicyoidochytrium gen. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Labyrinthulomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_352.phy"}]}
