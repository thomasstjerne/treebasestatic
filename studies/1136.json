Independent analyses of the sequence data were largely\ncongruent and when combined provided stronger support for relationships.\nThe results suggest that Brachyglottis as currently circumscribed is\nparaphyletic. However, a more inclusive monophyletic group was supported\nthat consists of the genera Bedfordia, Brachyglottis, Dolichoglottis,\nHaastia, and Traversia. Short branch lengths suggest there has been a\nspectacular adaptive radiation of the Brachyglottis alliance in recent\ntimes. The species are morphologically diverse and occupy a wide range\nof ecological niches in New Zealand, and yet exhibit very little\nsequence variation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnK/MatK Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4378.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4379.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combine ITS and trnK/MatK Senecioneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4380.phy"}]}
