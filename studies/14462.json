Marasmius and Sicciformes) collected in South Korea.\nThe detailed morphological descriptions with figures for five species\nand a key for the identification are provided. Marasmius wisteriae is\ndescribed as a new species, and M. bulliardii, M. rotalis, M. tubulatus\n(all in the subsect. Marasmius), and M. ruforotula (subsect.\nSicciformes) are newly recorded in Korea. Their taxonomic position was\nconfirmed by the phylogeny based on ITS and LSU rRNA genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64880.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64881.phy"}]}
