Helicoma chiayiense is distinct in\nhaving hyaline conidiophores arising from repent mycelium, producing\nbroad conidia that bear secondary conidia. Helicosporium taiwanense is\ndistinct in having robust poly-denticulate conidiophores producing\nconidia with a wide conidial filament. The phylogenetic relationship of\nthese species were sought among representative taxa of the helicosporous\nhyphomycetes by comparing their ITS of the rDNA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107407","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107407.phy"}]}
