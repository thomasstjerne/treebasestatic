Both newly collected samples and the holotype were\nexamined. Herein we describe for the first time the structure of\ntetrasporangial nemathecia, decussately dividing tetrasporangia and male\ngametophytes. We show that this species has a thin cortex, decussately\ndivided tetrasporangia formed in nemathecia and a tela arachnoidea\n(network of inner pericarp filaments surrounding mature\ncarposporophytes), as in the genus Leptofauchea. LSU rRNA analyses\nresolved G. leptophylla in the Faucheaceae (in which it was robustly\nseparated from Gloiocladia), forming a well-supported clade with five\nother species of Leptofauchea and two species of Webervanbossea. We\ntherefore propose the new combination Leptofauchea leptophylla comb.\nnov. Iridescence in water, a distinct short stipe and a medulla composed\nof three to four cell layers are conspicuous diagnostic characters of L.\nleptophylla within the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptofauchea leptophylla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93603.phy"}]}
