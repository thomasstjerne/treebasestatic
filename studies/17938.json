As a result, the rela- tionships among the taxa\nas well as the evolution of morphological traits have remained elusive\nand the traditional classifications are highly artificial. Using five\nmolecular markers (nuclear ITS, plastid matK plus trnK, ndhF, trnL-trnF,\npsbA-trnH), we arrived at a phylogenetic hypothesis of this group, the\ngenera Alcea, Althaea and Malvalthaea being studied here for the first\ntime with molecular data. Althaea and, in particular, Lavatera and Malva\nare highly polyphyletic as currently circumscribed, because their diag-\nnostic characters, the number and degree of fusion of the epicalyx\nbracts, evolve in a highly homoplasious manner. In contrast, fruit\nmorphology largely agrees with the molecularly delimited groups. Hybrid\nori- gins confirmed for the genus Malvalthaea and for Lavatera\nmauritanica and hybridization in the group of ruderal small-flowered\nmallows underline the importance of reticulate evolution in shaping the\nhistory of this group and complicating the interpretation of\nmorphological evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malva alliance","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89089.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malva alliance","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89088.phy"}]}
