A clade including Acidodontium,\nAnomobryum, Brachymenium acuminatum, Bryum species, Haplodontium,\nMielichhoferia himalayana, and Plagiobryum is robustly supported in all\nanalyses. The sections Brachymenium, Globosa, and Leptostomopsis of\nBrachymenium occur in a basal grade also including Bryum billarderi and\nRhodobryum. The total evidence analysis supports Acidodontium as a\nmonophyletic genus, whereas the maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses\nsuggest a polyphyletic Acidodontium. Features of the reduced peristome\nare homoplastic within the Bryaceae, and it is obvious that\ncircumscriptions of taxa based on sporophytic characters alone may unite\ntaxa that are distantly related. The rosulate growth condition is\nhomoplastic within the family, which suggests that the genus Rosulabryum\nis not monophyletic. Based on present phylogenetic evidence, no\nmorphological synapomorphies can be detected for the Bryaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bryaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4073.phy"}]}
