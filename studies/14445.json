It is only the second known species of Brasiliocroton. Its\nphylogenetic position was inferred based on sequences from the nrITS and\nplastid trnL-F markers, using a sampling of closely related genera in\ntribe Crotoneae. Brasiliocroton muricatus was recovered within tribe\nCrotoneae, forming a clade with B. mamoninha. This clade is in turn\nsister to the large genus Croton, giving additional support to previous\nphylogenetic studies including B. mamoninha. The most obvious\nmorphological characters distinguishing the new species from B.\nmamoninha are the unisexual, axillary inflorescences and the smaller\nfruits with muricate surface and white, stellate trichomes, as opposed\nto bisexual, terminal inflorescences and bigger fruits with smooth\nsurface and ochraceous to brown dendritic trichomes in B. mamoninha.\nBoth species of Brasiliocroton have the filaments of the staminate\nflowers erect in bud, which is the main character state distinguishing\nthem from the closely related Croton and Astraea. Additional\nmorphological features distinguing Brasiliocroton and Croton from the\nrest of tribe Crotoneae are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crotoneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64780.phy"}]}
