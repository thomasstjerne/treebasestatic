Thus, Endogonales is considered a key taxon\nfor elucidating the evolutionary process of EM associations. Recent\nstudies revealed high diversity of EM lineages of Basidiomycota and\nAscomycota, however, EM association of Endogonales and its relatives\nremains largely unknown. In this study, EM root tips having a unique\nfungal sheath, with aseptate and highly branching hyphae of variable\nwidth, were identified in Quercus acutissima and Q. crispula forests in\nthe temperate zone of Japan. The mycobionts were confirmed as Endogone\nsp., which were located in the sister clade of E. pisiformis, based on\nphylogenetic analyses of small and large subunits of the nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene and the elongation factor-1Î± gene. This is the first\nreport of EM of Endogone in natural forests in the Northern Hemisphere,\nand the first finding on Quercus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endogone ectomycorrhizas in natural oak\nnr18S+nr28S+EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97372.phy"}]}
