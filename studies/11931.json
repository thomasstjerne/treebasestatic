A highly resolved molecular phylogeny with\ndivergence dates for all living cat species, derived from autosomal,\nX-linked, Y-linked, and mitochondrial gene segments (22,789 base pairs)\nand 16 fossil calibrations define eight principal lineages produced\nthrough at least 10 intercontinental migrations facilitated by sea-level\nfluctuations. A ghost lineage analysis indicates that available felid\nfossils underestimate (i.e., unrepresented basal branch length) first\noccurrence by an average of 76%, revealing a low representation of felid\nlineages in paleontological remains. The phylogenetic performance of\ndistinct gene classes showed that Y-chromosome segments are appreciably\nmore informative than mitochondrial DNA, X-linked, or autosomal genes in\nresolving the rapid Felidae species radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relations among Felid Species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48693.phy"}]}
