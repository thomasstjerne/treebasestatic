We report on a comprehensive\nmolecular phylogeny for the family. Two nuclear genes (c-myc and RAG1)\ncomprising approximately 4,500 bp of data (most of which reside in\nexons) are applied for the first time to rodent phylogenetics.\nParsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of the separate gene\nregions and combined data reveal the presence of five major lineages and\nreject the conventional elevation of the flying squirrels (Pteromyinae)\nto one of the two subfamilies. Instead, flying squirrels are derived\nfrom one of the tree squirrel lineages. C-myc indels corroborate the\nsequence based topologies. The common ancestor of extant squirrels\nappears to have been arboreal, confirming the fossil evidence. The\nresults also reveal an unexpected clade of mostly terrestrial squirrels\nwith African and Holarctic centers of diversity. Our results demonstrate\nthe phylogenetic utility of relatively slowly evolving nuclear exonic\ndata even for relatively recent clades such as rodent families.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sciuridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1237.phy"}]}
