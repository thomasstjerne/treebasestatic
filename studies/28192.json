Rinodina salicis is distinguishable from\nRinodina excrescens Vain., the most similar species, by blastidiate to\ntiny areolate, olive-gray thallus, contiguous apothecia, non-pruinose\ndiscs, paler disc color, Pachysporaria-type II ascospore, wider\nascospores, and the absence of secondary metabolites. Rinodina zeorina\ndiffers from Rinodina hypobadia Sheard by areolate and brownish thallus\nwithout distinct margin, non-pruinose apothecia, colorless and wider\nparathecium, narrower paraphyses with non-pigmented and unswollen tips,\nlonger and narrower ascospores with angular to globose lumina, lighter\npigmentation in hypothecium, and the absence of pannarin. Molecular\nanalyses employing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences strongly\nsupport the two new species to be unique in the genus Rinodina. An\nupdated key is provided to assist in the identification of all 61 taxa\nin Rinodina of the far east Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for ML","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rinodina ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130924.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rinodina ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130925.phy"}]}
