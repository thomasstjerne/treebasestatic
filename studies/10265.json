By expanding the most comprehensive analysis on\nerigonine phylogeny by Miller and Hormiga (2004, Cladistics, 20,\n385-442) we tested its robustness towards the addition of closely\nrelated taxa and also the monophyly of the Savignia-group defined by\nMillidge (1977, Bull. Br. arachnol. Soc. 4, 1-60). The original\ncharacter matrix was therefore expanded by addition of 18 newly scored\nspecies in 15 genera and also includes all species that were scored by\nother authors. This adds up to 98 species in 91 erigonine genera plus 13\noutgroup taxa. The parsimony analysis led to eight fully resolved most\nparsimonious trees (L=1084). The topology of the taxa basal to the\n“distal erigonines” remained unchanged and the “distal erigonines” still\nshare 67 % of all nodes with the original analysis. The Savignia-group\nis not monophyletic on genus level with respect to Saloca diceros and\nAlioranus pastoralis and also on species level in Diplocephalus and\nErigonella. From the Savignia-group, Glyphesis servulus, Diplocephalus\ncristatus, Savignia frontata and two representatives each of Erigonella,\nDicymbium and Araeoncus, form a monophyletic clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1-2","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erigoninae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6713.phy"}]}
