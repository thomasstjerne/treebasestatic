Sequences from the plastid markers rpoC1, matK-trnK and\natpB-rbcL and the nuclear marker ITS, were analyzed using Maximum\nParsimony and Bayesian Inference. Monophyly of subtribe Chloraeinae was\nconfirmed, as well as its position inside tribe Cranichideae. Neither\nChloraea nor Bipinnula were recovered as monophyletic. Gavilea turned\nout polyphyletic, with Chloraea chica embedded in the genus while\nGavilea supralabellata was related to Chloraea and may be a hybrid\nbetween both genera. The new combination, Gavilea chica, is proposed to\nmaintain the genus Gavilea monophyletic. None of the two sections of\nGavilea were monophyletic, and the topologies obtained do not suggest a\nnew division of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gavilea, strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47414.phy"},{"tree_label":"tnt 1++","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gavilea ITS MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47416.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gavilea, Bayesian summary","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47417.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gavilea, Bayesian summary","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47415.phy"}]}
