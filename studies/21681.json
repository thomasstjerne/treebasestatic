It is characterized by having\nresupinate basidiomata with oblique tube layer, with fusoid cystidioles\npresenting in hymenium, and cylindrical basidiospores. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions strongly\nsupported R. tianshanensis as a distinctive species belonging to\nRhodonia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110251.phy"}]}
