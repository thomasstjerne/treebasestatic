This syndrome\nis characterized by the typical stem pitting on the wood with gum\ndeposits in the bark of Volkamer lemon, similar to the viroid diseases\nof the cachexia in mandarin and the gummy bark in sweet orange. Citrus\nviroids have therefore been indicated as presumed causal agents of the\ngummy bark disease of Volkamer lemon. This disease is devastating many\ncitrus groves in the newly reclaimed land of Egypt, where the Volkamer\nlemon is largely used for its adaptability to arid zones. Molecular\ninvestigations carried out in this study on symptomatic and asymptomatic\ntrees have confirmed the presence of different citrus viroids. Hop stunt\nviroid (HSVd) and Citrus bark cracking (CBCVd) were the prevalent\nviroids in the symptomatic trees, mainly as mixed infections. The\nseverity of symptoms in biological indexing (stem pitting and cracking),\ninduced by both agents indicated that the disease could be a result of a\nsynergic action of HSVd and CBCVd.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Viroids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128389.phy"}]}
