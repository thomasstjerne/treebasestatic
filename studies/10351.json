This species also shares features with several, commonly\noccurring, previously described Australian Hebeloma species. An\nintegrated morphological and molecular study has resulted in the\nconclusion that all Anamika species belong in Hebeloma. As a result,\nalready described species of Anamika are recombined as H. indica (K.A\nThomas, Peintner, M.M. Moser and Manim.) B.J.Rees, H. angustilamellata\n(Zhu,L.Yang and Z.W.Ge) B.J.Rees and H. lactariolens (Clémençon and\nHongo) B.J.Rees. A phylogenetic tree based on ribosomal ITS sequences\nexamines the relationship of these species with other Hebeloma species\nfrom both hemispheres. Six new species, Hebeloma youngii B.J.Rees, H.\nnothofagetorum B.J.Rees, H. galetteliforme C.L.Austin and B.J Rees, H.\nsubvictoriense B.J.Rees, H. lacteocoffeatum B.J.Rees and H. hygrosarx\nB.J.Rees are described from Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian tree Fig. 8","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7259","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7259.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict tree Fig. 7","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7258","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7258.phy"}]}
