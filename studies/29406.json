As such, a\nstudy has been conducted combining previously unused morphological data\n(chloroplast features) with molecular characters (sequences of nuclear\nSSU, LSU and plastid encoded SSU rDNA) and extensive literature studies.\nThe research was executed on environmental samples obtained from Poland\nand China and resulted in 51 new sequences representing three genetic\nmarkers (17 nSSU, 16 nLSU and 18 cpSSU rDNA), what allowed the emending\nof the diagnostic descriptions of genus Strombomonas and its type\nspecies, S. verrucosa. In addition, nine species were distinguished and\ntaxonomically verified: S. acuminata, S. borystheniensis, S. eurystoma,\nS. fluviatilis, S. gibberosa, S. maxima, S. ovalis, S. triquetra, S.\nschauinslandii; among them three were new to the phylogenetic tree (S.\nfluviatilis, S. gibberosa and S. schauinslandii). In order to improve\nthe efficiency of DNA isolation from loricate cells, a protocol\nutilizing a chelating resin for DNA isolation  following the lead of\ndiatomologists  has been adjusted for euglenids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135614","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135614.phy"}]}
