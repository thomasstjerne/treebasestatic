The assertion that\nmyxozoans are highly reduced cnidarians is supported by the presence of\npolar capsules, which resemble cnidarian stinging structures called\nnematocysts. Our study characterizes the genomes and transcriptomes of\ntwo distantly related myxozoan species, Kudoa iwatai and Myxobolus\ncerebralis, and another cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme. A\nphylogenomic analysis, using the most extensive sampling of myxozoans to\ndate, confirms the phylogenetic position of myxozoans within Cnidaria,\nwith Polypodium as the sister taxon to Myxozoa. Analyses of myxozoan\ngenomes indicate that the transition to the highly reduced body plan was\naccompanied by massive reduction in genome size, including depletion of\ngenes considered hallmarks of animal multicellularity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian CAT Model","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylobayes CAT model","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88326.phy"}]}
