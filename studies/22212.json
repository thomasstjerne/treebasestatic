Phylogenetic relationships within\nthe spruce genus remain unclear due to previous inconsistent results. In\nthis study, we carried out phylogenetic analyses of Picea species using\nsequence variations from both plastome and nuclear genome from 27\nspecies/varieties, including 16 from China, three from Europe, and eight\nfrom North America. Our genome phylogenies indicate that the deepest\nsplits among surviving spruce lineages occurred in North America. Four\nmajor clades, comprising three to 12 species/varieties each, were\nconsistently recovered across all phylogenies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109762","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109762.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109764.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109771.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109763","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109763.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109772","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109772.phy"}]}
