In a phylogenetic\nframework the evolutionary history of homologous elements may be traced,\nand the nucleotide sequence of elements at or close to the time of\ninsertion can be reconstructed. Based on a phylogeny of the diploid\nspecies of the genus Hordeum we explore evolutionary aspects of four\nnon-homologous groups of Stowaway elements inserted into three nuclear\ngenes: nucellin, xylose isomerase, and barley leucine zipper 1. The data\nillustrate how elements from a high degree of sequence similarity\nbetween terminal inverted repeat regions gradually degrade, and confirm\nprevious notions about preferential insertion at particular TA target\nsites. It is shown how creation of consensus sequences as estimates of\nancestral elements may be positively misleading. The Stowaway family of\ntransposable elements is often further divided into subfamilies based on\nsequence similarity between element. Sequence similarity data from the\nelements discovered in the xylose isomerase gene and other element found\nthrough BLAST searches in GenBank, reveal inconsistency of the rules\nused for classification. In order to reflect natural groups a\nclassification of transposable elements must be based on phylogenetic\nevidence rather than raw similarity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hordeum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5329.phy"}]}
