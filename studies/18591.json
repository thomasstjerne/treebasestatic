In this article we\nstudied 12 specimens of this group according to the morphological and\nphylogenetic results. Our 8-gene-sequence dataset included 61 ITS, 48\nLSU, 29 EF-1Î±, 28 mtSSU, 18 Î²-tubulin, 16 RPB1, 20 RPB2 and 25 nucSSU\nsequences. The phylogenetic result indicates that group Melanopus is not\na monophyletic assemblage with black stipes. Based on phylogenetic\nevidence and morphological characters, four new species in Melanopus\nclade, P. baishanzuensis, P. subtropicus, P. subtubaeformis and P.\ntibeticus, are newly described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_92224.phy"}]}
