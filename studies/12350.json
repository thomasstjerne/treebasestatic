Therefore, Chilean apple production must fulfill the\nsanitization requirements imposed by the receiving countries. Under\nthese circumstances, it was important to clarify the etiology of bullâs\neye rot that can severely affect âCripps Pinkâ apples and other\nlate-harvest cultivars in Chile. On the basis of morphological\ncharacters and the partial sequence analysis of the internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS) sequences and Î²-tubulin genes, Neofabraea alba was\nidentified as the causal agent of the bullâs eye rot of Chilean apples.\nThese results were further corroborated using species-specific primers.\nHowever, the expression of symptoms varied from brown to yellow, flat to\nsunken spherical lesions, often with concentric rings. The isolates of\nN. alba were pathogenic in âCripps Pinkâ apples, and the prevalence of\nbull’s eye rot varied considerably, for instance, in 2009, 0.0 to 58.7%\nin 38 âCripps Pinkâ orchards surveyed in the relatively arid and humid\napple-growing areas of Chile, respectively. There was no evidence for\nthe presence of N. malicorticis or N. perennans, which are the commonly\nidentified causal agents of bullâs eye rot in other apple-producing\ncountries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51730","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51730.phy"}]}
