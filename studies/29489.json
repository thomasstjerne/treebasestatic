Importance of these\nspecies vary from food sources to landscape. Therefore, identification\nand characterization of pathogens associated with these hosts have\neconomic and ecological signifi-cant. During sample survey in 2020ï€­2021,\nleaf spots on diseased Sabal mexicana, and roting tis-sues of Areca\ntriandra, Arenga pinnata, Dypsis leptocheilos, Washingtonia robusta were\ncollected from three cities in southwestern China. Fungal identification\nof all isolates was performed using mor-phological characterization and\nphylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregion of ribosomal DNA, tub2 genes and part of the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (TEF). In total, Six Neopestalotiopsis\nisolates and 22 Pestalotiopsis isolates were obtained. These iso-lates\nwere further confirmed as three species were described as new species,\nP. areca, P. guang-dongnsis, P. Sabal, while the other two were reported\nas known species, namely N. formicarum, P. kandelicola, and the\nremaining one was not be assigned to any new taxa. Kent showed that\nrepre-sentative isolates of the new species and new record species\nisolated and identified in this study and induce weak lesions on Sabal\nmexicana leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135831.phy"}]}
