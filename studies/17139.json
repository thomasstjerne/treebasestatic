A phylogenetic analysis based on the\nmitochondrial DNA fragments 16S and COI and the nuclear marker wingless,\nand a phylogeographic analysis using a COI fragment were carried out on\ntwo subspecies of Cosmodela aurulenta (C. a. juxtata and C. a.\naurulenta). The results support the hypothesis that these two subspecies\nare significantly different to be considered as separate species that\ndiverged around 1.5 MYBP. TAXONDNA analysis was used to investigate the\ncapability of the COI region as a marker for discriminating both\nentities and to quantify intra and inter-taxa genetic variation. The\nminimum distance between C. aurulenta and C. juxtata was 2.7837%, and no\noverlap of intra and inter-taxa genetic divergence was observed. Both\ntaxa, here considered as valid species, occur in sympatry in the Malay\nPeninsula, with C. aurulenta most probably originating from the area and\nC. juxtata a secondary colonizer that expanded southwards from the Asian\nmainland. Our data infer a continental origin of the Indonesian samples\nof C. aurulenta, and they most likely dispersed across the land bridges\nthat emerged during glacial maxima to form Sundaland.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COIWG_And12","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85777","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85777.phy"},{"tree_label":"COIWG_Pap10","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85778.phy"},{"tree_label":"COIWG_Pons11","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85779.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOIWG_And12","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85780","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85780.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOIWG_Pons11","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85782","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85769.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOI_Pap10","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85772","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85772.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOI_Pons11","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85773","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85773.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SWG_And12","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85774","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85774.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_Pap10","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85763","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85763.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_And12","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85762","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85762.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_Pons11","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85764","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85764.phy"},{"tree_label":"WG_And12","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85768","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85768.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SWG_Pap10","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85775","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85775.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SWG_Pons11","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85776","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85776.phy"},{"tree_label":"WG_Pons11","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85770","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85770.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOI_And12","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85771.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_And12","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85765.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_Pons11","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85767","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85767.phy"},{"tree_label":"16SCOIWG_Pap10","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85781","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85781.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_And12","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85765","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85782.phy"},{"tree_label":"WG_And12","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85768","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85766.phy"}]}
