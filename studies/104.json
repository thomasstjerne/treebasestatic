{"Authors":" J. R. Estes, Henry Loconte","Year":" 1989","Title":" Phylogenetic systematics of Berberidaceae and Ranunculales\n(Magnoliidae).","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 14","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 565-579","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Based on a cladistic study employing outgroup comparison\nand parsimony analysis of 34 genera within Ranunculales, we infer that\nBerberidaceae, Lardizabalaceae, Menispermaceae, and Ranunculaceae are\nmonophyletic groups. Berberidaceae and Lardizabalaceae are sister groups\nwith the synapomorphies of compound leaves and flowers with a biseriate\nandroecium. The sister group of (Berberidaceae-Lardizabalaceae) remains\nunresolved, as we find equally parsimonious positions for Menispermaceae\nand Ranunculaceae. Earlier proposals to associate Berberidaceae with\nRanunculaceae, and Lardizabalaceae with Menispermaceae appear to be\nbased on plesiomorphies and convergence. The subordinated hierarchy for\nLardizabalaceae is summarized as:\n(Decaisneoideae-(Sinofranchetieae-Lardizabaleae)), with Decaisneoideae\nand Sinofranchetieae recognized as a new subfamily and tribe,\nrespectively. Sargentodoxa is the sister taxon of Boquila within\nLardizabaleae. The classification for Berberidaceae is summarized as:\n(Nandinoideae-(Leonticeae-(Berberidinae-Epimediinae))). The subtribe\nEpimediinae, characterized by striate pollen exine and a chromosome base\nnumber of x = 6, comprises the Epimedium group, the Podophyllum group,\nand Bongardia. The resemblance of Bongardia and Leontice is the result\nof convergent evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ranunculales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1418.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ranunculales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1417.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ranunculales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1416.phy"}]}
