This novel taxon was isolated from dead branches of\nCorylus avellana (common hazel) in Italy. The discovery of this new\ngenus with both sexual and asexual characters will contribute to expand\nthe knowledge and taxonomic framework of Bambusicolaceae.Corylicola gen.\nnov. shares similar morphological characters to species of\nBambusicolaceae in having solitary, scattered, globose to subglobose and\nostiolate ascomata, anastomosing and branching pseudoparaphyses,\ncylindrical asci with a well-developed ocular chamber and short furcate\npedicel and 1-septate ascospores. The coelomycetous asexual morph of\nCorylicola gen. nov.has holoblastic, phialidic conidiogenous cells and\nlight brown conidia similar to species of Bambusicolaceae. Corylicola\ngen. nov. differs from the other genera of Bambusicolaceae in having\nyellowish brown ascospores masses at the top of ascomatal neck. Detailed\nmorphological illustrations with comprehensive descriptions for the\nnovel taxon and key to genera of Bambusicolaceae are provided. Maximum\nlikelihood analysis and Bayesian phylogenetic inference of a combined\nSSU, LSU, ITS, RPB2 and TEF1 sequence dataset confirmed its placement as\na distinct lineage in Bambusicolaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124695","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124695.phy"}]}
