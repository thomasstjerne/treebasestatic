I summarize the methods used to address issues relating\nto sampling and the formation of OTUs for this monograph, and emphasize\nthe importance of incorporating morphological character data in a total\nevidence phylogenetic analysis. In addition to a traditional Linnaean\ntaxonomic treatment, I provide rank-free definitions of the terminal\ntaxa in the S. involutus complex. Following the PhyloCode\nrecommendations for the designation and naming of more inclusive taxa, I\npresent a novel method for naming terminal taxa as least-inclusive\nclades. This monographic treatment represents a first attempt at\napplying the PhyloCode at the terminal level in any plant group, and\nrecognizes five distinct taxa in the S. involutus complex, which I have\ndesignated with the rank-free clade name Leucophanella: banksii,\nborneensis, involutus, rufescens, and revolutus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Syrrhopodon involutus complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2143.phy"}]}
