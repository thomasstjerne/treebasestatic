This is the\nfirst published record of Wawelia for more than 20 years, the only\nrecord outside Europe and the only discovery in the world made in the\nfield, despite the fact that the genus was described in 1908. This new\ntaxon is characterized by the longest stromata in the genus reaching 120\nmm, ascospores with polar pad-like appendages and asci with a remarkable\namyloid apical apparatus, which is unique within the genus. The genus is\naccommodated within the family Xylariaceae together with other\ncoprophilous fungi, which is proved by the phylogenetic analysis with\npartial sequences of ITS, benA and RPB2, the latter two being obtained\nfor the first time for a Wawelia. A complete bibliography on the genus\nis given and a comparative table with all known species is\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Wawelia Bayesian PP Tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134082","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134082.phy"}]}
