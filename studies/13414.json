Morphological characters of\nthese cultures were described and compared with type specimen and the\noriginal descriptions. Phylogenetical analyses based on ITS and\nmulti-locus alignments sequences indicated that Guignardia bidwellii\ncomplex should be split into P. ampelicida and another species. Our\nresults denied the teleomorph/anamorph connection between P. vaccinii\nand G. vaccinii, as they represent different species. Multi-locus\nsequence data from the neotype and epitype were generated and deposited\nin GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, GPDH, ACT and EF\nsequences were conducted to infer the evolutionary relationships of two\nspecies with other closely related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59135","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59135.phy"}]}
