The results\nprovide evidence for three dispersal events within Styrax to the\nAntilles, one from southern North America, the other two from South\nAmerica. The data do not support a strict Greater Antillean vicariance\nscenario for Styrax. Vicariance between the Greater Antilles and\nsouthern North America without immediate prior dispersal would require a\nmore basal position of Styrax ochraceus than that recovered, although\nlow branch support values in the relevant portion of the tree do not\npreclude this possibility. Dispersal of Styrax from South America to the\nGreater Antilles could have proceeded across oceanic barriers, or more\nlikely through GAARlandia. Styrax obtusifolius in Cuba and Hispa√íiola\nand the strictly South American Foveolaria clade have evolved small\nflowers and the gynodioecious condition independently. The predominance\nof microscopic pollinators in the Cuban fauna may have impelled the\nevolution of small flowers in Styrax obtusifolius. The data suggest that\nthe Antilles have played little if any role in the intercontinental\ndispersal of Styrax.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Styrax","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4382.phy"}]}
