Spores of S. fuscum usually occur in loose\nhypogeous clusters, rarely singly in soil or inside roots, and S.\nfurcatum forms only single spores in soil. Spores of S. fuscum are\nbrownish orange to dark brown, globose to subglobose, (20-)47(-90) Âµm\ndiam, rarely ovoid, 21-50 x 23-60 Âµm. Their spore wall consists of a\nsemi-persistent, semi-flexible, orange white to golden yellow, rarely\nhyaline, outer layer, easily separating from a laminate, smooth,\nbrownish orange to dark brown inner layer. Spores of S. furcatum are\nreddish brown to dark brown, globose to subglobose, (106-)138(-167) Âµm\ndiam, rarely ovoid; 108-127 x 135-160 Âµm, usually with one subtending\nhypha that is frequently branched below the spore base, or occasionally\nwith two subtending hyphae located close together. Their spore wall\nconsists of a semi-permanent, hyaline to light orange outermost layer, a\nsemi-permanent, hyaline to golden yellow middle layer, and a laminate,\nsmooth, reddish brown to dark brown innermost layer. None of the spore\nwall layers of S. fuscum and S. furcatum stains in Melzerâs reagent. In\nthe field, S. fuscum was associated with roots of Arctotheca populifolia\ncolonizing maritime dunes located near Strand in South Africa, and S.\nfurcatum was associated with Cordia oncocalyx growing in a dry forest in\nthe CerÃ¡ State, Brazil. In single-species cultures with Plantago\nlanceolata as host plant, S. fuscum and S. furcatum formed arbuscular\nmycorrhizae. Phylogenetic analyses of the SSU, ITS and LSU nrDNA\nsequences placed the two new species in genus Septoglomus and both new\ntaxa were separated from described Septoglomus species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootstrap 6","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57417","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57417.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57411","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_57411.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 7","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57418","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57418.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57414","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57414.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 11","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57422","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57422.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 19","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57430","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57430.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 16","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57427","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57427.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 28","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57439","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57439.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 25","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57436","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57436.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 13","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57424","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57424.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 21","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57432","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57432.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 24","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57435","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57435.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 26","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57437","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57437.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 27","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57438","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57438.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57413","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57413.phy"}]}
