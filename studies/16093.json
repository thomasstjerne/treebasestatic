The\npresent study focused on the identification of resting-stage algae from\nfreshwater sediments in Paldang Dam Lake, an important source of water\nfor South Korea. We examined the morphological characteristics of\nresting-stage specimens and identified them by germination experiments\nor DNA analysis. Surface sediment samples were collected from 12 sites\nin Paldang Dam Lake from July 2009 to June 2010. Thirty-five resting\nstage morphotypes were identified: 19 chlorophytes, 6 dinoflagellates, 5\ndiatoms, 2 cyanobacteria, 2 euglenoids and 1 cryptophyte. Resting-stage\nand vegetative cells of five chlorophyte morphotypes could not be\nidentified by morphology. These specimens were identified by molecular\nsequence analysis based on the nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA sequences of\nPolyedriopsis, Oogamochlamys and Chlamydomonas. Our samples included\nresting-stage of the potentially toxic species Cylindrospermum stagnale,\nthe first recorded sighting in Korea. Resting-stage assemblages were\ndominated by diatoms, which ranged from 560 to 2750 cells gâ1.\nResting-stage of diatoms and cyanobacteria were abundant along the\neastern shore toward the southern part of Paldang Dam Lake, where there\nhave been periodic algal blooms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Freshwater Algae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76253.phy"}]}
