Our previous studies\nshowed that there are two phylotypes of these truffles, both of which\nfell into the T. indicum complex. However, their taxonomic treatment is\nstill unclear. In this study, we conducted morphological and\nphylogenetic analyses for a total of 43 specimens that originated from\nJapan (10 each for two Tuber taxa described hereafter as Tuber sp. 6 and\nTuber sp. 7), China (10 T. himalayense and eight T. indicum), and Taiwan\nIsland, China (five T. formosanum). We compared ascospore ornamentation,\nsize, distribution of asci with different number of spores, spine\nheight, and spine bases of the Japanese specimens with their allied\ntaxa. For phylogenetic analysis, we sequenced two mating loci (MAT1-1-1\nand MAT1-2-1) and three commonly used loci. Three distinct lineages were\nrecognized by phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the two\nmating-related loci and three mating-unrelated loci. The Tuber sp. 6\nsequences clustered with those of T. himalayense and T. formosanum, and\nthere was no clear difference in morphology among them. Tuber sp. 7\nformed a monophyletic clade in each phylogram. The taxa tended to have\nfive-spored asci more frequently than other allied taxa and could be\ncharacterized as having ascospore ornamentation with longer spines and\nnarrower spine bases. We therefore described Tuber sp. 7 as a new\nspecies (T. longispinosum), and treated Tuber sp. 6 and T. formosanum as\nsynonyms of T. himalayense.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105887","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105887.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105886","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105886.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105882","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105882.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105883","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105883.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105884.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105885","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105885.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105890.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105889.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105888","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105888.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105891.phy"}]}
