At least two species are known to produce psychoactive\ncompounds during infection, which has garnered considerable interest for\nthis enigmatic genus. As with many Entomophthorales, the evolutionary\nrelationships and host associations of Massospora spp. are not well\nunderstood. The acquisition of M. diceroproctae from Arizona, M.\ntettigatis from Chile, and M. platypediae from California and Colorado\nprovided an opportunity to conduct molecular phylogenetic analyses and\nmorphological studies to investigate if these fungi represent a\nmonophyletic group and delimit species boundaries. In a three-locus\nphylogenetic analysis including the D1D2 domains of nuc 28S (28S),\nelongation factor 1 alpha-like (EFL), and beta-tubulin (BTUB),\nMassospora was resolved in a strongly supported monophyletic group\ncontaining four well-supported genealogically exclusive lineages, based\non two of three methods of phylogenetic inference. There was\nincongruence among the single-gene trees: two methods of phylogenetic\ninference recovered trees with either the same topology as the 3-gene\nconcatenated tree (EFL), or a basal polytomy (28S, BTUB). Massospora\nlevispora and M. platypediae isolates formed a single lineage in all\nanalyses and are synonymized here as M. levispora. Massospora\ndiceroproctae was sister to M. cicadina in all three single-gene trees\nand on an extremely long branch relative to the other Massospora, and\neven the outgroup taxa, which may reflect an accelerated rate of\nmolecular evolution and/or incomplete taxa sampling. The results of the\nmorphological study presented here indicate that spore measurements may\nnot be phylogenetically or diagnostically informative. Despite recent\nadvances in understanding the ecology of Massospora, much about its host\nrange and diversity remains unexplored. The emerging phylogenetic\nframework can provide a foundation for exploring co-evolutionary\nrelationships with cicada hosts as well as the evolution of\nbehavior-altering compounds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121991.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_19","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122092.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_20","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122093","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122093.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_18","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122091.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_11","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122010","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122010.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_11","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122084.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_16","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122015","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122015.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_17","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122016.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_18","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122017","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122017.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_23","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122022","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122022.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_12","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122085.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_13","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122086.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_24","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122023","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122023.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_25","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122024","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122024.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_16","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122055.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_17","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122056","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122056.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_19","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_25","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122064.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_29","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122068.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_72","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122069.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_14","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122087.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_26","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122065.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_27","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122066.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_19","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122018","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122018.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122077.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_5","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_20","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122019","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122019.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_26","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122099.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_27","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122100.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_14","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122053","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122053.phy"},{"tree_label":"con
