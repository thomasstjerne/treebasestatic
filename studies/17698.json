The\nisolation of this culture permitted morphological study of colony\ncharacters, conidium and conidiophore development, and phylogenetic\ninvestigations using sequences of nuc 18S rDNA, internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS), and 28S rDNA. The results indicate that Diploӧspora rosea\nis an onygenalean fungus, of uncertain taxonomic position, basal or\nsister to the Gymnoascaceae. Based on observations of the parchments\nusing SEM-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, we speculate that the fungus\noccurs in archival and domestic environments subject to periodic\nwetting. Its ability to grow on all low water activity media used in the\nstudy, including malt extract agar amended with 60% sucrose, confirms\nits xerophilic nature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule SSU LSU","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diploospora rosea ssu lsu","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88021.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule ITS","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diploospora rosea its","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88022.phy"}]}
