The type species, P. indicum, is morphologically\nsimilar to the marine genus Zalerion in the production of helicosporous,\nirregularly coiled conidia and knots of thick-walled brown cells. In\ncontrast to Zalerion, the novel genus is terrestrial and its knots of\ncells are produced by the intertwining of groups of conidia, not from a\nsingle conidial filament as in Zalerion. While Zalerion belongs in the\norder Halosphaeriales (Sordariomycetes), Parazalerion is probably\nrelated to the phylogenetically distant class Dothideomycetes","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110726","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110726.phy"}]}
