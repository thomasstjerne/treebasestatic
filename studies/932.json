In order to reveal the most\nreliable data set and more fully elucidate the phylogenetic\nrelationships of Chaetosphaeria and its anamorphs, we sequenced a\nportion of the large nuclear rDNA (LSU rDNA) and the complete ITS region\n(ITS1, the 5.8S rDNA gene and ITS2) of 23 taxa that represent 8 anamorph\ngenera of Chaetosphaeria and 2 other sexual taxa: Striatosphaeria and\nPorosphaerella. Four phylogenetic analyses were performed, each based on\ndifferent data sets. The phylogenies inferred from both ITS and LSU rDNA\nsequence data showed four main subgroups within the monophyletic\nChaetosphaeriaceae. These subgroups correspond to certain morphology of\nanamorphs and teleomorphs and serve as a background to distinguish\nChaetosphaeria species into 2, respectively 4 natural groups of taxa.\nThe 2 sexual and 2 related asexual species currently referred to\nChaetosphaeria grouped with taxa of the Hypocreales. The similarity of\ncharacters displayed by these species with the true species of\nChaetosphaeria is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria, 1 of 2 MP trees, LSU 18\nChaetosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_819.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria, 1 of 2 MP trees, LSU 24\nChaetosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria, 1 of 2 MP trees, LSU 43\nascomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria, MP tree, ITS, 25\nChaetosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_818.phy"}]}
