For over a\ndecade, biologists have endeavored to distinguish orthology (homology\ncaused by speciation) from paralogy (homology caused by duplication).\nDisentangling orthology and paralogy is useful to diverse fields such as\nphylogenetics, protein engineering, and genome content comparison. A\ncommon step in ortholog detection is the computation of Bidirectional\nBest Hits (BBH). However, we found this computation impractical for more\nthan 24 Eukaryotic proteomes. Attempting to retrieve orthologs in less\ntime than previous methods require, we developed a novel algorithm and\nimplemented it as a suite of Perl scripts. This software, Selectable\nTaxon Ortholog Retrieval Iteratively (STORI), retrieves orthologous\nprotein sequences for a set of user-defined proteomes and query\nsequences. While the time complexity of the BBH method is quadratic to\nthe number of taxa, we found that the average CPU time used by STORI may\nincrease linearly with the number of taxa. To demonstrate one aspect of\nSTORIÂ’s usefulness, we used this software to infer the orthologous\nsequences of 26 ribosomal proteins (rProteins) from the large ribosomal\nsubunit (LSU), for a set of 115 Bacterial and 94 Archaeal proteomes.\nNext, we used established tree-search methods to seek the most probable\nevolutionary explanation of these data. The current implementation of\nSTORI runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 with installations of Moab\n5.3.7, Perl 5 and several Perl modules.
