Arenysaurus is characterized by having a very prominent\nfrontal dome; nearly vertical prequadratic (squamosal) and jugal\n(postorbital) processes, and deltopectoral crest of the humerus oriented\nanteriorly. Moreover, it possesses a unique combination of characters:\nshort frontal (length/width approximately 0.5); midline ridge of\nparietal at level of the postorbitalsquamosal bar; parietal excluded\nfrom the occiput; squamosal low above the cotyloid cavity. A\nphylogenetical analysis indicates that Arenysaurus is a rather basal\nmember of Lambeosaurinae and the sister-taxon to Amurosaurus and the\nCorythosaurini-Parasaurolophini clade. The phylogenetic and\nbiogeographical relationships of Arenysaurus and other lambeosaurines\nsuggest a palaeogeographical connection between Asia and Europe during\nthe Late Cretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55987.phy"}]}
