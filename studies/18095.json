Tropical regions show a remarkable diversity of this genus\nwhere they play an essential role in litter decomposition in forest\necosystems. Singer (1958, 1976, 1986) who had a major role in developing\nthe generic and infrageneric circumscriptions of Marasmius recognized 11\nsections within Marasmius and this classification system was widely\naccepted until the end of the last century. However, recent molecular\nphylogenetic studies indicate that the genus is polyphyletic and\nMarasmius s.str. includes only the sections Marasmius, Globulares and\nSicci (Moncalvo et al. 2002; Wilson & Desjardin 2005; Matheny et\nal. 2006). The section Globulares is characterized primarily by a\nhymeniform pileipellis with smooth elements, dextrinoid tramal hyphae,\nand a mycelium at the stipe base (Singer 1976; Antonín 2007).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius odoratus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97446.phy"}]}
