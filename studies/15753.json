Pure culture was\nprepared by tissue culture on Malt-extract-agar (MEA) medium at\n25C±2C. The specimen was studied for its identification, taxonomy and\nphylogeny and identified as Lentinus sajor-caju by morphological and\nmicroscopical studies. The identification was confirmed through ITS 5.8S\nrDNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Its cultivation was done on saw\ndust and wheat bran. The fruit bodies were obtained at a temperature of\n28±2°C and 80-85% RH. The cultivated Lentinus sajor-caju fruit bodies\nwere analysed for nutritional and biological properties and observed\nthat the cultivated mushroom has good nutritional properties while\nantioxidant, reducing and DPPH free radical scavenging properties are\ncomparable to commercially cultivated Lentinula edodes strains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Blast guide tree","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr74802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_74802.phy"}]}
