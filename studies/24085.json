In this study, we introduce three novel\nspecies isolated from Halimione portulacoides, saline water and dead\nleaves of Zostera noltii of two saline environments analysing their\nmorphology and phylogeny based on ITS sequences. However, it is\nessential a combination of sequence data using more specific genes for a\nrobust phylogenetic analysis and species delimitation to resolve these\ntaxa. N. aestuarinum, N. endophyticum and N. halimiones are provided\nwith morphological descriptions and compared with phylogenetically close\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocamarosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117318.phy"}]}
