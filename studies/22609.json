Chinese entities are distinct from\npreviously described species of Hygrophorus, including the European H.\nrussula. Therefore, we describe it as a new species, namely H.\nparvirussula sp. nov., which differs from H. russula by its smaller\nbasidiomata, slightly larger basidiospores, and the presence of\ncheilocystidia and pleurocystidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hygrophorus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118674.phy"}]}
