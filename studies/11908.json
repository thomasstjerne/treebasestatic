We investigated the diversity and phylogeny of Japanese\nOctaviania specimens using a multifaceted approach including scanning\nand transmission electron microscopy as well as analysis of nuclear\nribosomal DNA (ITS and LSU) and EF-1Î± (tef1) sequences. Phylogenetic\nanalyses indicate that the genus Octaviania is divided into three major\nclades, and that there are at least 12 species-level lineages in Japan.\nAccordingly, we describe two new subgenera, Parcaea and Fulvoglobus, and\neleven new species. Subgenus Parcaea accommodates four highly divergent,\nbut macromorphologically almost undiscernible cryptic species. We\ndiscuss not only the diversity and species delimitation within the genus\nOctaviania but also the phylogeography of the Japanese taxa and their\nrelatives.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Preliminary NJ tree for Fig. 4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Octaviania, ITS preliminary NJ tree for network\nanalysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Octaviania, EF1-alpha Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Octaviania, LSU Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Octaviania, nLSU+EF1alpha Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50940.phy"}]}
