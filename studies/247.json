The basis to\nthis discussion is a cladistic analysis of 141 morphological characters\n(172 apomorphic states) scored for 97 genera. The Heleniae s. lato, a\nsubgroup of the Heliantheae s. lato, are paraphyletic, and a\nmonophyletic group corresponding largely to the Heliantheae s. str. is\nrecognized. The Ecliptinae sensu ROBINSON are polyphyletic. The\nCoreopsidinae form an ingroup in the Heliantheae s. str. The Tageteae\n(Pectidinae) and the Madieae (Madiinae) are two separate branches within\nthe helenioida assemblage of taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6, 7","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heliantheae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1301.phy"}]}
