Among them, marine microorganisms have risen as a source of\nbioactive compounds with the advantage to be able to obtain unlimited\nand constant amounts of the compounds in contrast to other natural\nsources such as plants. Furthermore, marine actinomycetes have recently\nbeen reported as highly rich in bioactive agents including\nsalinosporamides, xiamycines, indolocarbazoles, naphtyridines, phenols,\ndilactones such as antimycines, macrolides among others. In this study,\nStaurosporine (STS) was isolated from a strain of Streptomyces sanyensis\nand tested against both stages of Acanthamoeba sp. with the aim to\ndevelop STS therapeutic potential against this protozoan. Furthermore,\nand after establishing low toxicity, the mechanism of action of STS was\nevaluated. The obtained results concluded that STS is active against\nboth stages of Acanthamoeba life cycle and also activates killing of the\nparasite by activation of Programmed Cell Death via the mitochondrial\npathway.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118856.phy"}]}
