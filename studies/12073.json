Within the S. reflexum complex\nITS data are frequently congruent with morphology, but incongruence\nbetween these data sets is abundant. According to ITS S. tromsoeense and\nS. latifolium are polyphyletic, S. altaicum, some specimens of S.\noedipodium, and S. curtum S. starkei intermediates cannot be\ndistinguished from S. reflexum, and S. fuegianum is identical with S.\nglaciale. There is no evidence to suggest that ITS a priori is more\nreliable than morphology, and we therefore suggest that the abundant\nincongruent patterns can be referred to a young age of the S. reflexum\ncomplex. Incomplete lineage sorting, occasional hybridisation, faster\nmorphological than ITS evolution, and regional differences in extinction\nrates during the Pleistocene glaciations are suggested as possible\nexplanations for the incongruence revealed, but additional information\nis required to decide which is/are most important. Three species, S.\nsichuanicum, S. sinolatifolium, and S. squarrosum, are described as new\nbased on the molecular relationships found and morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49307","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49307.phy"}]}
