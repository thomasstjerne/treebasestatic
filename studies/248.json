Cladograms rooted with Nicotiana tabacum were constructed\nwith Wagner and Dollo parsimony. Strict consensus trees indicate that\nHebecladus onginated from within Jaltomata; together these genera are\nmonophyletic and constitute the recently circumscribed genus Jaltomata.\nThere are two primary clades in Jaltomata: one a morphologically diverse\ngroup confined to western (largely Andean) South America, the Greater\nAntilles, and the Galapagos Islands; and the othcr a morphologically\nhomogeneous group widely distributed from the southwestern United States\nto Bolivia. The controversial Leucophysalis viscosa, formerly treated as\nJaltomata viscosa, is related to Leucophysalis, Physalis, Chamaesaracha,\nand Margaranthus; it does not group with any of the sampled species of\nJaltomata. Physalis appears to be polyphyletic since P. alkekengi of the\nOld World branches off prior to a clade including Chamaesaracha,\nMargaranthus, and the two New World Physalis species sampled.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Jaltomata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Jaltomata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1303.phy"}]}
