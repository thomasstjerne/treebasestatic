Neorhamphoria is\ncharacterized by its dark apothecial ascomata, broad cellular\npseudoparaphyses, with bitunicate, broad-clavate asci, and hyaline,\nmuriform ascospores. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU,\nSSU and TEF1α sequence data indicate that Neorhamphoria belongs in\nDothideomycetes and is related to Tubeufiales. Morphologically,\nNeorhamphoria differs from all genera of Tubeufiales and thus we treat\nit as a new genus in Tubeufiales, genus incertae sedis","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubeufiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110625.phy"}]}
