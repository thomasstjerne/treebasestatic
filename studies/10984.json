It is well circumscribed by having a basidiome\nwith decurrent and distant white gills with evident pink-lilac tinges at\nmaturity, well developed cheilocystidia, and echinulate globose spores.\nThe study includes a description, color photographs of fresh basidiomes\nand line drawings of relevant microscopic traits. N. dominicanus is very\nclose to Neopaxillus echinospermus, the type species of the genus\nNeopaxillus. Based on comparative ITS-LSU rDNA gene sequence analyses,\nNeopaxillus, a genus formerly placed in Boletales, is considered within\nAgaricales and it is basal or sister to Crepidotus (Crepidotaceae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopaxillus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26203.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopaxillus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26202.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopaxillus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26201.phy"}]}
