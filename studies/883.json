With all related New\nWorld genera designated as outgroups, a phylogenetic analysis of\ncombined data reveals a strongly supported monophyletic Phaseolus. Other\nwell supported relationships include nine monophyletic species clades\nwithin Phaseolus, designated as the P. vulgaris, P. filiformis, P.\nlunatus, P. polystachios, P. leptostachyus, P. pauciflorus, P.\ntuerckheimii, and P. pedicellatus groups, and P. microcarpus. Only the\nlast of these is monotypic and consistently resolved in a sensitivity\nanalysis as the earliest branch in the Phaseolus clade, though with poor\nbootstrap support. The five most commonly domesticated species in the\ngenus arise from within the P. vulgaris and P. lunatus groups. The gene\npools traditionally recognized for the domesticated species P. vulgaris\nand P. lunatus are not detected with ITS sequence variation. This is in\nspite of a very high degree of inter- and intra-specific ITS sequence\ndivergence in Phaseolus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2, 3","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaseolus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5698.phy"}]}
