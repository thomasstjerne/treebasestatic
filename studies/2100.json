The\nresults of numerical analysis support the recognition of six new species\nwithin the Carex divulsa aggregate, which are also in accordance with\ntheir geographical circumscription. Carex cyprica is endemic to Cyprus,\nC. enokii is from the Mediterranean Basin, C. magacis from the mountains\nof Spain and France, C. nordica from Northern Europe, and C. egorovae\nand C. otomana from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The morphological\ndata were coded and used in a phylogenetic analysis to discover the\nrelationships between taxa. A key to all taxa belonging to the aggregate\nis included. Diagnostic characters, illustrations, and detailed\ndescriptions of all species are given. Notes on the habitat,\ndistribution, phenology, etymology, and conservation status of each\ntaxon are also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex divulsa aggregate","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5217.phy"}]}
