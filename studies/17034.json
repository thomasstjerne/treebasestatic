Several\nspecies were subsequently transferred to Sarocladium, but the\nrelationships between both genera remained unresolved. Based on\nmultilocus phylogenetic inferences combined with phenotypic data, we\nhave revised the species concepts within Sarocladium and some\ngenetically related species of Acremonium. As a result of these studies,\nsix species are described as new, viz. S. bifurcatum, S. gamsii, S.\nhominis, S. pseudostrictum, S. subulatum and S. summerbellii. In\naddition, the new combinations S. implicatum and S. terricola are\nproposed for A. implicatum and A. terricola, respectively. Sarocladium\nattenuatum is confirmed as synonym of the type species of the genus, S.\noryzae. An epitype and neotype are also introduced for S. oryzae and S.\nimplicatum, respectively. Although Sarocladium species have\ntraditionally been considered as important phytopathogens, the genus\nalso contains opportunistic human pathogens. This study extends the\nspectrum of clinical species that could be diagnosed as causal agents of\nhuman infections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sarocladium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85679.phy"}]}
