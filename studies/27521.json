Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined SSU, LSU\nand ITS sequence data were performed to clarify the phylogenetic\naffinity of the new species. The new taxon is characterized by\nsemi-immersed to superficial ascomata, thick peridium, branched and\nseptate pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical asci, muriform ascospores and\noverlapping uniseriate ascospores. Alloleptosphaeria species have been\nreported from England, Italy, Thailand and this is the first report of\nthis genus in China. Detailed descriptions, micrographs and phylogenetic\ndata of the new species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128313","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128313.phy"}]}
