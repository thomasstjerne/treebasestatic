These Southern American species are historically linked to\nCheilanthes marginata, now transfered to the new genus Gaga. The results\nconfirmed that C. hieronymi is a member of Cheilanthes s. s., while C.\npoeppgiana is located outside Gaga and Cheilanthes too. Moreover, the\nstudy ratify that the morphological similarity between the two species\nclearly responds to a convergence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheilanthes matK+rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91009.phy"}]}
