In this study, we newly determined the\nnucleotide sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the 28S rDNA region and the\nsequences of the rDNA ITS region to investigate the relationships\nbetween the phylogeny of this fungal group and their host plants. The\nresults indicated that the 28S rDNA region is too conservative to do a\nphylogenetic analysis of this fungal group. The phylogenetic analysis\nusing 95 ITS sequences demonstrated that two or more Magnicellulatae\ntaxa often infect the same plant genus or species. Although there is a\nclose relationship between Magnicellulatae and asteraceous hosts, this\nassociation seems to be not as strict as that of between Golovinomyces\nand the Asteraceae. The difference between the two fungal groups may be\nexplained by the different evolutionary timing of them.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnicellulatae/ITS95","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnicellulatae/ITS+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6198.phy"}]}
