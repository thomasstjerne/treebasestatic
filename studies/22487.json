It has been\nreported in several countries, but its etiology is controversial,\nattributed to a complex of pathogens. Fifty fungal isolates were sampled\nand identified for genus on the basis of morphology and phylogeny,\nthrough analysis of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS),\ntranslation elongation factor 1- (EF1-), β-tubulin (TUB2), second\nlargest subunit of RNA polymerase (RPB2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (GPDH) and the apn2mat/IGS (ApMAT) genesequences.Seven\nfungal genus and twenty species were identified - Alternaria: A.\ngomphrenae, A. longipes A. tenuissima; Colletotrichum: C. fructicola and\nC. siamense; Fusarium: F. lunatum,F. incarnatum, and F. verticillioides;\nLasiodiplodia: L. euphorbicola, L. iraniensis, L.pseutheobromae, L.\ntheobromaeandLasiodiplodiasp.; Neofusicoccum: N. batangarum;\nNeopestalotiopsis: N. australis, N. protearum and\nNeopestalotiopsissp.;and Nigrospora: N. sphaerica,\nN.hainanensisandNigrosporasp.Fourof these species have already been\nreported in cactaceae of the genus Opuntia, but only N. batangarum,C.\nfructicola and C. siamenseare reported in the genus Nopalea. All\nisolates were pathogenic to detached cladodes of\nNopaleacochenillifera(var. Miúda). Differences in aggressiveness were\nobserved among the species, with L.iraniensisandF. lunatumcharacterized\nas the most aggressive species, whilst F.verticillioidesas the least\naggressive.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118006","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118006.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118007.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118008.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118004","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118004.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118005","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118005.phy"}]}
