In\nthe course of this study, we have investigated the phylogeny of the Po.\ntridactyla complex with special emphasis on potential aspects of cryptic\nspeciation. The results suggested that Po. tridactyla represents a\nspecies complex consisting of at least twelve different species. Based\non detailed morphological examinations and molecular sequence analyses,\nwe propose to divide Po. tridactyla s. lat. into ten species,\nencompassing seven new species (Po. ampla, Po. pruni-avium, Po.\npruni-cerasoidis, Po. prunigena, Po. pruni-lusitanicae, Po. prunina, Po.\npruni-japonicae) and three known species (Po. longiseta, Po. salatai and\nPo. tridactyla s. str.). Oidium passerinii on Pr. laurocerasus is\nconfirmed as a synonym of Po. tridactyla. Epitypes are designated for\nPo. tridactyla and Oidium passerinii. Detailed morphological\nexaminations of the two Podosphaera taxa on Pr. cerasifera and Pr.\npersica from Australia are still needed to draw final taxonomic\nconclusions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117904.phy"}]}
