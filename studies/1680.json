Two well-supported groups\nwithin Marsilea are identified. Group I includes two subgroups, and is\nrelatively species-poor. Species assignable to this group have glabrous\nleaves (land leaves may have a few hairs), sporocarps lacking both a\nraphe and teeth, and share a preference from submerged conditions (i.e.,\nthey are intolerant of desiccation). Group II is relatively diverse, and\nits members have leaves that are pubescent, sporocarps that bear a raphe\nand from zero to two teeth, and the plants are often emergent at the\nedges of lakes and ponds. Within Group II, five subgroups receive robust\nsupport: three are predominantly African, one is New World, and one Old\nWorld. Phylogenetic assessment of morphological evolution suggests that\nthe presence of an inferior sporocarp tooth and the place of sporocarp\nmaturation are homoplastic characters, and are therefore, of unreliable\ntaxonomic use at an infrageneric level. In contrast, the presence of a\nraphe and superior sporocarp tooth are reliable synapomorphies for\nclassification within Marsilea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marsilea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4688.phy"}]}
