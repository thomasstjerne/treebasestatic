Despite many applications of molecular\nmethods in attempts at resolving the evolutionary relationships among\nthe major clades of turtles, some nodes in the tree have proved to be\nextremely problematic and have remained unresolved. In this study, we\nuse fourteen nuclear loci to provide an in depth look at several of\nthese troublesome nodes and infer the systematic relationships among 11\nof the 14 turtle families. We find strong support for two of the most\nproblematic nodes in the deep phylogeny of turtles that have\ntraditionally defied resolution. In particular, we recover strong\nsupport for a sister relationship between the Emydidae and the monotypic\nbigheaded-turtle, Platysternon megacephalum. We also find strong support\nfor a clade consisting of sea turtles, mud and musk turtles, and\nsnapping turtles. Within this clade, we find strong support for a\nsnapping turtle/mud and musk turtle sister relationship. Our results\nemphasize the utility of multi-locus datasets in phylogenetic analyses\nof difficult problems","trees":[{"tree_label":"P26s4 Gene Tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6445.phy"},{"tree_label":"NB22519 Gene Tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6446.phy"},{"tree_label":"HNFL Gene Tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6447.phy"},{"tree_label":"TB1 Gene Tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6441.phy"},{"tree_label":"AIING Gene Tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6452.phy"},{"tree_label":"HMGB2 Gene Tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6448.phy"},{"tree_label":"ZFHX1B Gene Tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6440.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAX Gene conTree 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6439.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAG Gene Tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6443.phy"},{"tree_label":"AHR genetree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6451.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated Dataset Tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6155.phy"},{"tree_label":"BMP2 Gene Tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6449.phy"},{"tree_label":"TB29 Gene Tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6442.phy"},{"tree_label":"R35 Gene Tree","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6444.phy"},{"tree_label":"BDNF Gene Tree","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6450.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAX Gene conTree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6438.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEST con tree","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Difficult Nodes in the Turtle Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6424.phy"}]}
