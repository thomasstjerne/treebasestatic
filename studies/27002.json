Sequences of\nITS and nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated,\nand phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood,\nmaximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods. The phylogenetic\nanalyses based on molecular data of ITS and ITS+nLSU sequences in\nSteccherinaceae showed that Trulla yunnanensis nested into Trulla and\nthen grouped with T. dentipora and T. duracina. Further phylogeny\ninferred from ITS sequences among Trulla revealed that Trulla\nyunnanensis formed a monophyletic entity with a high support (100% BS,\n100% BP and 1.00 BPP).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinum ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trulla ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trulla ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129690.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinum ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129692.phy"}]}
