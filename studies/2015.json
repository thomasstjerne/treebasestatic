Four major\ngroups of siboglinids are known\u001avestimentiferans, moniliferans, Osedax\nspp., and frenulates. Although endosymbionts of vestimentiferans and\nOsedax spp. have been previously characterized, little is currently\nknown about endosymbiotic bacteria associated with frenulate and\nmoniliferan siboglinids. This is particularly surprising given that\nfrenulates are the most speciated and widely distributed group of\nsiboglinids. Here, we molecularly characterize endosymbiotic bacteria\nassociated with the frenulate siboglinid Siboglinum fiordicum by using\n16S rDNA ribotyping in concert with lasercapture microdissection (LCM).\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that at least three major clades of\nendosymbiotic ??-proteobacteria associate with siboglinid annelids, with\neach clade corresponding to a major siboglinid group. S. fiordicum\nendosymbionts are a group of ??\u001aproteobacteria that are divergent from\nbacteria associated with vestimentiferan or Osedax hosts. Interestingly,\nsymbionts of S. fiordicum, from Norway, are most closely related to\nsymbionts of the frenulate Oligobrachia mashikoi from Japan, suggesting\nthat symbionts of frenulates may share common evolutionary history or\nmetabolic features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Siboglinid Endosymbiont Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5111.phy"}]}
