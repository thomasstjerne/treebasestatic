Within\nTachyeres, the three flightless species appear to be monophyletic, with\nthe two Atlantic species\u001aT. leucocephalus and T. brachypterus\u001abeing\nclosest relatives. This phylogenetic hypothesis mirrors the pattern of\nmorphometric similarities among the four species. Speciation in the\ngenus is explainable by the isolation caused by two major glaciations in\nsouthern South America and related fluctuations in sea level, and\nintervening dispersals. The biogeographic model is compared to a\nmorphometric assessment of populations of T. patachonicus and\nelectrophoretic analyses of the four species of Tachyeres.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tachyeres","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1512.phy"}]}
