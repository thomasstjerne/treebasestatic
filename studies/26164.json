Among them, nine\nspecies, P. burdsallii, P. cinerea, P. hymenochaetoides, P.\nleptocystidiata, P. metuloidea, P. minor, P. sinensis, P. subrosea and\nP. yunnanensis are described and illustrated as new to science.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123264.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123265","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123265.phy"}]}
