This study presents three\nnew species of Cylindrobasidium from East Asia, according to\nmorphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses based on\nsequence data inferred from nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) region and nuc 28S rDNA (28S). Cylindrobasidium\nbifidus grows on dead or living branches of angiosperm (e.g.,\nBroussonetia papyrifera) in SW China, Taiwan and northern Vietnam, and\nis characterized by having effused, cream basidiocarps with smooth\nhymenophore, presence of subicular cystidia with bifurcate apex,\npresence of fusiform hymenial cystidia, and pyriform basidiospores.\nCylindrobasidium macrosporum grows on angiosperm branches in subtropical\nTaiwan, is characterized by having effused, ivory-colored basidiocarps\nwith smooth to tuberculate hymenophore, presence of guttulate, subicular\ncystidia with bifurcate apex, presence of guttulate, cylindrical\nhymenial cystidia with narrow apices, and large, guttulate, fusiform\nbasidiospores. Cylindrobasidium sublaeve grows on angiosperm branches in\nSW China and Taiwan, and is characterized by having effused-reflexed,\ncream or pinkish-buff basidiocarps with smooth hymenophore, presence of\nsubfusiform or cylindrical hymenial cystidia, and pyriform\nbasidiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrobasidium genus using BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128924.phy"}]}
