Based on the superficial resemblance of its\nsporocarps to those of Licea biforis the species was placed within the\norder Liceales which belongs to the bright-spored clade. However,\ndetailed studies on morphology and life cycle revealed some characters\nof the order Physarales. To elucidate the systematic position of K.\nfimicola we obtained three partial and one complete sequence of the SSU\nrDNA. A comparsion with recent myxomycete phylogenies based on SSU\nsequences revealed a clear relationship of K. fimicola to the order\nPhysarales. However, the obtained sequences are not closely related to\nany of the two known families of Physarales, supporting the erection of\na monotypic genus for this species. Along with morphological\nobservations our data allow to exclude K. fimicola from the order\nLiceales and define its place within the dark-spored clade of\nmyxomycetes among the order Physarales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0+","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kelleromyxa fimicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dark spored clade SSU","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kelleromyxa fimicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57814.phy"}]}
