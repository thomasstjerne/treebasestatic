Sternberg in 1936 from the Oldman Formation (Upper Cretaceous)\nof Alberta, Canada, with a brief description focusing on the cranium\nfollowing in 1953. A re-description of the holotype skeleton confirms\nits position as a hadrosaurine dinosaur exhibiting the following unique\ncombination of characters: paddle-like solid nasal crest; posteriorly\nelongated prefrontal; only the anterior tip of the lacrimal contacting\nmaxilla; extremely elongated anterior maxillary process; and a\nquadratojugal with a noncrescentic posterior margin variably forming a\nparaquadratic foramen with the quadrate. Comparison of the holotype with\nother specimens assigned to the taxon reveals numerous morphological\ndifferences. These variable features include the presence/absence of an\naccessory premaxillary foramen, the number of maxillary/ dentary\nvertical tooth rows, the number of functional teeth per tooth row\ncontributing to the dental occlusal surface, the bones forming the\nmandibular glenoid, the presence/absence of a nasal foramen, nasal crest\nmorphology, the number of cervical vertebrae, and axis morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 18","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55558.phy"}]}
