In this study we performed the first\ngenome-wide TF identification and comparison between haptophytes and\nother algal lineages. Results For TF identification and classification,\nwe created a comprehensive pipeline using a combination of BLAST, HMMER\nand InterProScan software. The accuracy evaluation of the pipeline shows\nits applicability for every alga, plant and cyanobacterium, with very\ngood PPV and sensitivity. This pipeline allowed us to identify and\nclassified the transcription factor complement of the three haptophytes\nTisochrysis lutea, Emiliania huxleyi and Pavlova sp.; the two\nstramenopiles Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nannochloropsis gaditana;\nthe chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the rhodophyte\nPorphyridium purpureum. By using T. lutea and Porphyridium purpureum,\nthis work extends the variety of species included in such comparative\nstudies, allowing the detection and detailed study of lineage-specific\nfeatures, such as the presence of TF families specific to the green\nlineage in Porphyridium purpureum, haptophytes and stramenopiles. Our\ncomprehensive pipeline also allowed us to identify fungal and\ncyanobacterial TF families in the algal nuclear genomes. Conclusions\nThis study provides examples illustrating the complex evolutionary\nhistory of algae, some of which support the involvement of a green alga\nin haptophyte and stramenopile evolution","trees":[{"tree_label":"TF families presence/absence in seven algae","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microalgae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95064.phy"}]}
