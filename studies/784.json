The results of the study indicate that\nAngophora and Corymbia form a well-supported clade that is highly\ndifferentiated from Eucalyptus s.s. Corymbia species are divided between\ntwo clades, one of which may be the sister to Angophora. Allosyncarpia,\nArillastrum, Eucalyptopsis and ‘Stockwellia’ are also highly\ndifferentiated from Eucalyptus s.s. If the genus Eucalyptus is to be\nexpanded to include Angophora and Corymbia(sensu Brooker 2000), ITS data\nsuggest that Allosyncarpia, Eucalyptopsis, ‘Stockwellia’ and potentially\nArillastrum should also be included in Eucalyptus s.l. The ITS data\nsuggest that subg. Symphyomyrtus is paraphyletic and that subg.\nMinutifructus should be included within it. Within subg.Symphyomyrtus,\nonly sect. Maidenaria appears to be monophyletic. Sections Adnataria and\nDumaria are probably monophyletic; sections Exsertaria and Latoangulatae\nare very close and probably should be combined in a single section.\nSection Bisectae is polyphyletic and is divided into two distinct\nlineages. The phylogenetic groups depicted by ITS data are consistent\nwith the frequency of natural inter-specific hybridisations as well as\ndata from controlled crosses within subgenus Symphyomyrtus. The ITS data\nillustrate that subg. Idiogenes and western Australian monocalypts are\nearly evolutionary lines relative to E. diversifolia, E. rubiginosa\n(monotypic subg. Primitiva) and the eastern monocalypts and that subg.\nPrimitiva should be sunk into subg. Eucalyptus. Subgenus Eudesmia may be\nmonophyletic, grouping with subgenera Idiogenes and Eucalyptus. Further\nwork is required to confirm the phylogenetic positions of the monotypic\nsubgenera Alveolata, Cruciformes, Acerosae and Cuboidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs. 2 4","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arillastrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3890.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eucalyptus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3887.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eucalyptus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3888.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 1 3","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arillastrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symphyomyrtus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3891.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Symphyomyrtus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3892.phy"}]}
