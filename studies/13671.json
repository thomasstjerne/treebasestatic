The four main\nmorphological characters used to define these genera have been\nconsidered homoplasious and not useful for resolving the complex. This\nstudy re-evaluates character homology and discusses the use of these\ncharacters for defining monophyletic groups recovered from a\nreconstructed phylogeny using four nuclear loci. Generic delimitation of\nsmut fungi based on their hosts is also discussed as a means for\nidentifying genera within this group. Morphological characters and host\nspecificity can be used to circumscribe genera within the\nUstilago-Sporisorium-Macalpinomyces complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS LSU ML","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59092","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59092.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59095.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59096.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS LSU GAPDH EF1a ML","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59089.phy"},{"tree_label":"ILE ML","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59097.phy"}]}
