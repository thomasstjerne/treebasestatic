The phylogenetic\nrelationships revealed clear separation of all 10 North American\nArmillaria species, with the exception of one A. gallica isolate that\nperhaps represents an unnamed cryptic species. These results indicate\nthat the EF-1α gene could potentially serve as a diagnostic tool for\ndistinguishing among currently recognized North American Biological\nSpecies of Armillaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"North American Armillaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46391.phy"}]}
