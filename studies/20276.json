{"Authors":" Jia J.

Species of these genera have not only ecological\nfunctions, but also economic importance. Phylogenetic and taxonomic\nstudies on taxa in these genera are carried out. Inferred from\nphylogenies based on DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) regions and the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU),\nthe sampled 36 species traditionally belong to Physisporinus,\nRigidoporus, Leucophellinus and Oxyporus are nested mostly in six\nlineages. Of these lineages three (including genera Physisporinus,\nCeriporia and Flaviporus) belong to Polyporales and three lineages\n(including genera Rigidoporus, Bridgeoporus and Leucophellinus) belong\nto Hymenochaetales. In addition, samples of R. hypobrunneus are\nscattered in another lineage in Polyporales. Rigidoporus and Oxyporus\nare merged because the type species of both genera are nested in a\nsingle lineage within Hymenochaetales. Some taxa previously addressed in\nOxyporus are transferred to Ceriporia based on current phylogeny.\nCombined the morphological and phylogenetic evidence, 16 new\ncombinations in Bridgeoporus, Ceriporia, Flaviporus, Rigidoporus and\nPhysisporinus are proposed. Five new species, Physisporinus crataegi, P.\nlavendulus, P. subcrocatus, P. tibeticus and Rigidoporus submicroporus,\nare identified from China. Illustrated descriptions of the novel species\nare provided. Three taxa are treated at generic level of Physisporinus\nbecause of limited samples","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
