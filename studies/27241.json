We collected 12 specimens from Honshu and\nAmami-Oshima Island, Japan. The results of morphological observation and\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis, these specimens were identified as four\nspecies in four genera of Octospora lineage (Neottiella albocincta,\nOctospora ithacaensis, Octosporopsis erinacea and Leucoscypha\nleucotricha). Neottiella albocincta, O. ithacaensis and O. erinacea are\nbryophilous Pezizales of Octospora lineage. Leucoscypha leucotricha is\nnon-bryophilous Pezizales of Octospora lineage. These are the first\nreports in Japan at the genus level. This study reveals that bryophilous\nor non-bryophilous Pezizales of Octospora lineage are also present in\nJapan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127200","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127200.phy"}]}
