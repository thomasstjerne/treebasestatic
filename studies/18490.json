Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS)\nof the three species were sequenced and analyzed. In addition, nuclear\nribosomal large subunit (nLSU) gene of Lactifluus indicus was sequenced\nand used in BLASTn search to find similar sequences. Maximum likelihood\n(ML) analysis based on the ITS sequences confirmed both the novelty of\nthese species and their placement within their respective genera. The\ndiscovery of Lactifluus umbonatus and Lacti. indicus represent the first\nreport of novel species belonging to subgenus Gerardii from India.\nLactifluus indicus represents the second record of a pleurotoid\nLactifluus species from India.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lacatarius and Lactifluus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97448.phy"}]}
