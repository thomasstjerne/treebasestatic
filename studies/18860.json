Field symptoms were conspicuous chocolate brown to black\nspots in turf of both species on golf course putting greens and\nfairways. Leaves of plants within these spots exhibited prominent, black\neyespot lesions from which a darkly pigmented fungus was consistently\nisolated. The fungus produced gray- to black-olivaceous mycelium within\nten days on potato dextrose agar at 25 C, but never produced conidia\ndespite numerous attempts to induce them. Field symptoms were reproduced\nin inoculated plants of both grasses, and reisolation of the pathogen\nfrom symptomatic tissues confirmed its pathogenicity by fulfillment of\nKochÂ’s postulates. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequence\nmarkers of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (GPD), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF).\nThe concatenated phylogenetic tree showed strong support for a new\nspecies within Curvularia that is distinctly divergent from other\nCurvularia spp. Therefore, the proposed name of the darkly pigmented\npathogen of warm-season turfgrasses is C. malinah sp. nov. as described\nand illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93750.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93753.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93756","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93756.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93758.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93751.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93757","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93757.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93754.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93760","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93760.phy"}]}
