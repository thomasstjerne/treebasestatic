Some workers recover pterosaurs close to dinosaurs.\nOthers recover silesaurids. Still others recover lagerpetids, or all\nthree. False assumptions and taxon exclusion have been long-standing\nproblems. No workers have experimented with a wider gamut of included\ntaxa. No workers have checked their results to make sure a gradual\naccumulation of traits could be traced for all derived taxa. Here a wide\ngamut (1138 taxa) phylogenetic analysis of the Reptilia and their\nancestors provides a set of genus- to specimen-based out-group taxa for\nall included derived taxa, including the Dinosauria. Every current\ncandidate is tested here (and more than a thousand others). When given\nthis unprecedented opportunity pterosaurs nest with lepidosaurs,\nsilesaurids nest with poposaurs and Lagerpeton nests with Tropidosuchus,\nfar from dinosaurs. Here the clade Crocodylomorpha nests with the\nDinosauria, along with a long list of ancestral taxa extending back to\nthe Late Devonian. As a series these document a gradual accumulation of\nderived traits, from the origin of the cleidoic egg and the first\nappearance of the diapsid skull to bipedal locomotion and a suite of\nfeatures found only in basal dinosaurs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"315","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109420","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109420.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"316","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109421","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109421.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"316","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109422","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109422.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"323","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109423","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109423.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"338","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109424","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109424.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"340","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109425","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109425.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"352","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109426","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109426.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"365","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109427","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109427.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"369","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109428","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109428.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"370","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109429.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"1138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109430","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109430.phy"}]}
