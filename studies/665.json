The description, based on a\nmonoxenic culture established in association with a Ri T-DNA transformed\ncarrot root, combines sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) rDNA, spore\nsterols and fatty acid profiles with more classical taxonomic tools such\nas optical and electron microscopy. The fungus forms clusters containing\nhundreds of small, hyaline, four-layered spores. The necessity to use\ndifferent tools for identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"unpublished tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S sequence comparison of glomales species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3661.phy"}]}
