It resembles some\ngenera of the tribe Thelypodieae, such as Chilocardamum and Weberbauera,\nbut differs mainly by having a well-developed woody caudex with reduced\nleafless stems, rosulate, awl-shaped or linear, sessile, parallel-veined\nbasal leaves conspicuously ciliate with simple trichomes, racemes much\nshorter than the basal leaves, torulose fruits, and mucilaginous seeds.\nPhylogenetic analyses, based on DNA sequences of nuclear ITS and plastid\nndhF and trnL-F regions, place this species in the tribe Thelypodieae,\nwhere it is related to species of Weberbauera, Englerocharis, and\nParodiodoxa. However, it is morphologically different from species of\nall four genera by the character combination above.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS_ML_tree","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64420.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF_ML_tree","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64421.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF_ML_tree","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thelypodieae ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64422.phy"}]}
