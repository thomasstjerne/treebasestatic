We designed degenerate primers from\nhomologous sequences in related species to amplify part of the C. apii,\nC. apiicola, C. beticola, C. zeae-maydis and C. zeina mating type genes.\nChromosome walking was used to determine the full length mating type\ngenes of these species. Primers were developed to amplify and sequence\nhomologous portions of the mating type genes of additional species.\nPhylogenetic analyses of these sequences revealed little variation among\nmembers of the C. apii complex, whereas C. zeae-maydis and C. zeina were\nfound to be dissimilar. The presence of both mating types in\napproximately even proportions in C. beticola, C. zeae-maydis and C.\nzeina populations, in contrast to single mating types in C. apii (MAT1)\nand C. apiicola (MAT2), suggests that a sexual cycle may be active in\nsome of these species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptic Sex in Cercospora spp., 1 of 5 MP trees from\nMAT1-1 sequence data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2564.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptic Sex in Cercospora spp., 1 of 3 MP trees from\nMAT1-2 sequence data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2565.phy"}]}
