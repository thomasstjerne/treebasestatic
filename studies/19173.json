Although blindeyes is widespread throughout Europe and\nAmerica, it grows as an important weed in the west of Iran. Cultural and\nmicroscopic characterization of 62 fungal isolates which were isolated\nfrom lesions of Blindeyes, revealed that 41 were of Ascochyta pisi, 10\nwere of Neodidymelliopsis papaveris as a new species, and 11 isolates\nwere of Allophoma zantedeschiae. Moreover, we accomplished morphological\ncharacters of our strains through phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences\nin five different genes employing internal transcribed spacers and 5.8S\nof the nrDNA (ITS), part of the Î²-tubulin (TUB2), partial LSU rDNA,\nchitin synthase 1(CHS), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF).\nWe showed that two species of As. pisi and Neodidymelliopsis papaveris\nwhich so far identified morphologically as Ascochyta spp, not only are\nnot clustered phylogenetically in one monophyletic clade but also\nseparated in EF1a and CHS genes. For the period of our study\n(2009-2015), we found that Ascochyta pisi is more common than two other\nfungal species which were isolated from blindeyes in diverse locations\nin the west part of Iran. The information of our new variable pathogenic\nspecies may provide new insight into how use them as mycoherbicides on\nthis herbaceous plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"B
