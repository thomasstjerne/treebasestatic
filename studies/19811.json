During the years of 2014Â–2015, we carried out an exploration of\nmycobiota in two unnamed karst caves in Guizhou province, China, and\nobtained 563 fungal strains by dilution plate method. Preliminary ITS\nanalyses of these strains suggested that they belonged to 246 species in\n114 genera, while 23.5% were not identified at the species level. Among\nthese species, 85.8% (211 species) belonged to Ascomycota; 7.3% (18\nspecies) belonged to Basidiomycota; 6.9% (17 species) belonged to\nMucoromycotinaZygomycetes . The majority of these species have been\npreviously known from other environments, mostly from plants or animals\nas pathogens, endophytes or mycorrhizas. We also found that 59.0% of\nthese species were discovered for the first time from karst caves,\nincluding 20 new species that are described in this paper. We conclude\nthat karst caves encompass a high fungal diversity, including a number\nof previously unknown species.
