In the phylogram based on rDNA region\nsequences, a clade of the American fungi was sister to an inclusive\nclade of three autoecious species on Meliosma and a heteroecious species\nhost-alternating between Meliosma and Parthenocissus. An invasive\nBrazilian GLR fungus (as P. meliosmae-myrianthae) was included in the\nAsian-Australasian GLR fungi clade, or the clade of the Thai population\nof Phakopsora sp. It could be assumed that the Brazilian GLR fungus\noriginated from an inadvertently introduced Thai population.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phakopsora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105655.phy"}]}
