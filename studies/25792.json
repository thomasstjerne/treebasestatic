The new species is\ncharacterized by perennial, resupinate to effused-reflexed, woody hard\nand dark gray to almost black basidiocarps, lacerate dissepiments, a\nmonomitic hyphal system, the presence of cystidioles and hyphal pegs,\nand broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (45.1 × 3.14.3 µm). Molecular\nanalysis based on ITS sequences demonstrates the phylogenetic position\nof the new species in Nigrofomes. The discriminating characteristics\nbetween the new species and closely related species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nigrofomes MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122975.phy"}]}
