In this study, a\nsaprobic species was collected from decaying grass in China.\nMaximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses of\ncombined ITS, LSU, SSU, TEF-Î± and RPB2 sequence data clarified the\nphylogenetic affinity in Sparticola. The isolate was confirmed as a new\nspecies based on morphological and phylogenetic analyses. Sparticola\nmuriformis sp. nov. is distinguished from other taxa in Sporormiaceae by\nhaving muriform ascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102903.phy"}]}
