In plastid-bearing organisms,\ntwo pathways may be present for de novo isoprenoid synthesis, the\ncytosolic mevalonate pathway (MVA) and nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted\nnon-mevalonate pathway (DOXP). Using transcriptomic data we find that\ndinoflagellates apparently make exclusive use of the DOXP pathway. Using\nphylogenetic analyses of all DOXP genes we inferred the evolutionary\norigins of DOXP genes in dinoflagellates. Plastid replacements led to a\nDOXP pathway of multiple evolutionary origins. Dinoflagellates commonly\nreferred to as dinotoms due to their relatively recent acquisition of a\ndiatom plastid, express two completely redundant DOXP pathways.\nDinoflagellates with a tertiary plastid of haptophyte origin, by\ncontrast, express a hybrid pathway of dual evolutionary origin. Here,\nchanges in the targeting motif of signal/transit peptide likely allow\nfor targeting the new plastid by the proteins of core isoprenoid\nmetabolism proteins. Parasitic dinoflagellates of the Amoebophyra\nspecies complex appear to have lost the DOXP pathway, suggesting that\nthey may rely on their host for sterol synthesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported
