Xiangornis shenmi has several enantiornithine features,\nincluding a furcula with a significantly elongated hypocleidium, a\ncoracoid with a convex lateral margin, and a minor metacarpal that\nextends further distally than the major metacarpal. However, it also\npossesses some derived ornithurine features, such as a short alular\nmetacarpal (about one-sixth as long as the major metacarpal) that is\ncompletely fused to the majormetacarpal, a large extensor process on the\nalularmetacarpal, proximal and distal fusion between the minor and major\nmetacarpals, and an inter metacarpal space positioned significantly\ndistal to the alular metacarpal. This new find indicates that a\ncarpometacarpal morphology similar to that seen in modern birds probably\nevolved independently in enantiornithines and appeared earlier than in\nOrnithuromorpha, and demonstrates that character evolution in early\nbirds was more complex than previously believed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55113.phy"}]}
