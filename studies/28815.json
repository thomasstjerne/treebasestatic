This study provides the most\ncomprehensive phylogenies of Spyridium to date, analysing both entire\nchloroplast genomes and the nuclear ribosomal array (18S5.8S26S).\nAnalyses support the monophyly of Spyridium, identifying an early\neast-west split at the base of the nuclear phylogeny and deep\ndivergences of New South Wales and Tasmanian endemic clades. We also\nfound evidence of more recent dispersal events between east and west\nAustralia and between Tasmanian and the mainland. Eleven taxa were found\nto be monophyletic in the nrDNA phylogeny and two were clearly\npolyphyletic (S. eriocephalum Fenzl and S. phylicoides Reissek). While\nthe polyphyly of S. eriocephalum correlates with the two varieties,\nsuggesting distinct taxa, further research is required on S.\nphylicoides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 majrule","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133790","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133790.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML consensus","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133791.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 majrule","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133788.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML consesnsus","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133789.phy"}]}
