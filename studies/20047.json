Both\nMaximum Parsimony and Bayesian methods were used to construct the\nphylogenetic trees based on ITS (internal transcribed spacers)\nsequences. Independent status of each proposed new species is based on\nmorphological study, further confirmed by ITS-based phylogenetic\nanalysis. The recently presented Hyphodontia dimitica is found to be\nconspecific with H. nongravis, based on morphological and molecular\nevidences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106648.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106647","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106647.phy"}]}
