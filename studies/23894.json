Within this\ngroup, evolution of the body plan from flattened to spheroidal colonies\nis thought to have occurred independently in two different lineages,\nVolvocaceae and Astrephomene. Volvocacean species undergo inversion to\nform a spheroidal cell layer following successive cell divisions during\nembryogenesis. During inversion, the daughter protoplasts change their\nshape and develop acute chloroplast ends (opposite to basal bodies). By\ncontrast, Astrephomene does not undergo inversion; rather, its daughter\nprotoplasts rotate during successive cell divisions to form a spheroidal\ncolony. However, the evolutionary pathways of these cellular events\ninvolved in the two tactics for formation of spheroidal colony are\nunclear, since the embryogenesis of extant volvocine genera with\nancestral flattened colonies, such as Gonium and Tetrabaena, has not\npreviously been investigated in detail.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Goniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115645.phy"}]}
