The most\nobvious disease symptoms are severe wilting, leaf yellowing, and\nnecrosis of roots and stem tissue close to the soil level. The objective\nof this article is to identify the causal agent of tobacco yellow stunt.\nFifty six isolates were obtained from samples collected from stems and\nroots of diseased tobacco plants and characterized at species level by\nthe analysis of the morphological data and the sequence of rDNA Internal\nTranscribed Spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2). Mycelia of the\nisolates were inoculated in pots with tobacco plants in a greenhouse.\nForty days after inoculation, plants were evaluated for the presence of\nleaf and root symptoms. Although most of the isolates of different\nspecies have caused wilting and root necrosis, only plants inoculated\nwith isolates from Pythium dissotocum have shown yellowing and stunting\nsymptoms like those observed in the diseased plants from the field.\nReisolated mycelium from roots inoculated with P. dissotocum has\nproduced the same reproductive structures in culture media as the field\ncollected isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Pythium Tree","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr21544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21544.phy"}]}
