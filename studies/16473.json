In flowering plants, the short interfering\n(si)RNAs that direct transcriptional silencing are abundant and\nsubfunctionalization has led to specialized machinery responsible for\nsynthesis and action of these small RNAs. In particular, plants possess\nPol IV and Pol V, multi-subunit homologs of the canonical DNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase II, as well as members of the RDR, DCL, and AGO families.\nTogether these enzymes are required for production and activity of Pol\nIV-dependent (p4-)siRNAs, which trigger RNA-directed DNA methylation\n(RdDM) at homologous sequences. P4-siRNAs accumulate highly in\ndeveloping endosperm, a specialized tissue found only in flowering\nplants, and are rare in non-flowering plants, suggesting that the\nevolution of flowers might coincide with the emergence of specialized\nRdDM machinery. Through comprehensive identification of RdDM genes from\nspecies representing the breadth of the land plant phylogeny we describe\nthe ancient origin of Pol IV and Pol V, suggesting a nearly complete and\nfunctional RdDM pathway existed in the earliest land plants. We also\nuncover innovations in these enzymes that are coincident with the\nemergence of seed plants and flowering plants and recent duplications\nthat might indicate additional subfunctionalization. Phylogenetic\nanalysis uncovered rapid evolution of Pol IV and Pol V subunits relative\nto their Pol II counterparts and suggests subfunctionalization arose\nthrough Escape from Adaptive Conflict. Evolution within the\ncarboxy-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit is particularly\nstriking, where illegitimate recombination has driven sequence\ndivergence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NRPX4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78406","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78406.phy"},{"tree_label":"RdDP","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78411","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78411.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRPX2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78405","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78405.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRPX5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78407","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78407.phy"},{"tree_label":"DCL","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78408","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78408.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRPX7","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78409","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78409.phy"},{"tree_label":"AGO","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78410","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78410.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRPX1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78412","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78412.phy"}]}
