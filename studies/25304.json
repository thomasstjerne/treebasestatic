However,\nthe molecular genetic basis of maize stalk strength remains unclear, and\nimprovement methods remain inefficient. Here, we combined map-based\ncloning and association mapping and identified the gene stiff1\nunderlying a major quantitative trait locus for stalk strength in maize.\nA 27.2-kb transposable element insertion was present in the promoter of\nthe stiff1 gene, which encodes an F-box domain protein. This\ntransposable element insertion repressed the transcription of stiff1,\nleading to the increased cellulose and lignin contents in the cell wall\nand consequently greater stalk strength. Furthermore, a precisely edited\nallele of stiff1 generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system resulted in\nplants with a stronger stalk than the unedited control. Nucleotide\ndiversity analysis revealed that the promoter of stiff1 was under strong\nselection in the maize stiff-stalk group. Our cloning of stiff1 reveals\na case in which a transposable element played an important role in maize\nimprovement. The identification of stiff1 and our edited stiff1 allele\npave the way for efficient improvement of maize stalk strength.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zea mays stiff1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121629.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zea mays stiff1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121630.phy"}]}
