Marine\nornamental fish identification at field level is very difficult because\nof their high diversity and profound changes in appearance during their\ndevelopment stages and camouflage. To facilitate ornamental fish trading\nwith ease and in compliance with the biodiversity act, the DNA barcoding\ntechnique could be used to accurately identify species. In this study,\nDNA barcodes were generated for 31 species of commercially important\nmarine ornamental fishes from India. The average genetic distance (K2P\nmodel) within species, genus and family was 0.446, 13.08 and 20.09%,\nrespectively. Intraspecific variation has increased several folds (15-20\ntimes) after including conspecific sequences from different geographical\nlocations. Presence of allopatric lineages / cryptic species was\nobserved in Indo-pacific region. The NJ tree constructed based on K2P\nvalues showed distinct clusters shared by congeneric species specific to\npopulations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heniochonus acuminatus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77801.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epinephelus coeruleopunctatus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77804.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plotosus linea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77802.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bathygobius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77805.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalopholis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77803.phy"}]}
