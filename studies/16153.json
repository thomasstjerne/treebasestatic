This study evaluates 11 JapaneseãPhytophthora strains\nthat previously had been identified morphologically, and three\nadditional strains that had remained unidentified. The eleven previously\nidentified strains exhibited low sequence homology with the species they\nwere assigned to originally, but high homology with P. hedraiandra, P.\nmultivora, P. niederhauserii, P. sansomeana, P. sp. kelmania, and P.\nsojae. The three previously unidentified strains showed low homology\nwith representative strains of P. nicotianae or P. palmivora, according\nto previous analyses based on rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer\n(rRNA gene ITS), rRNA gene large sub-unit (LSU) and cytochrome c\nsub-oxidase (cox)1 sequences. To confirm previous phylogenetic\nidentifications, we sequenced more two genes, Î²-tubulin and translation\nelongation factor 1 alpha (EF1-Î±), performed phylogenetic analysis in\ndifferent gene combinations and obtained results that were in line with\nmorphological data. The re-identified species P. hedraiandra, P.\nmultivora, P. niederhauserii, P. sansomeana, and P. sp. kelmania are new\nto Japan, adding to the Phytophthora biodiversity in this country. Taken\ntogether, this and previous phylogenetic studies indicate that cox1 is a\ndependable gene for Phytophthora identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora MP BS Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77463.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 211","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora MP Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77462.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora 5 gene MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79955.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 155","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora COX1 MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79956.phy"}]}
