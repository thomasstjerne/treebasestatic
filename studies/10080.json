Species\ndelimitation and reconstruction of evolutionary relationships within\nTrachyphytum have been difficult due to restricted and continuous\nmorphological variation. We employed phylogeny reconstructions based on\nmorphology and DNA sequences from the plastid trnH-psbA, trnS-trnG,\ntrnS-trnfM, ndhF-rpl32, and rpl32-trnL regions and the low-copy nuclear\ngene idh to investigate evolutionary relationships and patterns of\nhybridization and homoplasy among diploid species in Trachyphytum.\nReconstructions indicated surprisingly high levels of genetic\nintrogression among closely and distantly related diploids.\nAdditionally, reconstructions based on molecular data showed that some\nmorphological characters traditionally used to delineate groups exhibit\nhomoplasy. However, both molecular and morphologically based\nreconstructions supported two major clades in section Trachyphytum\ncorresponding to the subsection Trachyphyta and a subsection Affines\nsensu lato comprising taxa previously separated into subsections Affines\nand Micranthae. Further, this study strengthens assertions that\ncharacters apparently shared between the two annual sections of\nMentzelia, Trachyphytum and Bicuspidaria, represent homoplasious\nevolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentzelia section Trachyphyutm diploid morphological\ndata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6397.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentzelia section Trachyphyutm diploid plastid\ndata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6364.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentzelia section Trachyphyutm diploid idh data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6377.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentzelia section Trachyphyutm diploid combined\nmolecular data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6249.phy"}]}
