{"Authors":" Li-Wei Zhou","Year":" 2015","Title":" Taxonomy and phylogeny of Phellinidium (Hymenochaetales,\nBasidiomycota): a redefinition and the segregation of Coniferiporia gen.\nnov. for forest pathogens","Journal":" PLOS ONE","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" Phellinidium, which includes 13 accepted polypore species\nmostly with resupinate basidiocarps, is one of the most aggressive\nforest pathogenic genera. This genus is characterized by the combination\nof a monomitic hyphal structure, abundant hyphoid setae in the context\nand trama, and hyaline and thin-walled basidiospores. Previously,\nnuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA-based phylogenetic analyses\nrecovered Phellinidium into three clades within Hymenochaetaceae. To\nexplore the relationships between the species of Phellinidium,\nespecially those between forest pathogens and saprophytes, we examined\nspecimens of this genus from Asia, Europe and America from a\nmorphological and phylogenetic perspective. A new genus, Coniferiporia,\nwas found to segregate from Phellinidium for three aggressive forest\npathogens, and three new combinations, viz. C. qilianensis (the generic\ntype), C. weirii and C. sulphurascens, were proposed. Phellinidium\ncryptocystidiatum was treated as a synonym of Coniferiporia\nsulphurascens. The circumscription of Phellinidium was delimited to\naccommodate P. asiaticum, P. ferrugineofuscum (the generic type), P.\nfragrans and P. pouzarii. Accordingly, the concept of Phellinidium was\nemended. No species of Phellinidium under the new circumscription have\nbeen reported to be forest pathogens. Phellinidium noxium and P.\nrufitinctum were excluded from Phellinidium, while the taxonomical\npositions of Phellinidium aciferum, P. lamaÃ«nse and P. orientale are\nstill uncertain. Keys to Coniferiporia and Phellinidium, the three\nspecies of Coniferiporia, and the four accepted species of Phellinidium\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91950","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91950.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91951","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91951.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91953","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91953.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91952","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91952.phy"}]}
