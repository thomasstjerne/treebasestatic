Herein we utilize a large, longitudinal dataset of snail\nfirst intermediate host infection data from lakes in Alberta, Canada to\ninfer trematode larval diversity using molecular phylogenetics and snail\nhost associations. From our assessments, we uncover a diversity of\nseventy-nine larval trematode species among just five snail host\nspecies. Only fourteen species were identified to a previously described\nspecies, while the other sixty-five species are either cryptic or\notherwise unrepresented by mitochondrial genes in GenBank. This study\ncurrently represents the largest and most diverse singular molecular\nsurvey of trematode larval fauna composed of over one thousand\nmitochondrial sequences. Surprisingly, rarefaction analyses indicate we\nhave yet to capture the complete diversity of trematodes from our\nsampling area.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootstrap
