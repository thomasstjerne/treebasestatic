This has long been thought to be related to\nthe predominantly or seasonally dry climate. The present study posits\nthat if aridity were a key factor in the evolution of sequestrate\nfruit-bodies, most sequestrate species would have emerged in Australia\nonly after it began to aridify, which occurred post-separation with\nAntarctica (c. 32 million years ago). Focusing on the high phylogenetic\ndiversity of sequestrate taxa in the Agaricomycetes in Australia, dates\nof sequestrate nodes were compiled directly from published phylogenies\n(four lineages) or created using sequences available on GenBank that\nwere processed in BEAST using a secondary calibration method (nine\nlineages). Although the morphologically diverse Hysterangiales was found\nto be the first group to become sequestrate, c. 83 million years ago,\noverall sequestration in Australia occurred more recently. Models were\ncreated and compared and support was found for an increased rate of\nsequestration in Australia at some point between 34 and 13 million years\nago (during the Oligocene and Miocene). Although the rate of\nsequestration is shown to have increased in Australia after separation\nfrom Antarctica, the timing also overlaps with the radiation of\npotential mycorrhizal plant associates, and the emergence of specialised\nmycophagous marsupials. Although aridification is evidently not the sole\ndriver of sequestration, it is still likely to have had a major\ninfluence on the diversity of sequestrate fungi in Australia.\nComparisons with other regions of high sequestrate diversity will be\ninformative.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91726","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91726.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91727","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91727.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91728","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91728.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91729","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91729.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91725","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91725.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91730","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91730.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91731","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91731.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91732","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91732.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91724","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91724.phy"}]}
