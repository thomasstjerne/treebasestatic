The monophyly\nof Tidestromia is well supported by four synapomorphies: alternate\nleaves, dichasial inflorescences, and pollen that is psilate\n(homoplasious) and with mesoporia that are narrowed distally. The single\nmost parsimonious tree resolved T. valdesiana as sister to the rest of\nTidestromia, which is apomorphically diagnosed by the presence of\ninvolucres. The annual habit supports a clade comprising T. carnosa, T.\nlanuginosa, and T. tenella , which is nested among the species with\ninvolucres. The phylogenetic relationships of the rest of the taxa\nremain unresolved. Traditional morphological evidence thus is important\nfor circumscribing the genus Tidestromia, but shows limited utility for\nresolving species groups within this genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amaranthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_714.phy"}]}
