In this work,\nwe performed molecular and morphological analyses of samples of Homonota\nfrom the central region of northern Paraguay, comparing the data with\nthose of related species of the group: H. horrida and H.\nseptentrionalis. We found strong molecular evidence (based on the mtDNA\ngene Cyt-b) to distinguish this lineage as a new species. Morphological\nstatistical analysis showed that females of the three species are\ndifferent in metric characters (SVL and TL as the most contributing\nvariables), whereas males are less differentiated. No robust differences\nwere found in meristic characters. The most remarkable trait for the\ndiagnosis of the new species is the presence of well-developed keeled\ntubercles on the sides of the neck, and lack of a white band\n(crescent-shaped) in the occipital area, which is present in H. horrida\nand H. septentrionalis. Nevertheless, in our sample, we found three\nspecimens (one juvenile and two young adults) that exhibit the white\noccipital band. Thus, this character seems only reliable in adults of\nthe new species. The new species is parapatric to H. septentrionalis,\nboth inhabiting the Dry Chaco of Paraguay.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110203","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110203.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110201.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110202","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110202.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110204","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110204.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110206","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110206.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110205","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110205.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110207","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110207.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110208","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110208.phy"}]}
