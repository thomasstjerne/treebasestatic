Among them B. bisporus and B. pallidus are described as\nnew in the paper. Comprehensive descriptions of all species,\nillustrations, photographs and comparisons with similar taxa are\nprovided. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted to aid of taxa\ndelimitation as well as identification of species boundaries in the\ngenus Bolbitius. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions inferred from\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were based on combined\ndatasets: nrITS-nrLSU for the whole set of studied species and\nnrITS-tef1-mtSSU for B. titubans specimens. The molecular data of three\ngenetic markers indicate the existence at least three divergent lineages\nin the B. titubans, each may represent a phylogenetic species or\nindependent taxonomic unit. This suggests that B. titubans likely is a\nspecies complex rather than one widely distributed taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bolbitius comb ITS TEF mtSSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bolbitius ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87467.phy"}]}
