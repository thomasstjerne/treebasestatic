Laetiporus ailaoshanensis is characterized by\norange-yellow to reddish orange pileal surface and cream to buff pores\nwhen fresh, azonate to faintly zonate pileus, ovoid to ellipsoid\nbasidiospores (5.06.2 3 4.05.0 mm), and it has been observed only on\nLithocarpus. Laetiporus zonatus is characterized by white to cream\npileal surface with buff to clay-buff base when fresh, concentrically\nzonate basidiocarps, ellipsoid to pyriform or drop- shaped basidiospores\n(5.87.2 3 4.35.5 mm), and it has been found only on Quercus. The\nphylogenetic relationships of all recognized Laetiporus species were\ninferred from a combined dataset of ITS and nLSU- rDNA sequences, and L.\nailaoshanensis and L. zonatus represent two new lineages in this\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laetiporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94793.phy"}]}
