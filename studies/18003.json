Recent increases in the severity and\ninci- dence of the disease have prompted a re-evaluation of the\npathogen, originally described as Microsphaeropsis tanaceti, including\nits phylogenetic relationships and morphology. Nucleotide comparison of\npartial sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer,\nb-tubulin, large subunit 28S nrDNA (LSU), actin and\nglyceraldehyde-3-phos- phate dehydrogenase loci identified two distinct\nhaplotypes within the species. Haplotype differentiation was consistent\nfor each locus, except for the LSU, within which sequences were\nidentical across all isolates. Morphological variation, especially\nculture pigmentation and conidial size, consistently supported the\nphylogenetic data distinguishing two hap- lotypes. Phylogenetic\ncomparisons of M. tanaceti incorporating 98 Didymellaceae species did\nnot associate the M. tanaceti haplotypes with the genus\nMicrosphaeropsis. The two M. tanaceti haplotypes were closely related,\nand clustered in the Didymella sensu stricto clade. Based on these\nphylogenetic results, supported by their distinct morphol- ogy and\ncultural characteristics, the two haplotypes of M. tanaceti are\nreclassified as two species of Didymella, namely D. rosea and D.\ntanaceti. The implications of two closely related species causing tan\nspot of pyrethrum are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"3_gene_100_specie_Bayesian_Tree","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymella species complex 3 gene 100 species\nBayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89254.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED4_gene_36_specie_Bayesian_tree","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymella species complex 4 gene 36 species\nBayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89315.phy"},{"tree_label":"3_gene_100_specie_Max_Parsimony_PAUP_Matrix","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymella species complex 3 gene 100 species Max\nParsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89255.phy"},{"tree_label":"4_gene_36_specie_Max_Parsimony_tree","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymella species complex 4 gene 36 species Max\nParsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89256.phy"}]}
