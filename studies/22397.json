Recent\nefforts to genetically characterize genus Botrytis have revealed new\nspecies on diverse host crops around the world. In this study, surveys\nand subsequent genetic analysis of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosate\ndehydrogenase (G3PDH), heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), DNA-dependent RNA\npolymerase subunit II (RPB2), and necrosis and ethylene-inducing\nproteins 1 and 2 (NEP1 and NEP2) genes indicated that Botrytis isolates\ncollected from peony fields in the United States contained more species\ndiversity than ever before reported on a single host, including up to 10\npotentially novel species. Together, up to 16 different phylogenetic\nspecies were found in association with peonies in the Pacific Northwest,\nwhich is over a third of the total number of species that are currently\nnamed. Furthermore, species were found on peonies in Alaska that have\nbeen described on other host plants in different parts of the world,\nindicating a wider geographic and host distribution than previously\nthought. Lastly, some isolates found on peony share sequence similarity\nwith unnamed species found living as endophytes in weedy hosts,\nsuggesting that the isolates found on peony have flexible lifestyles as\nrecently discovered in the genus. Selected pathogenicity, growth, and\nmorphological characteristics of the putatively new Botrytis species\nwere also assessed to provide a basis for future formal description of\nthe isolates as new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis 5 Genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115697.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"214","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis G3PDHall","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110518.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115700","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115699.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115698","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115698.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis G3PDH HSP60","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116871.phy"}]}
