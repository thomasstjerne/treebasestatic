Here, we reconstructed the phylogeny and\nidentified repeats in the genome of 26 Drosophila exhibiting a two-fold\nvariation in genome size de novo. The content in transposable elements\nis highly correlated to genome size evolution among these closely\nrelated species. We detected a strong phylogenetic signal on the\nevolution of both genome size and TE content, and a genome contraction\nin D. melanogaster subgroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drosophila coI for 26 flies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96006.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97270.phy"}]}
