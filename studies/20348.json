{"Authors":" Nan Song","Year":" 2018","Title":" Insight into Higher-Level Phylogeny of Neuropterida: Evidence\nfrom Secondary Structures of Mitochondrial rRNA Genes and Mitogenomic\nData","Journal":" PLOS ONE","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Neuropterida; phylogeny; rRNA secondary structure;\nmitogenome; high-throughput pooled sequencing","DOI":"","Abstract":" It is well known that the rRNA structure information is\nimportant to assist phylogenetic analysis through identifying homologous\npositions to improve alignment accuracy. In addition, the secondary\nstructure of some conserved motifs is highly stable among distantly\nrelated taxa, which can provide potentially informative characters for\nestimating phylogeny. In this paper, we applied the high-throughput\npooled sequencing approach to the determination of neuropteran\nmitogenomes. Four complete mitogenome sequences were obtained: Micromus\nangulatus (Hemerobiidae), Chrysoperla nipponensis (Chrysopidae), Rapisma\nsp. (Ithonidae), and Thaumatosmylus sp. (Osmylidae). This allowed us to\nsample more complete mitochondrial RNA gene sequences. Secondary\nstructure diagrams for the complete mitochondrial small and large\nribosomal subunit RNA genes of eleven neuropterid species were\npredicted. Comparative analysis of the secondary structures indicated a\ncloser relationship of Megaloptera and Neuroptera. This result was\ncongruent with the resulting phylogeny inferred from sequence alignments\nof all 37 mitochondrial genes, namely the hypothesis of (Raphidioptera +\n(Megaloptera + Neuroptera)).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Trees","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101078.phy"},{"tree_label":"35taxa
