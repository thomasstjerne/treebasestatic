Some of the brown-rot fungi also have\nimportant economic value as medicinal or edible mushrooms. Recent\nstudies showed that the ability to produce brown rot has evolved\nindependently at least five times. In the current study, the\nclassification system of the largest clade of brown-rot fungi in the\nPolyporales, i.e. the antrodia clade, is revised. Furthermore, the\nphylogenetic relationships of all brown-rot fungi within the Polyporales\nare analysed based on DNA sequences of multiple loci including the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, the large subunit nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene\n(nSSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene sequences (mtSSU), the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1), the RNA polymerase II\nlargest subunit (RPB1) and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II\n(RPB2). The comprehensive study showed that species of the antrodia\nclade formed fourteen lineages, which are assigned at family level,\nincluding four new families: Auriporiaceae, Piptoporellaceae,\nPostiaceae, Taiwanofungaceae, and ten existing families:\nAdustoporiaceae, Dacryobolaceae, Fibroporiaceae, Fomitopsidaceae,\nLaetiporaceae, Laricifomitaceae, Phaeolaceae, Pycnoporellaceae,\nSarcoporiaceae, and Sparassidaceae. In addition, two new lineages\ncontaining white-rot fungi outside of the antrodia clade but within the\nPolyporales are recognized and proposed as new families, viz.,\nClimacocystaceae and Gloeoporellaceae. This brings the number of\nlineages recognized at family level for all known taxa of Polyporales to\n31. Meanwhile, eleven new genera, viz., Austroporia, Aurantipostia,\nAustropostia, Daedalella, Nothofagiporus, Pseudoantrodia,\nPseudofomitopsis, Rhodoantrodia, Tenuipostia, Wolfiporiella and\nWolfiporiopsis are proposed; eighteen new species, viz., Amyloporia\nnivea, Antrodia subheteromorpha, Aurantipostia macrospora, Austropostia\nhirsuta, A. plumbea, A. subpunctata, Cystidiopostia subhibernica,\nDaedalella micropora, Fuscopostia subfragilis, Lentoporia subcarbonica,\nMelanoporia tropica, Neolentiporus tropicus, Phaeolus fragilis, Postia\ncrassicontexta, Pseudoantrodia monomitica, Pseudofomitopsis microcarpa,\nResinoporia luteola and Rhodonia subrancida are described; and thirteen\nnew combinations, viz., Austroporia stratosa, Austropostia brunnea, A.\npelliculosa, A. punctata, Nothofagiporus venatus, Ptychogaster\nptychogaster, Rhodoantrodia tropica, R. yunnanensis, Tenuipostia\ndissecta, Wolfiporiella cartilaginea, W. curvispora, W. dilatohypha and\nWolfiporiopsis castanopsidis, are proposed. Illustrated descriptions of\nthe new species are provided. Notes and identification keys to the\ngenera of brown-rot fungi and each family within the antrodia clade are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"475","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135162.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"251","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135180.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135165","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135165.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135181","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135181.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"219","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135182.phy"}]}
