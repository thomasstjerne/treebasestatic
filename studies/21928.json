Unfortunately, Foth and Joyce employed\noutgroup taxa unrelated to turtles, ignored more parsimonious outgroup\ncandidates, and did not realize that taxa collectively known as turtles\n(traditonal clade: Testudinata) are now recovered with dual parallel\norigins. Based on these new data some cranial bones on all turtles are\nreidentified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"315","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108534","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108534.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"316","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108535","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108535.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"316","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108536.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"323","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108537.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"338","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108538.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"340","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108539","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108539.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"352","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108540","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108540.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"365","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108541","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108541.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"369","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108542","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108542.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"370","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108543","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108543.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"1133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108544.phy"}]}
