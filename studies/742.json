The\nascomata of Chaetosphaeria cylindrospora are gregarious, globose to\nbroadly ovoid and superficial on the substrate, with robust walls of\nstrong structural integrity. The asci of C. cylindrospora are clavate\nand long-stipitate and the ascospores are cylindrical, hyaline, and\nmultiseptate. No anamorph was formed in culture and an associated\nanamorph was found on only a single specimen. In parsimony analyses of\npartial sequences of the large subunit nrDNA, placement of C.\ncylindrospora within the genus Chaetosphaeria is well supported with\nhigh bootstrap values. Rimaconus jamaicensis has conical, immersed to\nerumpent, melanized ascomata, cylindrical, short-stipitate asci with a\nrefractive apex and hyaline, cylindrical, multiseptate ascospores that\nare bent at slightly submedian. No anamorph was formed in culture.\nFamily placement is unclear according to analyses of sequences of the\nlarge subunit nrDNA, however, it did not show affinities either to\nLasiosphaeria ovina or other members of the Sordariales sensu stricto.\nBased on morphological characters it is placed in the\nPleurotremataceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 29","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3827.phy"}]}
