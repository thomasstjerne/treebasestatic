According to the LSU and ITS rDNA\nsequences and culture morphology and micromorphology, the species\ndiffered from the species hitherto described in Sarocladium, and was\ncharacterized as a new species. The new species can produce hyphal coil\nand slimy heads. In addition, raised, cottony, moist to slimy colonies\non PDA, and adelophialides, branched conidiophores were also useful\ncharacters for distinguishing species from Sarocladium genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr104191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_104191.phy"}]}
