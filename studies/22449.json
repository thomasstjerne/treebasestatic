Species of Ramularia are\nhyphomycetes with hyaline conidiophores and conidia with distinct,\nthickened, darkened, refractive conidiogenous loci and conidial hila,\nand Mycosphaerella sexual morphs. Because of its simple morphology and\ngeneral lack of DNA data in public databases, several allied genera are\nfrequently confused with Ramularia. In order to improve the delimitation\nof Ramularia from allied genera and the circumscription of species\nwithin the genus Ramularia, a polyphasic approach based on multilocus\nDNA sequences, morphological and cultural data were used in this study.\nA total of 420 isolates belonging to Ramularia and allied genera were\ntargeted for the amplification and sequencing of six partial genes.\nAlthough Ramularia and Ramulariopsis proved to be monophyletic,\nCercosporella and Pseudocercosporella were polyphyletic. Phacellium\nisolates clustered within the Ramularia clade and the genus is thus\ntentatively reduced to synonymy under Ramularia. Cercosporella and\nPseudocercosporella isolates that were not congeneric with the ex-type\nstrains of the type species of those genera were assigned to existing\ngenera or to the newly introduced genera Teratoramularia and\nXenoramularia, respectively. Teratoramularia is a genus with\nramularia-like morphology belonging to the Teratosphaeriaceae, and\nXenoramularia was introduced to accommodate hyphomycetous species\nclosely related to Zymoseptoria. The genera Apseudocercosporella,\nEpicoleosporium, Filiella, Fusidiella, Neopseudocercosporella, and\nMycosphaerelloides were also newly introduced to accommodate species\nnoncongeneric with their purported types. A total of nine new\ncombinations and 24 new species were introduced in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished tef1 NJ phylogeny based on Fig. 2\nalignment","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 Bayesian tree","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110586","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 Unpublished first of 1000 equally most\nparsimonious trees","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110587","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 Unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110588","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished his3 NJ phylogeny","ntax":"297","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110597.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Baysian tree","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110589","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Unpublished first of 1000 equally most\nparsimonious trees","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110590","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110590.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished rpb2 NJ phylogeny based on Fig. 2\nalignment","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished ITS NJ phylogeny based on Fig. 2\nalignment","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished actA NJ phylogeny based on Fig. 2\nalignment","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110594.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished gapdh NJ phylogeny based on Fig. 2\nalignment","ntax":"299","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110595.phy"}]}
