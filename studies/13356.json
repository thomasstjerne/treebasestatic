There is a need to evaluate the new\nmethods for species tree reconstruction in order to determine what kinds\nof loci to use and the most effective sampling schemes in terms of\nnumbers of genes and numbers of individuals per species. Here we study\nsampling strategies with an empirical data set for six shorebird species\nin which we sequenced 1 mitochondrial, 12 autosomal, and 12 Z-linked\nloci for >8 individuals/species. We found that sampling greater\nnumbers of genes resulted in substantial improvements to the resolution\nof the species tree, but sampling greater numbers of individuals had\nminor effects. We found that Z-linked loci significantly outperformed\nautosomal loci at all levels of sampling, which likely resulted from the\nlower effective population size of the Z-linked loci. Therefore,\nsex-linked loci are likely to be a powerful tool for multi-locus\nphylogenetic studies. We found that adding a mitochondrial gene to a set\nof Z-linked or autosomal loci substantially improved the resolution of\nthe tree. Overall, our results help evaluate how best to maximize\nphylogenetic resolution while minimizing the costs of sequencing and\ncomputation when performing species tree analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Locus_2.3_gene_tree","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57020","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal
