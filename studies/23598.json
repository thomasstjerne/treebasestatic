Morphological characteristics, the host relationship\nand DNA sequence data for two gene regions, namely ITS and rpb2, were\ncompared to the corresponding characteristics of closely related, known\ncercosporoid species and showed that the specimens from Benin represent\na new species of Pseudocercospora. Pseudocercospora encephalarti is the\nfirst Pseudocercospora species on a species of the host genus\nEncephalartos, as well as for the whole class Cycadopsida. It was found\nto be closely associated with a species of Corynespora that could not be\nidentified in the context of the present study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora ITS and rpb2 of cercosporoid\nspecies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114948.phy"}]}
