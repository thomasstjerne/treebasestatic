Dating\nof insect and plant phylogenies allows us to test coevolutionary\nhypotheses and distinguish between the contemporaneous radiation of\ninteracting lineages versus insect \u001ahost tracking\u001a of previously\ndiversified plants. Here, we used nuclear DNA to reconstruct a molecular\nphylogeny for 100 species of Phyllonorycter leaf-mining moths and 36\noutgroup taxa. Ages for nodes in the moth phylogeny were estimated using\na combination of a penalized likelihood method and a Bayesian approach,\nwhich takes into account phylogenetic uncertainty. To convert the\nrelative ages of the moths into dates, we used an absolute calibration\npoint from the fossil record. The age estimates of (a selection of) moth\nclades were then compared with fossil-based age estimates of their host\nplants. Our results show that the principal radiation of Phyllonorycter\nleaf-mining moths occurred well after the main radiation of their\nhost-plants and may represent the dominant associational mode in the\nfossil record.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gracillariidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2392.phy"}]}
