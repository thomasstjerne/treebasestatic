Montieae consists of the sister clades Claytonia and Montia.\nIn Claytonia, there is strong support for the following clades: sect.\nLimnia, all annuals except the perennials C. sibirica and C. palustris;\nsect. Rhizomatosae, high elevation or high latitude perennials with\nrhizomatous or caudicose growth habits; and sect. Claytonia, species\nwith spheric or obconic underground perennation structures. All analyses\nrecover clades of Montia circumscribed as sections Montiastrum,\nAustraliensis and Montia. Heenan\u001as australasian Neopaxia is placed\nrobustly in Montia sect. Australiensis, a clade limited primarily to\nAustralia and New Zealand. The ancestral area for Montieae is\nreconstructed as western North America. Beringian taxa of Claytonia\nsect. Rhizomatosae are derived from low latitude western North America\nancestors adapted to persistently wet, alpine habitats. Although we\ninfer that sect. Claytonia had multiple shifts to northern high\nlatitudes and potentially to eastern North America from western North\nAmerica, relationships among clades in this section have limited\nsupport. Habitat reconstructions show that the pleisiomorphic condition\nfor moisture regime in sect. Claytonia is largely maintained over shifts\nin elevation/latitude.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, ML-combo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_474.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, trnK/matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4411.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, ITS-full","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, ITS-reduced","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4409.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, MP-combo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4410.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Montieae, BI-combo","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4412.phy"}]}
