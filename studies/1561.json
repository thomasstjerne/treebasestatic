Isolates obtained from diseased\nplants, however, were highly variable with regard to morphology and\npathogenicity. The aim of the present study was thus to identify the\nPhomopsis species associated with die-back of rooibos. Isolates were\nsubjected to DNA sequence comparisons of the internal transcribed spacer\nregion (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) and partial sequences of the elongation factor\n1-alpha gene. Furthermore, species were also compared in glasshouse\ninoculation trials on 8-mo-old potted plants to evaluate their\npathogenicity. Five species were identified, of which D. aspalathus\n(formerly identified as D. phaseolorum, or D. phaseolorum var.\nmeridionalis) proved to be the most virulent, followed by D. ambigua,\nPhomopsis theicola, a species of Libertella and Phomopsis, respectively,\nand a newly described species, P. cuppatea. A description is also\nprovided for D. ambigua based on a newly designated epitype\nspecimen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis spp., 1 of 8 MPTs from ITS EF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2482.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis spp., 1 of 175 MPTs from ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2481.phy"}]}
