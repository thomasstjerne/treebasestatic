Species\nidentification within the genus has relied on morphological data, which\nlacks accuracy due to the overlap of several characters. In this study\nwe applied molecular identification to assess the presence of Pilobolus\nspecies. This method is more reliable than the previously used\nmorphometric analyses and the generated sequences can be used for future\nwork. Dung samples were collected from different herbivores in Nairobi\nNational Park and sporangium isolates were obtained for pure cultures.\nDNA was extracted from the pure cultures and Internal Transcribed Spacer\nregions amplified and sequenced. Two species of Pilobolus were\nidentified, Pilobolus pullus, with a high genetic affinity, and a second\ncryptic species, morphologically identified as P. crystallinus, matched\nPilobolus heterosporus. Lack of identification of other Pilobolus\nspecies, known as key species in lungworm transmission, may suggest the\nabsence of such in the sampled area.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pilobolus fungi from Africa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90203.phy"}]}
