In this study, Japanese isolates were divided into five clades and\nidentified as Neofusicoccum parvum and Neofusicoccum spp.. Three\nspecies; Neofusicoccum hyperici, Neofusicoccum miyakoense, and\nNeofusicoccum okinawaense are proposed as new species. Furthermore,\nNeofusicoccum laricinum which is causing shoot blight of Larch is\ntransferred the genus Physalospora to the genus Neofusicoccum and\nestablished its epitype and ex-epitype.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum in Japan","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126546.phy"}]}
