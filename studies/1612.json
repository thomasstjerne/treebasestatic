We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to\nunravel specific limits and relationships in the South American group of\nHypochaeris (c.Â 40 species). The Moroccan endemic H. angustifolia, which\nis sister to the entire South American group, was used as outgroup. Our\nAFLP analysis comprises 415 individuals from 32 South American species\nand is based on six primer combinations with 670 fragments scored. It\nprovides important information for the delimitation of species and\ndetection of closely related species pairs or groups. Most species are\nmonophyletic and supported with > 90 % bootstrap proportion.\nHybridization is suggested between H. chillensis and H. microcephala in\nBrazil. The basal nodes (or \u001abackbone\u001a) of the phylogenetic tree are not\nhighly supported, but four major groups (also showing similarity in\ndistribution and growth form) center around H. tenuifolia, H.\nsessiliflora, H. microcephala, and H. pampasica. These results suggest\nthat rapid migration into different geographical regions played an\nimportant role in the initial diversification of Hypochaeris in South\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochaeris tenuifolia group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4496.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochaeris sessiliflora group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4495.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"South American Hypochaeris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4497.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochaeris microcephala group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4498.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochaeris pampasica group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4499.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Southwestern species of the Hypochaeris pampasica\ngroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4500.phy"}]}
