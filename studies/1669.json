In part due to its large size and\ntropical center of diversity, resolving evolutionary relationships\nacross Solanum as a whole has been challenging. In order to identify\nmajor clades within Solanum and to gain insight into phylogenetic\nrelationships among these clades, we sampled 102 Solanum species and\nseven outgroup taxa for three DNA sequence regions (chloroplast ndhF and\ntrnT-F and nuclear waxy) and analyzed the data using parsimony and\nBayesian methods. The same major Solanum clades were identified by each\ndata partition, and the combined analysis provided the best resolved\nhypothesis of relationships within the genus. Our data suggest that most\ncurrently recognized Solanum subgenera are not monophyletic. The\nThelopodium clade is sister to the rest of Solanum, which is split into\ntwo large clades. These two large clades are further divided into at\nleast 10 subclades, for which informal names are provided and\nmorphological synapomorphies are proposed. The identification of these\nsubclades provides a framework for directed sampling in further\nphylogenetic studies and identifies natural groups for focused\nrevisionary work.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict tree","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2612.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2613.phy"}]}
