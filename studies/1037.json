The\nectomycorrhizae formed by Lactarius tesquorum on Cistus sp., one of the\nmost common and ecologically relevant shrubs in the semi-arid regions in\nthe Mediterranean basin, are described here in terms of morphological,\nanatomical, and molecular features. An ITS rDNA sequence-based\nphylogenetic analysis was performed on the related European Lactarius\ntaxa (L. mairei, L. pubescens, L. scoticus, L. spinosulus, L.\ntorminosulus and L. torminosus) currently classified together with L.\ntesquorum in the subgenus Piperites section Piperites. The Piperites\ns.s. could be divided into two main clusters; L. mairei and especially\nL. spinosulus were less closely related to the other taxa. This study is\npart of a broader frame aiming at extending our knowledge of the\ndistribution, phylogeny, and ectomycorrhizal biology of Lactarius\nspecies in selected ecosystems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piperites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5795.phy"}]}
