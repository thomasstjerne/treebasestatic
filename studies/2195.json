Recently, a leaf blight disease was noted on several E.\naltensteinii palms growing at the foot of Table Mountain in the\nKirstenbosch Botanical Gardens of South Africa. Preliminary isolations\nfrom dead and dying leaves of E. altensteinii, E. lebomboensis and E.\nprinceps, collected from South Africa, as well as Tokyo Island, Japan,\nrevealed the presence of several novel microfungi on this host.\nNovelties include Phaeomoniella capensis, Saccharata kirstenboschensis,\nSclerostagonospora encephalarti, Teratosphaeria altensteinii, T.\nencephalarti, and Toxicocladosporium tokyoense. New host records of\nspecies previously only known to occur on Proteaceae include\nCladophialophora proteae and Catenulostroma microsporum, as well as a\nhyperparasite, Dactylaria leptosphaeriicola, occurring on ascomata of T.\nencephalarti.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"One of 40 equally most parsimonious trees.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3118.phy"}]}
