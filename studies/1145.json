This study represents the first effort to\ncombine variable regions of RPB1 and RPB2 with nLSU-rDNA for low-level\nphylogenetic studies in mushroom-forming fungi. Combination of the three\nloci increases non-parametric bootstrap support, Bayesian likelihood\nposterior probabilities, and resolution for numerous clades compared to\nseparate gene analyses. These data suggest the evolution of at least\nfive major lineages in Inocybe√≥the Inocybe clade, the Mallocybe clade,\nthe Auritella clade, the Inosperma clade, and the Pseudosperma clade.\nAdditionally, many clades nested within each major lineage are strongly\nsupported. These results also suggest the family Crepiodataceae sensu\nstricto is sister to Inocybe. Recognition of Inocybe at the family\nlevel, the Inocybaceae, is recommended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1765.phy"}]}
