Recently, four additional species have been described i from\nEucalyptus species and S. cumini in China as well as S. aromaticum and\nEucalyptus in Indonesia. Inoculation trials have shown that all\nCeloporthe species, including those that have not been found on\nEucalyptus species in nature, are pathogenic to Eucalyptus and they are\nthus potentially threatening to commercial Eucalyptus forestry. New\nisolates, morphologically similar to Celoporthe have been collected from\nS. legatti in South Africa and S. guineense in Zambia. Multigene\nphylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences of the ITS region of the\nribosomal operon, Translation Elongation Factor 1α gene and two areas in\nthe β-tubulin gene revealed additional cryptic species in Celoporthe.\nPhylogenetic data were supported by morphological differences. These\nresulted in the description of two previously unknown species of\nCeloporthe, namely Cel. fontana and Cel. woodiana, for two of these\ncryptic groups, while the third group represented Cel. dispersa. These\nspecies can all readily infect Eucalyptus as well as several species of\nSyzygium, the latter of which are native to Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50984.phy"}]}
