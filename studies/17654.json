The largest species belong in a single clade,\nwhile substantial variation remains scattered across the remainder of\ngroups. We seek out to explore the details of this size variation in an\nevolutionary framework. To this end, we first reconstructed the\nphylogeny of didelphids based on an extensive sample of sequences from\n10 genes. We recovered a fully resolved, extraordinarily robust\nphylogeny that tested and confirmed most previously reported groupings,\nproviding a simultaneous depiction of phylogenetic relationships for 81%\nof currently recognized species and all relevant supra-specific clades.\nAs much as 69% of total size variation in didelphids was explained by\nthis tree. Mapped on it, size variation evolved as much as 6.7 kg of\nchanges, starting from a reconstructed ancestral body mass range of\n22-33 g. No single, family-wide pattern was evident; in fact, the\ndominant pattern for size variation was that of increases in body mass\nalong a few successive branches, or phyletic giantism, followed by\napomorphic nanism (decreases localized in single branches). Phyletic\ntrends indicated the persistence of gradual, directional changes along\nconsiderable spans of geological time. We conclude that evolutionary\nsize variation of substantial interest may reside in groups of small\nmammals, which should be explored further in more groups in the light of\nrobust phylogenetic reconstructions as in didelphid marsupials.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximun Likelihood_Best.tree","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87861","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87861.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony_Implied Weighting (strict.consensus)","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87862.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony_Equal Weighting (strict.consensus)","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87863.phy"}]}
