Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for\nmitigating biodiversity loss and recovering critical ecosystem services\nto humanity, but restoration rarely takes into account the evolutionary\nattributes of the community being restored. Phylogenetic diversity (PD)\nrepresents a potentially valuable measure of restoration success because\nit can correlate with functional trait diversity that drives ecosystem\nfunction. However, PD patterns in restored communities are rarely\nassessed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"270","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tallgrass prairie plant communities MATK RBCL\nSUPER2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94055.phy"}]}
