The fungus is described as a new species\nof Hydropisphaera in the ascomycete order Hypocreales in the family\nBionectriaceae. This new species of Hydropisphaera has the following\ncharacteristics: ascomata subglobose to globose, 310-420 \u001aÊm diam \u001a~\n280-350 \u001aÊm high, with faint to distinct flattened, apex, 140-210 um\ndiam. Ascospores 8.9-10.6 \u001a~ 4.3-5.9 \u001aÊm, short fusiform, one-septate,\nfaintly striate. An Acremonium-like anamorph is produced in dual\nculture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MB tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydropisphaera fungicola Rossman, Farr &\nNewcombe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5126.phy"}]}
