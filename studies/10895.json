We combined species and abundance data with that\nobtained in an earlier study to re-evaluate current knowledge about\ndiversity of cultivable endophytes in Fagus sylvatica foliage. Fungal\nITS sequences were used for identification and phylogenetic analysis,\nfor the evaluation of morphotype concepts, and for validation of\nmorphological identification. Morphological and molecular delimitation\nof isolates corresponded well and did not significantly change values\nfor species richness estimators. The present analyses largely increased\nthe known species richness of beech endophytes from 64 to 83 observed\nand about 100 estimated taxa. According to the ITS phylogeny, beech leaf\nendophytes belong to the main non-parasitic and non-lichenised orders of\nPezizomycotina and have close affinities to plant and insect\npathogens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Foliar Endophytes from Beech","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_22194.phy"}]}
