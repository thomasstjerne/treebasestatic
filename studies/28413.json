A\ncomprehensive phylogenetic analysis of Golovinomyces in 2013 revealed\nthat G. cichoracearum s. str. confined to Scorzonera and Tragopogon\n(Asteraceae: Lactuceae). To clarify which species of this complex on\nHieracium are present in Europe (Bashkortostan, Germany, and Slovakia)\nand parts of Asia (China). Morphological examinations and phylogenetic\nanalyses of ITS+ 28S rDNA sequences were conducted from 53 powdery\nmildew specimens of Hieracium and L. communis.
