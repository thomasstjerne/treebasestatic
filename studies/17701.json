Based on sequence similarity of their\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions and D1/D2 domains, the\nisolated strains were classified into three species; Mrakia blollopis\n(18 strains), M. gelida (7 strains), and M. robertii (2 strains). All of\nthe strains produced ethanol from glucose at 10 °C. Six strains selected\nfrom the 27 isolates were then tested for ethanol fermentation and\nethanol tolerance at 100 g/l glucose. Mrakia blollopis SK-4 and M.\nblollopis NRI-4 completely consumed the glucose within 13 d and 6 d of\nfermentation respectively, and demonstrated high ethanol yields and\nethanol tolerance. In contrast, M. blollopis AGK-3 and M. blollopis\nTKG1-2 exhibited low ethanol yields and poor ethanol tolerance. These\nresults indicate that ethanol yields of different Mrakia species may\ndepend on ethanol tolerance in individual strains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mrakia spp. ITS and D1D2 domain sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97611.phy"}]}
