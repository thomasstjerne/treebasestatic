Where these fungi come from is not known yet.\nTwo scenarios of fungus recruitment are possible: (1) random infection\nthrough spores or hyphal fragments from the environment, or (2)\ntransmission from mother to daughter colonies by the foundress queen. It\nis also not known at which stage of the colony life cycle fungiculture\nis initiated, and whether the- symbiont fungi serve as food for the ant\nqueen. To clarify these questions, we investigated four Azteca ant\nspecies inhabiting three different Cecropia species (C. insignis, C.\nobtusifolia, and C. peltata). We analysed an rRNA gene fragment from 52\nfungal patches produced by founding queens and compared them with those\nfrom established Azteca colonies (n = 54). The infrabuccal pockets of\nwinged queens were dissected to investigate whether young queens carry\nfungi from their mother colony. Additionally, 15N labelling experiments\nwere done to verify whether the queen feeds on the patches until she is\nnourished by her first worker offspring. We infer from the results that\nthe fungi cultivated in hollow plant structures are transferred from the\nparental colony of the young queen. First, fungal genotypes/OTU\ndiversity was not significantly different between foundress queen\npatches and established colonies, and second, hyphal parts were\ndiscovered in the infrabuccal pockets of female alates. We could show\nthat fungiculture already starts before queens lay their eggs, and that\nthe queens do not feed on fungal patch material but feed it to the\nlarvae. Our findings suggest that fungiculture may be crucial for\nsuccessful colony founding of arboreal ants in the tropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"K2&I&G","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cecropia-tree ant fungus K2+I+G","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109068.phy"}]}
