A\nmolecular study based on the combined ITS (internal transcribed spacer\nregion) and nLSU (the large nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit) dataset\ndemonstrated the studied samples formed a new lineage in\nHaploporus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113021","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113021.phy"}]}
