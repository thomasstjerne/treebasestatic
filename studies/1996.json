The group is characterized by inflorescences\nthat appear to emerge directly from the hosts\u001a stems. Eight lineages were\nrecognized, with two of them proposed here as new species: C. punana\nfrom Ecuador and C. vandevenderi from Mexico. Cuscuta colombiana is\nredefined to include C. aristeguietae, and C. deltoidea is broadened to\nencompass C. serruloba. A taxonomic treatment with an identification\nkey, descriptions, and illustrations is provided; the biogeography and\nconservation status of the eight species are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cuscuta gracillima complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_359.phy"}]}
