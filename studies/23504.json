It is the causal agent of crown and root\nrot in strawberry. We collected 101 F. solani isolates from diseased\nplants and soils from two distinct geographic areas of strawberry\nproduction in Spain: plant nurseries located in the North-Center of the\ncountry, and fruit production fields located in the South-West.\nMultilocus DNA sequences were constructed for the molecular\nidentification of the isolates via Fusarium MLST online database, and to\nassess the phylogenetic relationships and diversity of the populations.\nIn addition, the vegetative compatibility between isolates was analyzed\nbased on complementation tests involving nitrate non-utilizing (nit)\nmutants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all strawberry-associated\nisolates were restricted to Clade 3 of FSSC. Forty-nine isolates from\nnursery population comprised of 4 distinct phylogenetic species i.e.,\nFSSC 2 (F. keratoplasticum), FSSC 5 (F. solani sensu stricto), FSSC 9,\nand an unknown FSSC species, that matched with 5 vegetative\ncompatibility groups (VCGs). Fifty-two isolates from fruit production\nfields comprised 5 strongly supported phylogenetic species i.e., FSSC 2,\nFSSC 3+4 (F. falciforme), FSSC 5, FSSC 6 (F. metavorans sp. nov.), and\nFSSC 11, distributed into 31 VCGs. Genetic and VCG variability of fruit\nproduction fields population was higher than those from nurseries.\nGenetic diversity analyses suggested that nurseries and fruit production\nfields are two different populations. The fact that some phylogenetic\ngroups shared isolates from both populations, that heterocarion\nformation was detected between isolates from both populations, and that\nisolates from soils and diseased plants shared the same haplotype,\nsuggests that infected runner plants and soils could be potential\nsources of inoculum of FSSC in fruit production fields.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115187","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115187.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115188","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115188.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115189.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115190.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115194","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115194.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115192.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115193","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115193.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115191.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115195","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115197","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115196","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115196.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115198","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115198.phy"}]}
