The systematic position of Cainiella has been unclear for\na long time with current classifications placing the genus in either\nSordariales or Xylariales. Our molecular results, based on mtSSU, ITS\nand nLSU rDNA data, clearly show that the genus belongs in the\nSydowiellaceae, Diaporthales. The study also includes new sequences of\nSydowiellaceae, and contributes to a better knowledge of the\nphylogenetic relationship of that family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sydowiellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48049.phy"}]}
