In\nthis study, species diversity, phylogenetic relationships and ecological\nhabits of Fomitopsis were investigated. A total of 195 specimens from 24\ncountries representing 29 species of Fomitopsis were studied. Based on\nthe morphological characters and phylogenetic evidence of DNA sequences\nof multiple loci including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregions, the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small\nsubunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit\nmitochondrial rRNA gene sequences (mtSSU), the translation elongation\nfactor 1-Î± gene (TEF) and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II\n(RPB2), 30 species are accepted in Fomitopsis, including four new\nspecies, F. resupinatus, F. srilankensis, F. submeliae and F.\nyimengensis. Illustrated descriptions of the novel species and the\ngeographical locations of the Fomitopsis species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135240.phy"}]}
