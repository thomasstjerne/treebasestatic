In the last years,\nPythium-induced rot has caused the death of cactus (Nopalea\ncochenillifera) plants in the Brazilian semi-arid region. In the present\nstudy, two Pythium isolates were obtained from N. cochenillifera plants\nin Santana do Ipanema County, State of Alagoas, Brazil. Based on\nmorphological and molecular data [partial sequences of the regions\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2\n(Cox2)], the isolates reported here were identified as P.\naphanidermatum. These isolates were pathogenic on cladodes of N.\ncochenillifera. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P.\naphanidermatum causing cladode and foot rots on cactus (N.\ncochenillifera) worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92851.phy"}]}
