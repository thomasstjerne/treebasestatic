Five species of Ophioceras were resolved and one\nspecies was excluded from the genus. Based on phylogenetic analysis of\npartial 18S rDNA sequences, species of Pseudohalonectria form a sister\nclade to Ophioceras thereby supporting the integrity but close\nrelationship of these two freshwater genera. Gaeumannomyces graminis\nfalls within the Ophioceras/Pseudohalonectria clade and is a sister\ntaxon to a species of Ophioceras. This calls to question the reliability\nof the morphological and biological characters currently used to\nseparate Gaeumannomyces from Ophioceras. In parsimony analyses,\nOphioceras and Pseudohalonectria are more closely related to two species\nin the Ophiostomatales than to species in the Sordariales or\nDiaporthales. However, such a relationship is not evident in\nanalyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophioceras","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_212.phy"}]}
