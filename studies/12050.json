The core focus is on nature\ndiscovery  identifying and describing new species of plants and animals.\nThe Bush Blitz program has enabled the collection and description of\nbeeflies (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from surveys in Western Australia and\nQueensland. Three new species of Australian beeflies belonging to the\nExoprosopini are described; Palirika mackenziei Lambkin sp. n., Palirika\nculgoafloodplainensis Lambkin sp. n., and Larrpana bushblitz Lambkin sp.\nn.. Phylogenetic analysis of 40 Australian exoprosopine species\nbelonging to the Balaana generic-group Lambkin & Yeates 2003\nsupports the placement of the three new species into existing genera,\nand the erection and description of the new genus Ngalki Lambkin gen.\nn. for Ngalki trigonium (Lambkin & Yeates 2003) comb. n.. Revised\nkeys are provided for the genera of the Australian Balaana genus-group\nand the species of Palirika Lambkin & Yeates, 2003 and Larrpana\nLambkin & Yeates 2003. With the description of the three new species\nand the transferral of Munjua trigona Lambkin & Yeates 2003 into the\nnew genus Ngalki Lambkin gen. n., three genera are rediagnosed; Munjua\nLambkin & Yeates 2003, Palirika and Larrpana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Australian Exoprosopini MPT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Exoprosopini MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49232.phy"},{"tree_label":"World Exoprosopini 2003 78taxa MPT","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"World Exoprosopini 2003 78taxa chosen MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49234.phy"},{"tree_label":"Australian Exoprosopini 2003 46 taxa MPT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Exoprosopini 2003 46 taxa MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49293.phy"}]}
