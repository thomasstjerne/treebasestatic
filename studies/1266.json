Although appendages of the ascomata are uncinula-like,\ni.e., unbranched with curved-coiled apices, U. septata is situated at\nthe very base of the large Erysiphales cluster, far away from the\nepseudoidium clade (Erysiphe emend., incl.Â Microsphaera and Uncinula).\nMorphologically, U. septata differs from the species of Erysiphe sect.\nUncinula (= Uncinula) in having terminal, pluriseptate ascoma\nappendages, curved ascospores, and the absense of an anamorph. This\nspecies is a basal, tree-inhabiting powdery mildew with some additional\nancestral characteristics, viz., uncinula-like appendages and 8-spored\nasci. The new genus Parauncinula with U. septata as the type species is\nproposed. Uncinula curvispora (= U. septata var. curvispora) is\ntentatively maintained as a separate species, which is also assigned to\nParauncinula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parauncinula septata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4413.phy"}]}
