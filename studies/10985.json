In the\nhope of improving our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, we expanded\nsampling of taxa and genes beyond previous analyses. Methods: We\nconducted two primary analyses based on 640 species representing 330\nfamilies. The first included 25,260 aligned base pairs (bp) from 17\ngenes (representing all three plant genomes, i.e., nucleus, plastid, and\nmitochondrion). The second included 19,846 aligned bp from 13 genes\n(representing only the nucleus and plastid). Key Results: Many important\nquestions of deep-level relationships in the non-monocot angiosperms\nhave now been resolved with strong support. Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales,\nand Austrobaileyales are successive sisters to the remaining angiosperms\n(Mesangiospermae), which are resolved into Chloranthales + Magnoliidae\nas sister to Monocotyledoneae + [Ceratophyllaceae + Eudicotyledoneae].\nEudicotyledoneae contains a basal grade subtending Gunneridae. Within\nGunneridae, Gunnerales are sister to the remainder (Pentapetalae), which\ncomprises: 1) Superrosidae, consisting of Rosidae (including Vitaceae)\nand Saxifragales; and 2) Superasteridae, comprising Berberidopsidales,\nSantalales, Caryophyllales, Asteridae, and, based on this study,\nDilleniaceae (although other recent analyses disagree with this\nplacement). Within the major subclades of Pentapetalae most deep-level\nrelationships are resolved with strong support. Conclusions: Our\nanalyses confirm that with large amounts of sequence data, most\ndeep-level relationships within the angiosperms can be resolved. We\nanticipate that this well-resolved angiosperm tree will be of broad\nutility for many areas of biology, including physiology, ecology,\npaleobiology, and genomics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.18S 26S ML10","ntax":"536","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25536.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.WITH MT ML10","ntax":"640","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25533.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.WITH MT POLYOSMA ML10","ntax":"640","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25534","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25534.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.NO MT ML10","ntax":"639","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25535","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25535.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.rps16 ML10","ntax":"222","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25555.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.ndhF ML10","ntax":"511","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25549","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25549.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.18S ML10","ntax":"497","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25542","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25542.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.rbcL ML10","ntax":"627","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25551","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25551.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.matK ML10","ntax":"591","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25546","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25546.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.psbBTNH ML10","ntax":"348","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25550","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25550.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML MajorityRuleConsensusTree.ONLY CP BS100\nMRCON","ntax":"639","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25540","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25540.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML MajorityRuleConsensusTree.ONLY MT BS100\nMRCON","ntax":"517","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25541","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25541.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.nad5 ML10","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25548","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25548.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.26S ML10","ntax":"364","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25543","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25543.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.atp1 ML10","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25544.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.ONLY CP ML10","ntax":"639","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25537.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.rps4 ML10","ntax":"371","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25554.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.atpB ML10","ntax":"566","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25545","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25545.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML MajorityRuleConsensusTree.18S 26S BS100\nMRCON","ntax":"536","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25539","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25539.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.ONLY MT ML10","ntax":"517","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25538.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.matR ML10","ntax":"486","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25547","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25547.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.rps3 ML10","ntax":"395","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25553","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25553.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.rpoC2 ML10","ntax":"405","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25552","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25552.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"640","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr29830","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_29830.phy"}]}
