We describe two new taxa, Geoglossomycetes and\nGeoglossales, to host three earth tongue genera: Geoglossum,\nTrichoglossum, and Sarcoleotia as a lineage of âLeotiomycetaâ.\nCorrespondingly, we confirm that these genera are not closely related to\nthe genera Neolecta, Mitrula, Cudonia, Microglossum, Thuemenidum,\nSpathularia, and Bryoglossum, all of which have been previously placed\nwithin the Geoglossaceae. We also propose a non-hierarchical system for\nnaming well-resolved nodes, such as âSaccharomycetaâ, âDothideomycetaâ,\nand âSordariomycetaâ for supraordinal nodes, within the current\nphylogeny, acting as rankless taxa. As part of this revision, the\ncontinued use of âLeotiomycetaâ, now as a rankless taxon, is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI Tree","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geoglossomycetes cl. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6953.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geoglossomycetes cl. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6766.phy"}]}
