{"Authors":" Angelo Bolzern","Year":" 2015","Title":" Unexpected occurrence of the genus Eratigena in Laos with\ndescription of a new species (Araneae: Agelenidae)","Journal":" Zootaxa","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" relict species, cave, spider","DOI":"","Abstract":" During fieldtrips to Laos in 2009 and 2012, two male\nagelenid specimens were collected from two different caves in the\nBolikhamsay Province. Examination of morphological and molecular (CO1)\ncharacters revealed, that these specimens belong to a new species,\nEratigena laksao sp. n.. The cheliceral retromargin of the examined\nspecimens have more than six teeth and the most proximal tooth is\ndistinctly smaller, two character states that are regarded as\nsynapomorphic for Eratigena. Nevertheless, due to the presence of\nventral spines at tarsus IV, the completely reduced distal sclerite at\nthe median apophysis, and the lack of females, the genus affiliation of\nthis species remains tentative. E. laksao sp. n.Â can easily be\nidentified by the unique presence of distinct bristles at the distal\npalpal tibia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tnt 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81268","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_81268.phy"},{"tree_label":"tagged tree","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81267","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_81267.phy"}]}
