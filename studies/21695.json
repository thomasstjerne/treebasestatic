J. aquatica is characterized by its flared\nconidiophores with percurrent proliferations, monoblastic, terminal or\nintercalary, cylindrical conidiogenous cells, and subglobose to broadly\nellipsoidal conidia with transverse and oblique septa. A phylogenetic\ntree of Acrodictys-like species was inferred from multi-locus (SSU, ITS\nand LSU) sequences. A key to the species of Junewangia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Junewangiaceae 18S, ITS and 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110823.phy"}]}
