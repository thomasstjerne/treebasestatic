Using a combination of\nmorphological characteristics and multigene (ITS, SSU, LSU, TEF)\nphylogenics, the isolates were identified as a Metapochonia species\nwhich were previously undescribed. Metapochonia hahajimaensis, a new\nspecies, is distinguished from the closely-related M. bulbillosa and M.\ngonioides or other Metapochonia taxa by conidial size and colonial\ncharacteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr122544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122544.phy"}]}
