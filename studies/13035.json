It has been observed previously that their diversity\ndecreases with increasing latitude and altitude. Here we look at\ndictyostelid diversity in the high latitude habitats of Northern Sweden.\nDictyostelids were recovered from soil samples using traditional plating\nmethods and then identified using morphological characters and molecular\nsequence (ribosomal small subunit) data. In total, nine species were\nrecovered, including two new species, described herein as Dictyostelium\nbarbibulus and Polysphondylium fuscans. The species diversity found here\nis discussed in relation to previous findings in the area as well as\nother high-latitude studies, and biogeographical patterns are examined.\nThe total number of species found in Northern Sweden is lower than the\nnumbers recorded for regions further south in Europe, a finding\nconsistent with a latitudinal gradient of species diversity. Our\nfindings highlight the benefit of using molecular data for proper\nspecies identification in Dictyostelia, and the need for a continued\nsampling effort to better understand their diversity and distribution,\nespecially in high latitude habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyostelid social amoebae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55289.phy"}]}
