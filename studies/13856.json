Phylogenetic\nanalysis of 86 anguimorph taxa coded with 435 morphological characters\nand four genes confirms the placement of Estesia mongoliensis in a\nmonophyletic Monstersauria. Extant monstersaurs, the genus Heloderma,\nare the only extant lizards bearing venom-transmitting teeth with a deep\nvenom grove in the rostral carina. Compared to the crown group, stem\nmonstersaurs are morphologically more variable in venom-delivery\napparatus. This study has found that Estesia mongoliensis has two\nshallow grooves in the rostral and caudal carinae of its dentary teeth,\ndemonstrating a primary venom-delivery apparatus. A summary of\nvenom-delivering tooth specialization in the Anguimorpha is provided,\nand related morphological characters are optimized on the strict\nconsensus tree resulting from the combined morphological and molecular\nanalysis of anguimorph phylogeny. The phylogeny supports a single\norigination of venom grooves in the Monstersauria, and indicates that\ngrooved teeth are currently the only reliable venom-delivery apparatus\nto be recognized in fossil lizards.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anguimorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60653.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hennig 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anguimorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60654.phy"}]}
