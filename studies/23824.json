R. subbrevipes has only been\nfound at altitudes of higher than 3400 m in south-western China so far\nand is characterised by the yellow ochre pileal surface, glabrous or\ntomentose stipe, fruity odour, subglobose to ellipsoid basidiospores\n(7.69.4 ´ 6.48 µm), isolated or partial connected warts and\npleurocystidia with a cap appendage. R. callainomarginis is\ncharacterised by cream to white pileus, light turquoise lamellae margin,\nspongy stipe, light turquoise zone on the top of stipe, pungent odour,\nglobose to ellipsoid basidiospores (6.48.3 ´ 5.77.4 µm) and dominant\nisolated warts. The phylogeny of Russula is reconstructed with\nmulti-gene sequences including the internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS), the large subunit (nrLSU), the small subunit of the mitochondrial\nrRNA gene (mtSSU), and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2).\nThe results show that both R. subbrevipes and R. callainomarginis\nrepresent new lineages in Russula subg. Brevipes. Illustrated\ndescriptions of the two new species are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115511.phy"}]}
