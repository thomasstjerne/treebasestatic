Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA region\nindicated that P. simplicissimum s.l. includes several species.\nRecognition of these species is further supported by differences in\nmicromorphological characters, particularly of the conidia and\nphialides, and the production of distinct profiles of secondary\nmetabolites by each species. Group-I introns were identified in six of\nthe 21 isolates; their presence was used to test hypotheses about the\nmonophyly of the P. pulvillorum and the other intron-bearing strains.\nOur results show that P. brasilianum, P. ochrochloron, P. piscarium, P.\npulvillorum and P. simplicissimum should be recognized as distinct and\nvalid species. Three additional, undescribed species were identified\nwithin the P. simplicissimum group, here referred to as Penicillium spp.\nI, II and III. The name P. simplicissimum should be used only for\nisolates which match the neotype and NRRL 902 in all characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium simplicissimum senus lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium simplicissimum senus lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3701.phy"}]}
