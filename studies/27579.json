Internal Transcribed Spacer\n(ITS) sequence analysis indicated that they belonged to two previously\nunknown species of Nothophytophthora, a recently erected sister genus of\nPhytophthora. Morphological and temperature-growth studies were carried\nout to characterise both new species. In addition, Bayesian and\nMaximum-Likelihood analyses of nuclear 5-loci and mitochondrial 3-loci\ndatasets were performed to resolve the phylogenetic positions of the two\nnew species. Both species were sterile, formed chlamydospores and\npartially caducous nonpapillate sporangia,and showed slower growth than\nany of the six known Nothophytophthora species. In all phylogenetic\nanalyses both species formed distinct, strongly supported clades,\nclosely related to N. chlamydospora and N. valdiviana from Chile. Based\non their unique combination of morphological and physiological\ncharacters and their distinct phylogenetic positions the two new species\nare described as Nothophytophthora irlandica sp. nov. and N. lirii sp.\nnov. Their potential lifestyle and geographic origin are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree_ML_NothoIR_NuclearGenes","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothophytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_129985.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI NothoIR NuclearGenes","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothophytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_129984.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_BI_NothoIR_MitochondrialGenes","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothophytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_129986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree_ML_NothoIR_MitochondrialGenes","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothophytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_129987.phy"}]}
