The generic groups were used to sample representative\ngenera for a cladistic analysis based on morphological characters. The\nresulting cladogram was used for discussion of evolution and subtribal\nclassification within the tribe. The lower basic chromosome numbers x =\n4, 5, 6, and 8 are interpreted as reductions from a primitive x = 9. The\nsubtribe Grangeinae occupies a phylogenetically basal position as sister\ngroup to the rest of the tribe. This may be divided into two large\ngroups, largely corresponding to the homochromous Solidagininae and to\nthe heterochromous Asterinae sensu lato, i.e.Â including the Bellidinae,\nHinterhuberinae, Conyzinae, and Baccharidinae. The latter four subtribes\nare derived within the Asterinae, and hence reduced to synonymy. Several\nintercontinental relationships indicate that a geographical subdivision\nof the tribe should be avoided, although in our analysis most of the\ngroups proved to be restricted to one of five major regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astereae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astereae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astereae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4284.phy"}]}
