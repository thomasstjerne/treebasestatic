This study aims to complete a\nmorphological description of the putative new species and use DNA\nsequence data of six gene loci (SSU, LSU, ITS, Î²-tubulin, EF1, and RPB2)\nto accurately place the putative new species within the\nBotryosphaeriales. Morphological comparisons have shown that this\nputative new species is distinct from S. pini-thunbergii. Comparison of\nDNA sequence data has further confirmed our morphological findings,\nindicating the classification of a new species which we describe as\nSeptorioides strobi sp. nov., marking the first report of the genus\nSeptorioides within the U.S. Subsequently, our phylogenetic analysis has\nfurther revealed that S. pini-thunbergii and S. strobi do not reside\nwithin the Botryosphaereace, but comprise a new family within the order\nBotryosphaeriales we recognize as Septorioideaceae fam. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95027","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95027.phy"}]}
