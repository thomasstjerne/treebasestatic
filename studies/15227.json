C.\ncarolina is a heterotrophic, obligately anaerobic amoeboid flagellate,\nand superficially resembles Mastigamoeba (Amoebozoa: Archamoebae) or\nBreviata (Breviatea) by possessing a single anterior flagellum. However,\nits life cycle contains multiflagellate cells with unusual morphology.\nThe structure of the mastigont of C. carolina is unique and not readily\ncomparable with any eukaryotic group. Unexpectedly, phylogenetic\nanalyses of SSU rDNA and concatenate of Î±- and Î²-tubulin genes with\nSSU rDNA convincingly showed that C. carolina is a member of\nHeterolobosea and specifically belongs to Tetramitia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"large SSU analysis - RAxML best tree","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71882","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71882.phy"},{"tree_label":"large SSU analysis - Phylobayes tree","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71883","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71883.phy"},{"tree_label":"large SSU analysis - RAxML bootstrap tree","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71884","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71884.phy"}]}
