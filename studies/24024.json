After bringing these strains\ninto axenic culture, we studied their thallus development and molecular\nphylogeny. Thalli produce operculate sporangia of variable shapes, from\nspherical, pyriform to multilobed, and rhizoidal systems with a\nsub-sporangial tube or swelling. Resting spores are endobiotic when\nstrains are grown on sweet gum pollen. Molecular phylogeny of 28S rDNA\nsequences place these eight strains in the Chytriomycetaceae. Based on\ntheir thallus morphology, molecular phylogeny and zoospore\nultrastructural features, we classify these strains as a new genus,\nRodmanochytrium, with two new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"best","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chitinophylic Chytrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116136.phy"}]}
