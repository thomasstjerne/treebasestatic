This is due, in a large part,\nto the recent molecular work that has confirmed previous morphological\nstudies and concluded that the genus is not monophyletic. At least five\nmonophyletic lineages have been defined within the genus and, based\nlargely on molecular data, these are distributed throughout the tribes\nAcacieae, Ingeae and Mimoseae of the Mimosoideae. We provide new and\nreview previous molecular data used to redefine the generic\nclassification of the genus into five segregate genera. This molecular\nphylogenetic data provides evidence for well-supported monophyletic\nlineages. The debate on the nomenclatural implications of which\nphylogenetic level is recognized at the generic level is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figs 1 and 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48015","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48015.phy"}]}
