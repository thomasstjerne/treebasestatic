Numerous\ndating analyses have recently precipitated a paradigm shift in the\ngeneral explanations for the phenomenon, away from older geological\ncauses, such as continental drift, in favour of more recent,\nlong-distance dispersal (LDD). For example, the ‘Gondwanan vicariance’\nscenario has been dismissed in various studies of Indian Ocean disjunct\ndistributions. We used the gentian tribe Exaceae to reassess this\nscenario using molecular dating with minimum (fossil), maximum\n(geological), secondary (from wider analyses) and hypothesis-driven age\nconstraints. Our results indicate that ancient vicariance cannot be\nruled out as an explanation for the early origins of Exaceae across\nAfrica, Madagascar and the Indian subcontinent unless a strong\nassumption is made about the maximum age of Gentianales. However, both\nthe Gondwanan scenario and the available evidence suggest that there\nwere also several, more recent, inter-continental dispersals during the\ndiversification of the group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREES1","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exaceae trnL intron, ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87940.phy"}]}
