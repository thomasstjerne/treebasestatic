DNA barcoding methods are among the useful approaches to\nelucidate the complicated species diversity and evolution of\nPotamogeton. Here we use this methods to preliminary investigate\ndiversity and hybridization of Potamogeton in Argentina. The results of\natpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH, trnK-matK 5â intron, and rpl20-rps12 as\nwell as 5S-NTS and ITS shows three species and one hybrid-originated\ntaxon. Simultaneously performed molecular phylogenetic analyses showed\nsignificant topological incongruences between chloroplast DNA and\nnuclear DNA trees. This implies hybridization or hybridization followed\nby polyploidization between P. berteroanus and possibly P.\nferrugineus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"587","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89986","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89986.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89987","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89987.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89988.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89989","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89989.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89990","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89990.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89991.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89992","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89992.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89993","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89993.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89994","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89994.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89997","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89997.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89996","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89996.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89998","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89998.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89999","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89999.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90000","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90000.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90001","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90001.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90002","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90002.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90003","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90003.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90004","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90004.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90005","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90005.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90006","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90006.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90007.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90008.phy"}]}
