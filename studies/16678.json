It is characterized by brown, minute, punctiform scales,\naround the large scales at the centre of the pileus, the stipe with\nconcolourous fibrils, a strong reddening when bruised and cut, and\nmicroscopically, the variable shaped cheilocystidia, with 0â“3 septa in\ndeveloping stage. The phylogenetic results based on ITS and nrLSU\nsequences suggest that Hymenagaricus is paraphyletic and has a close\nrelationship with Heinemannomyces. The results also provide preliminary\nmolecular evidence supporting the elevation of subgenera Hymenagaricus\nand Xanthagaricus to the genera rank.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr79694","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79694.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr79695","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79695.phy"}]}
