The species has variable\ncopies of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, requiring\ncloning of these regions prior to Sanger sequencing before subsequent\nuse in phylogenetic comparisons with other fungi. The genome of the\nstrain was sequenced using short paired-reads to yield a draft genome of\n28.6 Mb. Syncephalastrum contaminatum is distinguished by diverse DNA\nsequences at several loci from the other species of Syncephalastrum,\nincluding only 81% sequence identity with its ITS regions to that of S.\nracemosum. Its merosporangium produces four or more asexual spores and\nthe genome sequencing information suggests that the species is\nheterothallic. The identification of this species highlights the limited\nknowledge about the early lineages of fungi both in Australia and\nglobally.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121970.phy"}]}
