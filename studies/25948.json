Although\nthe fruiting bodies were dispersed on unidentified senescent bryophytes\ngrowing on a moist rock surface, the hyphae were not associated with the\nbryophyte cells. Instead, we confirmed that the hyphae loosely\nsurrounded spherical algal cells present on the surface of bryophytes to\nform an undifferen- tiated thallus. The observations by transmission\nelectron microscopy revealed that the alga had a pyrenoid. Morphological\ncharacters of B. phycophila were similar to those of lichenized species\nin the genus Multiclavula, but the new species differs from the latter\nin that it does not form a globular or bulbil-like thallus. Molecular\nsequence data ofthe large subunit ofthe nuclear ribosomal RNA gene\nshowed that the species was placed in a new lineage in the order\nCantharellales, clearly independent from the genus Multiclavula. A\nmultispore isolate ofB. phycophila was successfully established and the\nbrief cultural characteristics are described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"result","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128195.phy"}]}
