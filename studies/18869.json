In this paper, we introduce P. pandanicola sp. nov.,\nwith an illustrated account. Evidence for the new species is provided by\ndistinct morphology and phylogenetic analyses. This is also the first\nreport of the sexual morph of Parasarcopodium. The phylogenetic trees\nused Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined LSU, SSU, TEF1\nand RPB2 sequence data to show the placement of the new species in\nStachybotryaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parasarcopodium pandanicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97609.phy"}]}
