In this study,\nphylogenetic analyses are based on a concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and\nnrLSU sequence data of Stereaceae around the world. Three new genera and\neight new species are presented, and eight new combinations proposed. We\nare provided brief notes for each accepted genus, Acanthostereum,\nConfertotrama and Gelatinostereum, including information on\nclassification, type species and morphological descriptions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136154.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136155.phy"}]}
