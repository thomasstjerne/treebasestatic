However, this\nclassification has been controversial due to the morphological\nsimilarity with known genera Boletinus and Fuscoboletinus. Because of\nthe lack of fresh material to study, the phylogenetic position of\nPsiloboletinus has remained unknown since its publication. However, the\nrecently described species Suillus foetidus reported from northeast\nChina allows this issue to be re-examined and resolved. Through\nmorphological observations and comparison, we find that S. foetidus is a\nheterotypic synonym of Ps. lariceti. Furthermore, Psiloboletinus should\nbe retained as an independent genus sister to Suillus based on molecular\nphylogenetic evidence and morphological features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119812.phy"}]}
