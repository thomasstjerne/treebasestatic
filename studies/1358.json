Cercospora apii sensu lato is the oldest name for a large\ncomplex of morphologically indistinguishable Cercospora species\noccurring on a wide host range. There are currently 659 recognized\nCercospora species, and names of another 281 morphologically identical\nspecies are included in the synonymy of C. apii sensu lato. Two of the\nspecies that belong to the C. apii complex, namely C. apii and C.\nbeticola, cause Cercospora leaf spot on Apium graveolens (celery) and\nBeta vulgaris (sugarbeet), respectively. In the present study,\nmulti-locus sequence data, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)\nanalysis and cultural characteristics were used as additional features\nto characterize morphologically similar Cercospora strains occurring on\ncelery and sugarbeet. From the data obtained, it is shown that C. apii\nand C. beticola, although morphologically similar and able to\ncross-infect each others\u001a hosts, are distinct functional species that\nshould be retained as separate entities. Furthermore, a third, as yet\nundescribed species of Cercospora was detected in celery fields in Korea\nand Venezuela, suggesting that additional undescribed species may also\nbe found to cause Cercospora leaf spot on celery. A PCR-based diagnostic\nprotocol distinguishes all three Cercospora species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora apii morphotype, 1 of 12 MP trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_560.phy"}]}
