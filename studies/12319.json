The stunning Early\nCretaceous diversity of maniraptorans from Liaoning, China13, coupled\nwith a longevity implied by derived Late Jurassic forms such as\nArchaeopteryx, pushes the origins of maniraptoran lineages back to\nPangaean times and engenders the possibility that such lineages existed\nin Gondwana. A few intriguing, but incomplete, maniraptoran specimens\nhave been reported from South America48, Africa9 and Madagascar10. Their\naffinities remain contested1113, however, and they have been interpreted\nas biogeographic anomalies relative to other faunal components of these\nland-masses. Here we describe a near-complete, small dromaeosaurid that\nis both the most complete and the earliest member of the Maniraptora\nfrom South America, and which provides new evidence for a unique\nGondwanan lineage of Dro- maeosauridae with an origin predating the\nseparation between northern and southern landmasses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Aff.
