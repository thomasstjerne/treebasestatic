The data presented corroborate the position of\nthe genus Xeroplana as a member of the Cernuellini, and its separation\nfrom Cernuella on genus level. A short characterisation of the species\nconfined to Xeroplana is presented. The phylogenetic analysis of two\nmitochondrial markers (COI and 16S) and two nuclear markers\n(5.8S-ITS2-28S and H3) confirms the status of Sabessebia nov. gen. The\nnew genus, Sabessebia nov. gen. is proposed for Helix zitanica\nLetourneux & Bourguignat, 1887, which is also located in this tribe.\nFor the first time, genetic data of the type species of Cernuella,\nCochlea virgata Da Costa, 1778, from its type area England is published\nto support the further investigation of taxa comprised within the\nCernuella species-complex. Cernuella virgata from England is monomorphic\nfor all markers used, indicating a very close relationship of the\npopulations investigated; probably, this is result of a recent dispersal\nevent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128928.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128929.phy"}]}
