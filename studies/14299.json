During post-glacial recolonization, when reproductive\nisolation is incomplete and formerly isolated lineages meet as a result\nof range expansion at a secondary contact zone, further mating between\nthe populations will produce hybrids, resulting in the formation of a\nhybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through\npre-zygotic isolation mechanisms. Sexual selection is well recognized\nfor its important role in promoting pre-zygotic isolation through\nvariation among former allopatric and sympatric populations in\nreproductive traits. This phenomenon may dramatically accentuate\nconsequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Notwithstanding,\nthe reproductive trait divergence has not been approached in the context\nof climatic oscillations. The aim of this paper is to investigate the\nphylogeography and geographical variation of a reproductive trait (male\nmarking secretion, MMS) in the red-tailed bumblebee, Bombus lapidarius\n(L.) (Hymenoptera, Apidae) in order to compare the relation between the\nphylogeographic pattern and reproductive trait variation pattern. To\nmanage our purpose, we use a phylogeographic approach based on five\ngenes (nuclear and mitochondrial) and comparative chemical analyses of\nMMS. Our results show that Quaternary climatic oscillations have led to\nB. lapidarius population contraction in three main refugia (South Italy,\nBalkan, and Central-Eastern Europe). Populations from the South Italy\nrefugium have experienced allopatric MMS differentiation and an\nincipient speciation process from another refugium. At the end of the\nIce Age, Central-Eastern Europe and Balkan lineages have spread out of\ntheir refuge area. Central-Eastern Europe and South Italy have met in a\nsecondary contact zone where our results suggest a reinforcement process\non local MMS patterns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"243","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64315","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64315.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"243","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64316","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64316.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"245","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64317","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64317.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"253","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64311","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64311.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"253","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64313","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64313.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"243","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64314","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64314.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"250","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64325","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64325.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"251","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64327.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"253","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64312","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64312.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"250","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64324","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64324.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"245","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64319.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"251","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64328.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64329","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64329.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"248","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64334.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64321.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64322.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"251","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64326","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64326.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64331","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64331.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"245","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64318.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64320","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64320.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"250","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64323.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64330.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"248","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64332","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64332.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"248","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64333","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64333.phy"}]}
