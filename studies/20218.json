Deliciosi are\ndescribed from montane central and southwestern China. Lactarius\nabieticola is associated with Abies trees. The pure orange basidiomata\nwith only faint greenish discoloration resemble L. laeticolor, L.\nsalmonicolor and L. thyinos, but the smaller size and whitish tomentum\nat the pileus margin make it different. Lactarius hengduanensis is\nsimilar to and closely related with L. deterrimus due to the orange\nlatex and association with Picea trees. The contrast between the vivid\norange stipe and paler lamellae and the spores with more reticulate\nornamentation can be used to separate it from L. deterrimus. Lactarius\npseudohatsudake has vinaceous red latex, similar to Asian L. hatsudake.\nThe symbiotic relationship with Picea trees and crowded lamellae are\ndifferences from L. hatsudake. Comparison and phylogenetic analysis on\nthe ITS sequences supported the three species to be distinct. The three\nnew species are representative ectomycorrhizal fungi in the\nsubalpine-alpine coniferous forests and putative choice edible mushrooms\nfor the local people.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99867.phy"}]}
