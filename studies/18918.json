Each of the disjunctions appears to have resulted from\nnorth-to-south dispersal since the mid-Miocene; three are associated\nwith such marked morphological and ecological change that some of the\nsouthern taxa (including Apostates) have been treated in distinct genera\nof uncertain relationship. Phyllotaxy within the Bahia alliance,\nhowever, evidently has been even more conservative evolutionarily than\nreflected by previous taxonomies, with alternate-leaved and\nopposite-leaved clades in Bahia sensu Ellison each encompassing\nrepresentatives of other genera that share the same leaf arrangements. A\nrevised taxonomic treatment of the Bahia alliance is proposed to\nrecognize morphologically distinctive, monophyletic genera, including\nthe critically endangered Apostates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bahia alliance cpDNA BI 95% consensus tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bahia alliance BI MCC tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93991.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bahia alliance BI 95% consensus tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fossil calibrated angiosperm 3-gene angiosperm\ntree","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fossil calibrated angiosperm 3-gene angiosperm\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93994.phy"}]}
