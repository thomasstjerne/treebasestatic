In order to\nreduce biodiversity loss, it is important to consider species’\ncontribution to evolutionary diversity along with their risk of\nextinction for the purpose of setting conservation priorities. Here I\nreconstruct the most comprehensive tree of life for the order\nScleractinia (1,293 species) that includes all 837 living reef species,\nand employ a composite measure of phylogenetic distinctiveness and\nextinction risk to identify the most endangered lineages that would not\nbe given top priority on the basis of risk alone. The preservation of\nthese lineages, not just the threatened species, is vital for\nsafeguarding evolutionary diversity. Tests for phylogeny-associated\npatterns show that corals facing elevated extinction risk are not\nclustered on the tree, but species that are susceptible, resistant or\nresilient to impacts such as bleaching and disease tend to be close\nrelatives. Intensification of these threats or extirpation of the\nendangered lineages could therefore result in disproportionate pruning\nof the coral tree of life.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"1295","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scleractinia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54534.phy"}]}
