Section Angelandra is synonymized with\nsection Heptallon, and the species from outside of North America that\nhad been placed into these two sections are shown to belong in other\nclades within the genus. As circumscribed here section Heptallon is a\nwell-supported clade of annual herbs and subshrubs that ranges from\ncentral Mexico to the eastern United States. A new combination, Croton\nheptalon, is made. Lectotypes are designated for C. corymbulosus, C.\nelliottii, C. ellipticus, C. engelmannii var. albinoides, C. eutrigynus,\nC. heptalon, and C. leucophyllus var. trisepalis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pilinophytum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pilinophytum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6311.phy"}]}
