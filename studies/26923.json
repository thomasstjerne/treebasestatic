Rare occurrences in the\neastern tropical Pacific have extended as far as 7° S off Peru. Using\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis of a newly collected specimen from the\nSalas y Gómez Ridge off Chile, we extend the known geographic range of\nP. meseres southward by 2040 km. This subtropical specimen showed higher\ngenetic similarity to a specimen from the type locality (<1.5%\npairwise COI distance) than to representatives from the Aleutian Islands\nand Japan (5-6%), establishing the first genetically confirmed\noccurrence of this species in the southern hemisphere. The latitudinal\nrange of P. meseres encompasses the sole collection locality, off\nEcuador, of Enigma terwielii Betrem, 1925, a pelagic annelid which has\nbeen compared to P. meseres, but is indeterminable due to an inadequate\ndescription. We therefore suggest that the earlier sole record of E.\nterwielii may have been an occurrence of what is known now as P.\nmeseres.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poeobius meseres","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130903.phy"}]}
