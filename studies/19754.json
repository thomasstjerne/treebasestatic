We sequenced nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer barcode\nregions for representatives of seven species and conducted phylogenetic\nanalyses, which provided strong support for four new species that we\ndescribe as Phyllachora cerradensis, P. ermidensis, P. furnasensis, and\nP. myrciariae. Catacauma nigerrimum was recombined into P. nigerrima,\nand a key to the common Phyllachora species on myrtaceous hosts from the\nBrazilian Cerrado was also included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllachora species on native Myrtacae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100000.phy"}]}
