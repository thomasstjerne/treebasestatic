Recently\nits teleomorph was detected and assigned to Hymenoscyphus albidus, which\nhas been known from Europe since 1851. Here we present molecular\nevidence for the existence of two morphologically very similar taxa, H.\nalbidus, which is lectotypified and Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus sp. nov.\nDifferences were found between the species in the loci calmodulin,\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (EF1-α) and the internal transcribed\nspacers of the rDNA genes (ITS), and strong differentiation was obtained\nwith ISSR markers. It is likely that H. albidus is a nonpathogenic\nspecies, whereas H. pseudoalbidus is a virulent species causing ash\ndieback. Genotyping herbarium specimens showed that H. pseudoalbidus has\nbeen present in Switzerland for at least 30 years prior to the outbreak\nof the epidemic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6891.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus, 3_loci_concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6912.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus, Calmodulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6741.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus, EF-1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6958.phy"}]}
