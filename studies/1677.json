The genus Apiognomonia was described based on A.\nveneta as the type species; however, there has been disagreement about\nwhether or not A. veneta is a synonym of A. errabunda. Using\nmorphological, ecological and DNA sequence data we conclude that A.\nerrabunda and A. veneta are different species, although very closely\nrelated, thus A. veneta is the correct name for the type species of\nApiognomonia. This conclusion is based on a combined analysis of\nsequences from the ITS region of the nuclear rDNA for 50 isolates from\nhost plants of eight different genera and intron regions from actin,\ncalmodulin and translation elongation factor 1-alpha for over 25\nisolates. Similarly, the type species of the genus Discula is D.\nnervisequa, the earliest available epithet for D. platani, the lectotype\nof Discula. Discula nervisequa is the anamorph of A. veneta. Based on an\nexamination of the type specimen, we determined that the commonly used\nname for the anamorph of A. errabunda, D. umbrinella, refers to another\nspecies. Therefore, a new combination, D. tiliae, is proposed for the\nanamorph of A. errabunda. Apiognomonia veneta and A. errabunda and their\nanamorphs are described and illustrated. An account of all synonyms and\nexcluded synonyms is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apiognomonia and its anamorph Discula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2635.phy"}]}
