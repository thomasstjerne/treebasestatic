Seventy species were selected for\ncladistic analyses and scored for 110 morphological characters; matK and\nITS molecular characters were obtained from GenBank for a subset of 26\ntaxa. Based on the preliminary results, Trillium rivale was used as a\nfunctional outgroup. For the subset of 26 species, analysis of the\ncombined ITS and matK sequence data produced six shortest trees; the\nmorphological data, 13 shortest trees; and the combined morphological\nand molecular data sets, three trees. Analyses of the full morphological\ndata set of 70 species produced 76 shortest trees. Trillium rivale was\ndistinct from both Paris and Trillium and should be placed in its own\ngenus, for which the name Pseudotrillium is proposed. Trillium\ngovanianum was more closely related to Paris than to Trillium but should\nbe retained as a monotypic genus, Trillidium. Trillium and Paris were\nmonophyletic based on molecular as well as morphological evidence. The\ncladistic analyses strongly support the separation of Paris sensu lato\ninto Daiswa, Kinugasa, and Paris. The monophyly of Trillium after\nremoval of Pseudotrillium and Trillidium was supported in all abut the\nlarge morphological analysis; subgenus Phyllantherum was monophyletic in\nall cases, but subgenus Trillium was not monophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK data with Veratrum maackii as outgroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_864.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strict consensus of six treed from the ITS-matK\nanalysis of Trilliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS data with Veratrum maackii as outgroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS data with Trillium rivale as outgroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_867.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1c","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK data with Trillium rivale as outgroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strict consensus of 13 trees from the small\nmorphological analysis of 26 species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_869.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strict consensus of 76 trees from the full\nmorphological analysis of 70 species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_870.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"More fully resolved Daiswa clade from large\nmorphological analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_871.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.6b","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"More fully resolved Phyllantherum clade from large\nmorphological analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_872.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strict consensus of three trees from the combined\nanalysis of Trilliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_873.phy"}]}
