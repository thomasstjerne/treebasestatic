The taxon is characterized by\na warm brown coloration, ovate, concave and muticous leaves with rounded\napices, ellipsoid capsules, constricted at mouth, the presence of\nstomata and a reduced, truncate peristome. Based on sequences of the ITS\nregion the new species is phylogenetically rather isolated, exhibiting\nthe closest relationship to S. agassizii which shares the muticous\nleaves but differs in having narrowly lingulate-lanceolate, almost flat\nleaves, cyathiform capsules and a perfect peristome. Schistidium\nforaminis-martini grows on moist calcareous rocks in the alpine and\nnival belt.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130609.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130608.phy"}]}
