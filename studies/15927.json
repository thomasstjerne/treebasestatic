Macropterous females associated\nfor several species have 2 pairs of broad bursa plates. Following an\nenlarged phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters, an expanded\ngeneric description of Pterop¬tyx Olivier now accommodates four new\nspecies with metafemoral combs. Three of these have an entire light\norgan in ventrite 7 but are without the generic hallmark of deflexed\nelytral apices in the male. The first species of Pteroptyx to pos¬sess\nthese features are Pt. sayangia Ballantyne sp. nov., Pt. galbina Jusoh\nsp. nov. and Pt. surabayia Ballantyne sp. nov. Based on a single unusual\nspecimen Pt. gombakia Ballantyne sp. nov. is here described with\ndeflexed elytral apices and bipartite light organ in ventrite 7, but\nwith exceptional incurving lobes along the posterior margin of ventrite\n7, which is a characteristic of Pyrophanes. The description of Luciola\ntestacea Motschulsky is discussed and many morphological characters of\nits type specimen are correctly outlined. Its place as the type for\nPteroptyx is addressed. Inflata gen. nov. Boontop is erected for\nspecimens of Luciola indica Motschulsky as Inflata indica (Motsch.)\ncomb. nov., and is described from males and reliably associated females.\nDiscussion overviews the present situation regarding Luciolinae taxonomy\nof southeast Asian and the Australopacific regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75381.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75380.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75382.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75383.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75384.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75385.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75386.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75387.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75388.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75389.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75390.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75391.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75392.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75393.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75394.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75395.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75396.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75397.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75398.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75399.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indo Pacific Luciolinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75400.phy"}]}
