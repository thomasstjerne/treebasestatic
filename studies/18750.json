It is characterized by thin,\ncinnamon-buff pore, resupinate basidiome with white subiculum, cottony\nmargin, clavate cystidia and oblong ellipsoid basidiospores measured as\n3.13.8 ´ 1.72 µm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) regions and nuclear large subunit (nLSU)\nribosomal RNA gene regions supported C. albomellea as a distinctive\nspecies belonging to Ceriporia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110247.phy"}]}
