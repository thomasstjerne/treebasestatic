We used a data set of nuclear ITS and\nLSU ribosomal DNA including 51 specimens to understand the influence of\nhistorical events on the current distribution patterns in the genus. We\nemployed Bayesian, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony approaches\nfor phylogenetic analyses, a likelihood-based approach to ancestral area\nreconstruction, and a Bayesian approach to estimate divergence times of\nmajor lineages within the genus. We identified two major clades in the\ngenus, one of them separating into two subclades and one of those into\nfour groups. Several of the groups and clades had restricted\ngeographical ranges in the southern Hemisphere, while two groups\nincluded species with wider distribution areas. Our analyses suggest\nthat the genus originated in southern South America during the\nEocene-Oligocene transition and that the diversification of the\nAustralasian groups happened recently. The subcosmopolitan distribution\nof species in groups 3 and 4 is explained by long-distance dispersal,\nwhile vicariance probably played a major role in the origin of the\ngenus. Several currently accepted species were found to be\nnon-monophyletic, indicating that the species delimitation in the genus\nrequires further studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichen forming fungal genus Flavoparmelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63498.phy"}]}
