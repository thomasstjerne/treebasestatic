These amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced.\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 5.8S gene sequences indicated that\nthe six clone sequences obtained were of different origins. Five\nsequences, P1-9, P2-6, P4-4, P4-5, and P4-7, belonged to the fungi and\none sequence, P3-2, belonged to the plants. P1-9 was inferred to belong\nto the Basidiomycota based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 5.8S gene\nsequences but could not be identified to lower taxonomic levels. Further\nidentification of the other four fungal clones to lower taxonomic levels\nwere conducted based on phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison of\nboth the conserved 5.8S gene and the variable ITS regions. The origin of\nP2-6 was identified to be Glomerella and its anamorph Colletotrichum;\nthe origins of P4-5 and P4-7 were Mycosphaerella and its anamorph\nCladosporium; while P4-4 was from the Herpotrichiellaceae. The direct\napproach to detecting and taxonomic placement of endophytic fungi within\nhost tissue without the need for conventional in vitro culturing is\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P2-6 (ITS2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P4-4 (5.8S, ITS1&2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3697.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"6 Clones (5.8S)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P2-6 (5.8S, ITS1&2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P2-6 (ITS1)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P4-5, P4-7 (5.8S, ITS1&2)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3698.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P1-9 (5.8S)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3699.phy"}]}
