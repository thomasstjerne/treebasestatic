Among Fungi, many mycocalicioid species are\nrather unique in having specialized to live on the resinous exudates of\nvascular plants. Terpenoid and phenolic resins essentially are\nrepellents for fungi, but some of these species even appear to use\nresins for their nutrition. This peculiar ecology has a long\nevolutionary history, judging from 20 to 40 Ma old amber fossils, in\nwhich the ascocarps growing on ancient resin bear remarkable resemblance\nto those of extant resinicolous species. In addition to resinicolous\nspecies, mycocalicioid fungi also include species that are saprotrophic\non lignum or associated with lichens or non-symbiotic algal\ncolonies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycocaliciales Ekologia kaikki ITS8 LSU8 mrb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61091.phy"}]}
