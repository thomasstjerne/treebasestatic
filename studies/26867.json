Two fungal\nstrains were proposed as a new species Pyrenochaetopsis kuksensis based\non morphology as well as phylogenetic analyses of ITS, LSU, rpb2, and\ntub2 sequence data. Detailed descriptions and phylogenetic relationships\nof the new taxon were provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenochaetopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134195.phy"}]}
