{"Authors":" Clive M.

Since the 1990s however disease\noutbreaks have occurred increasingly on ornamental C. lawsoniana in\nEurope; and in 2007 the pathogen was discovered in soil around old\ngrowth C. obtusa in Taiwan, where it may be endemic. When the phenotypes\nof over 150 isolates of P. lateralis from Taiwan, across the Pacific\nNorthwest (British Columbia to California) and from France, the\nNetherlands and the UK were compared three growth rate groups were\nresolved: one slow growing from Taiwan, one fast growing from the\nPacific Northwest and Europe and one of intermediate growth from a small\narea of the UK. Within these growth groups distinct subtypes were\nidentified based on colony patterns and spore metrics and further\ndiscriminated in a multivariate analysis. The assumption that the three\nmain growth groups represented phylogenetic units was tested by\ncomparative sequencing of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes.\nThis assumption was confirmed. In addition two phenotype clusters within\nthe Taiwan growth group were also shown to be phylogenetically distinct.\nThese four phenotypically and genotypically unique populations are\ninformally labeled the Pacific Northwest lineage, the UK lineage, the\nTaiwan J lineage and the Taiwan K lineage. Their characteristics and\ndistribution are described and their evolution, taxonomic and plant\nhealth significance is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
