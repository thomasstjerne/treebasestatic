Conidiobolus dabieshanensis is confirmed as a new\nspecies with chlamydospores within the genus Conidiobolus based on the\nmorphological evidence and the molecular data of LSU rDNA region. It is\nmorphologically allied with C. adiaeretus and C. firmipilleus and it is\nphylogenetically closely related to C. humicolus, C. chlamydosporus and\nC. firmipilleus. The new species differs from C. adiaeretus by the\nabsence of capilliconidia, from C. firmipilleus and C. chlamydosporus by\nits size of primary conidia and slender and curving germ hyphae arising\nfrom a single conidium, and from C. humicolus by its larger primary\nconidia and the absence of zygospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidiobolus with chlamydospore from Dabie\nMountain","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101624.phy"}]}
