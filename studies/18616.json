A comparative study of\nthe types and reference material, as well as phylogenetic analysis, led\nus to conclude that these specimens represent an undescribed species,\npresented here as Amauroderma calcitum. In addition A. brasiliense is\npresented as a new record for the Brazilian Cerrado. Illustrations,\ntaxonomic analyses and a discussion are presented for each taxon, and a\nkey to the Amauroderma species from Brazil is provided. A phylogenetic\ndiscussion about the genus is also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amauroderma ITS MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92290.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amauroderma ITS+LSU MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92291.phy"}]}
