In\naddition, a multilocus phylogeny analysis based on nuclear ITS and\n√ü-tubulin and mitochondrial cox1 sequences, as well as\nmicromorphological features, supported the description of a new species\nbelonging to the phylogenetic clade 7c, Phytophthora mediterranea sp.\nnov. Phytophthora mediterranea was shown to be associated with collar\nand root rot symptoms on myrtle seedlings. Phylogenetically, P.\nmediterranea is closely related to P. cinnamomi but the two species\ndiffer in 87 nucleotides in the three studied DNA regions.\nMorphologically P. mediterranea can be easily distinguished from P.\ncinnamomi on the basis of its smaller sporangia, colony growth pattern\nand higher optimum and maximum temperature values. Data from the\npathogenicity test showed that P. mediterranea has the potential to\nthreaten the native Mediterranean maquis vegetation. Finally, the\ndiscovery of P. cinnamomi in alpine nurseries, confirms the progressive\nexpansion of this species towards cold environments, probably driven by\nclimate change.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134087.phy"}]}
