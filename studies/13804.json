This\nnew taxon is described as P. kongii sp. nov., which belongs to subgenus\nPenicillium sect. Brevicompacta and is morphologically similar to P.\nbialowiezense and P. brevicompactum. Phylogenetic analyses on the basis\nof sequence data using parts of calmodulin gene, Î²-tubulin gene and\nrDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 showed that it represented a phylogenetically\ndistinctive clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.S2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62078","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62079","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.S1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62080","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62080.phy"}]}
