In this study, we reconstruct the first\nmolecular higher-level phylogeny for the species-rich darkling beetles,\na family comprising at least 20,000 species. Although amongst all\nfamilies of beetles the family ranks seventh in terms of species\nrichness, the lack of knowledge on the phylogeny and systematics of the\ngroup is such that its monophyly is questioned (not to mention those of\nthe subfamilies and tribes). We investigate the evolutionary history of\nTenebrionidae using multiple phylogenetic inference methods (Bayesian\ninference, maximum likelihood and parsimony) to analyse a dataset\nconsisting of eight gene fragments across 404-taxa (including 250\ntenebrionid species). Although the resulting phylogenetic framework only\nencompasses a fraction of the known tenebrionid diversity, it provides\nimportant information on their systematics and evolution. Whatever the\nmethods used, our results provide a strong support for the monophyly of\nthe family, and highlight the likely paraphyletic or polyphyletic nature\nof several important tenebrionid subfamilies and tribes. It is\nespecially the case for the polyphyletic subfamilies Diaperinae and\nTenebrioninae, which clearly require substantial revision in the future.\nSome unexpected associations in several higher groups are also evidenced\nby the phylogenetic analyses, such as the pairing of Opatrini with\nBolitophagini. Our study also advances our knowledge of the evolution of\nthe group, providing novel insights to discuss much-debated theories,\nsuch as the apparent relict distribution of the tribe Elenophorini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Yule16UniCrown","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65485","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65485.phy"},{"tree_label":"Yule21UniCrown","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65486","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65486.phy"},{"tree_label":"Yule16UniStem","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65487","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65487.phy"},{"tree_label":"Yule21UniStem","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65488.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT1","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65478","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65478.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT2","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65479","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65479.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65480","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65480.phy"},{"tree_label":"BD16UniCrown","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65481","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65481.phy"},{"tree_label":"BD21UniCrown","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65482","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65482.phy"},{"tree_label":"BD16UniStem","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65483","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65483.phy"},{"tree_label":"BD21Unistem","ntax":"404","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65484","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65484.phy"}]}
