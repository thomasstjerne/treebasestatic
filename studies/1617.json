Conidial ontogeny was thoroughly studied\nand illustrated both with light and scanning electron microscopy, which\nrevealed a unique conidial morphology. Analysis of partial nuLSU rDNA\nand ITS data revealed a phylogenetic position within the Xylariales\n(Ascomycota), but family affiliation remained unclear.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyancora globosa gen. et sp. nov., MP strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_730.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyancora globosa gen. et sp. nov., PhyML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyancora globosa gen. et sp. nov., MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_732.phy"}]}
