The\npaucity of molecular data and unclear connection of sexual and asexual\nmorphs make it difficult to resolve taxa within this order. In the\npresent study, Patellariopsidaceae fam. nov., the asexual morph of\nPatellariopsis atrovinosa and a new record of Cheirospora botryospora\n(Vibrissiaceae) on Fagus sylvatica (Fagaceae) from Italy are introduced\nbased on morphology and molecular phylogeny. For the phylogenetic\nanalyses, the combined large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and ITS gene\nsequence data, were used separately to improve resolution in the\npolyphyletic Helotiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119300.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123405","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123405.phy"}]}
