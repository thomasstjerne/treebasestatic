Current discussions focus on three competing\nhypotheses: a monophyletic origin within either Temnospondyli or\nLepospondyli, or a polyphyletic origin with frogs and salamanders\narising among temnospondyls and caecilians among the lepospondyls.\nRecent molecular analyses are also controversial, with estimations for\nthe batrachian (frog salamander) divergence significantly older than the\npalaeontolo- gical evidence supports. Here we report the discovery of an\namphibamid temnospondyl from the Early Permian of Texas that bridges the\ngap between other Palaeozoic amphibians and the earliest known\nsalientians and caudatans from the Mesozoic. The presence of a mosaic of\nsalientian and caudatan characters in this small fossil makes it a key\ntaxon close to the batrachian (frog and salamander) divergence.\nPhylogenetic analysis suggests that the batrachian divergence occurred\nin the Middle Permian, rather than the late Carboniferous as recently\nestimated using molecular clocks, but the divergence with caecilians\ncorresponds to the deep split between temnospondyls and lepospondyls,\nwhich is congruent with the molecular estimates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of Frogs and Salamanders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48896.phy"}]}
