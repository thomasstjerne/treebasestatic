The\nnew species were recognized by molecular phylogenetic analyses of the\nDNA sequences. The ex-type of M. bibionidae sp. nov. was isolated from a\nlarva of a march fly. This species was placed in the phylogeny as sister\nspecies of M. pemphigi in the M. flavoviride species complex. The\nconidia of this species were longer than those of M. pemphigi, which\nsupported the genetic independency of the two species. M. roseum sp.\nnov. was isolated from soil by both plating method and bait method with\ntermites. The DNA sequence of this species was quite differentiated from\nany known species of Metarhizium. Three isolates identified as this\nspecies selectively produced red pigment when they were co-cultured with\nthe other fungal species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"4loci MLtre","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101440.phy"},{"tree_label":"5TEF Bayes50contre","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101439.phy"},{"tree_label":"5TEF MLtre","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101438","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101438.phy"},{"tree_label":"4loci Bayes50contre","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101441","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101441.phy"}]}
