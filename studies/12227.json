Here we present a reviewed phylogenetic\nanalysis of scytodoid spiders, emphasizing in Periegops, the only genus\nin the family Periegopidae. In our analysis the Scytodoidea are united\nby the fusion of the third abdominal entapophyses into a median lobe,\nthe presence of female palpal femoral thorns and cheliceral stridulatory\nridges, a membranous lobe on the cheliceral promargin, and the loss of\nminor ampullate gland spigots. A basal split within Scytodoidea defines\ntwo monophyletic groups: Sicariidae and a group formed by Scytodidae as\nthe sister group of Periegopidae plus Drymusidae, all united by having\nbipectinate prolateral claws on tarsi IÂ–II, one major ampullate spigot\naccompanied by a nubbin, and the posterior median spinnerets with a\nmesal field of spicules. Periegops is the sister group of Drymusidae,\nunited by the regain of promarginal cheliceral teeth and a triangular\ncheliceral lamina, which is continuous with the paturon margin.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Periegops and the phylogeny of Scytodoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50260.phy"}]}
