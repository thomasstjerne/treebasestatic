In\norder to expand the knowledge about this group, we collected samples in\nAtlantic forest, in South and Northeast Brazil. Molecular phylogenetic\nand morphological analyses were performed. We found two lineages with\nunique morphotypes. They were recovered high supported as sister lineage\nclosely related to M. clelandii and M. subcitrophylla. Therefore the two\nnew species are described, M. cyanolamellata and M. potiguar, from\ntropical and subtropical regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"comb con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107540","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107540.phy"},{"tree_label":"combMLtree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107541","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107541.phy"},{"tree_label":"itsMLtree 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107538.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITScon 50 majrule","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107539","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107539.phy"}]}
