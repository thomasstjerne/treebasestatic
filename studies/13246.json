This\nspecimen possesses several derived character states that are typically\nobserved in advanced diplodocoids or diplodocids, including the\nfollowing: a mildly procoelous centrum; a deep pit-like pneumatic fossa\nimmediately below the caudal rib; wing- or fan-shaped caudal ribs; and\ncomplex lamination of the neural spine. The neural spine is\napomorphically short and the centrum is short relative to its height\ncompared to those of other diplodocids, which, when coupled with the\nspecimens unique","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5B","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56008.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 5A","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56007.phy"}]}
