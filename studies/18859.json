In this paper, we introduce P. pandanicola sp. nov.,\nwith an illustrated account. Evidence for the new species is provided by\na distinct morphology and phylogenetic analysis. This is also the first\nreport of the sexual morph of Parasarcopodium. The phylogenetic trees\nused maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian analyses of combined LSU,\nSSU, TEF and RPB2 sequence data to show the placement of the new species\nin Stachybotryaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101548","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101548.phy"}]}
