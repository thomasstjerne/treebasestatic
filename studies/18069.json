The aim of this\nstudy was to identify and characterize the pathogen. Isolation from tea\nshowing canker symptoms consistently yielded Fusaria and a total of 96\nisolates was obtained. Randomly selected 13 isolates were used for\nmolecular and morphological characterization. ITS and TEF combined\nsequences analysis identified the pathogen as members of Fusarium solani\nspecies complex (FSSC) clade 3. Eight of the 13 isolates grouped within\nthe Ambrosia Fusarium clade B (AFC). Growth characterization and\npathogenicity tests were performed with representative isolates N11, R5,\nY8 and Y26. Artificial inoculation on one year and 10 year old plants\nwith the selected isolates resulted in cankers thus showing the ability\nof the isolates to infect young and mature tea bushes. The optimum\ntemperature for growth and sporulation of the isolates was 26-30Â°C and\npH 5.5. The findings of the study will help to develop intervention\nstrategies and reduce the economic impact of this recently emerged\ndisease of tea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89429.phy"}]}
