If losses were not randomly distributed across the tree of\nlife, climate change could lead to a disproportionate loss of\nevolutionary history. Here we estimate the consequences of climate\nchange on the phylogenetic diversities of plant, bird and mammal\nassemblages across Europe. Using a consensus across ensembles of\nforecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 and high-resolution phylogenetic\ntrees, we show that species vulnerability to climate change clusters\nweakly across phylogenies. Such phylogenetic signal in species\nvulnerabilities does not lead to higher loss of evolutionary history\nthan expected with a model of random extinctions. This is because\nvulnerable species have neither fewer nor closer relatives than the\nremaining clades. Reductions in phylogenetic diversity will be greater\nin southern Europe, and gains are expected in regions of high latitude\nor altitude. However, losses will not be offset by gains and the tree of\nlife faces a trend towards homogenization across the continent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Atlas Flora Europaea","ntax":"378","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20842","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20842.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"431","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr29841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_29841.phy"}]}
