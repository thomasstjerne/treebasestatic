Stromata characteristic\nof Epichloë spp. were present on some of the reproductive tillers of\nindividual host grasses. Only 3 of the 98 stromata observed on field\nplants became orange and produced perithecia. Phylogenetic analyses\nbased on sequences of tubB and tefA indicated that this Epichloë sp. was\nan interspecific hybrid related to both E. yangzii and members in the E.\ntyphina complex clade (ETC). The allele-1 of tefA and tubB grouped in\nthe E. bromicola/E. yangzii clade; the allele-2 of these two genes\nclustered in a distinct sub-clade in the ETC. It is the first report of\nan Epichloë species that has interspecific hybrid origins. We propose\nthe name Epichloë liyangensis Z. Wang, Y. Kang et H. Miao, sp. nov. for\nthis new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tefA","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25601.phy"},{"tree_label":"tubB nj","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25602","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25602.phy"}]}
