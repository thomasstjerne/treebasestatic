P.\npseudotephropora is characterized by perennial and pileate basidiocarps\nwith distinctly stratified tubes; a dimitic hyphal system with slightly\ndextrinoid arboriform skeletal hyphae; globose, truncate, weakly\ndextrinoid, cyanophilous basidiospores measuring 4.95.2 × 44.8 μm. P.\nsubcorticola is characterized resupinate basidiocarps, yellow pores with\nthick dissepiments, tissues becoming dark in KOH, flexuous skeletal\nhyphae, ellipsoid, truncate and slightly dextrinoid basidiospores\nmeasuring 4.25 × 3.54.2 µm. In addition, P. corticola is\nphylogenetically analyzed, and compared with relative species. The\nmorphological similar species and phylogenetically closely related\nspecies to the two new species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perenniporia ITS LSU MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125655.phy"}]}
