In Brazil, the\ncausal agent is the fungus Thielaviopsis paradoxa. However, recent\nstudies proved that T. paradoxa is a complex species composed of five\nphylogenetic species. In this work, four Thielaviopsis strains obtained\nfrom sugarcane stems and pineapple fruits were characterized using\nmolecular and morphological approaches. Primary and secondary conidia\nwere observed by bright field microscopic analysis. In the sexual\ncompatibility test, black perithecia with ascospore mass exudation at\nthe stem-neck were observed. According to phylogenetic analysis with ITS\nand TEF1-α sequences, the strains were identified as T. ethacetica.\nInoculation test in sugarcane resulted in stem rot and in germination\nand sprouting reduction. This is the first record of sugarcane stem rot\ncaused by T. ethacetica in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113433","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113433.phy"}]}
