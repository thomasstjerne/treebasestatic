We collected fifteen B. edulis\nbasidiomata samples from locations in Japan and identified them\nmicroscopically and by phylogenetic analysis of their rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) regions. Pure culture isolates of B. edulis\nwere established efficiently on malt extract agar (MA) medium, and one\nisolate, EN-63, was inoculated to axenic Pinus densiflora (pine)\nseedlings in vitro. Brownish ectomycorrhizal tips were observed on the\npine lateral roots within four months of inoculation. Ten pine seedlings\nthat formed ectomycorrhizae were acclimatized under laboratory and\ngreenhouse conditions. At 4 months after transplant, mycorrhizal\ncolonization by B. edulis was observed on newly grown root tips under\nlaboratory conditions, but no B. edulis ectomycorrhiza survived under\ngreenhouse conditions. These results suggest that B. edulis\nectomycorrhizae synthesized in vitro with P. densiflora requires\nadditional steps for acclimatization to greenhouse conditions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64797","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64797.phy"}]}
