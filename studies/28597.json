The leaves\nare very appreciated in cooking in some Brazilian regions, specially\nMinas Gerais. Plants of P. aculeata showing severe leaf spot diseases\nend stem rot were observed in in Viçosa, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.\nColletotrichum sp. were observed associated with the anthracnose disease\nand since no records of this fungus (and anthracnose disease) is\nreported for this host, the present study has aimed to identify the\nColletotrichum sp. associated to P. aculeata and elucidate the etiology\nof the anthracnose disease. Based on morphological characters combined\nwith phylogenetic data from ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT and TUB2, a new\nspecies, namelly Colletotrichum pereskiae sp. nov., is proposed\nbelonging to the C. orchidearum complex. A representative isolate was\ninoculated on healthy P. aculeata plants and reproduced the severe\nsymptoms observed in the field. Colletotrichum pereskiae is the\netiological agent of anthracnose on Pereskia aculeata in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132593.phy"}]}
