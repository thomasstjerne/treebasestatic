Morphologically, it is distinctive in the\nfollowing combined characters: the fibrillose pileus, shallow and sparse\nlamellae with pink or purplish discoloration when bruised and basidia\nand pileipellis with brown intracellular pigment. Phylogenetic analyses\ninferred from ITS sequences also suggest that it is a distinct taxon\nnerghbouring H. caespitosa, H. griseobrunnea and H. melleofusca.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75495.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75496.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75497","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75497.phy"}]}
