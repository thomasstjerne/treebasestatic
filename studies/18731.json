Comprehensive descriptions of these species\nare provided along with photo-illustrations and comparisons with\nphenetically similar and phylogenetically related species. Nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) of the three species\nwere sequenced and analyzed. In addition, nuclear ribosomal large\nsubunit (nLSU) gene of Calocybella swetha was sequenced and used in\nBLASTn search to find similar sequences. ITS-based phylogenetic analysis\nusing Maximum likelihood (ML) method supported both the novelty of these\nspecies and their placement within the genus. The discovery of these\nthree species forms the first record of Calocybella outside Europe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calocybella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97449.phy"}]}
