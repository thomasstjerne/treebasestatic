Deliciosi is a group of edible mushrooms\nwith a worldwide geographical distribution. Several species are\nconsidered choice edible mushrooms. Taxonomic knowledge on this group in\nAsia is still fragmentary. A new species with orange latex, L. vividus,\nis described in this section. It is an important wild edible mushroom,\nwidely distributed in central and southern China, but for a long time it\nwas either not distinguished from its lookalikes or left unnamed or\nmisidentified. Morphological analyses demonstrate that this species\nencompasses high infra-specific morphological variation, which makes it\nhard to clearly delimit its boundaries. Compared with the other species\nhaving orange latex in the same section, this species can be mostly\nrecognized by the vividly colored, sub-distant to distant lamellae and\nheavy spore ornamentation. It has been found to grow with four pine\ntrees of Pinus subg. Pinus including P. latteri, P. massoniana, P.\ntaiwanensis and P. thunbergii. Phylogenetic analyses on ITS regions and\nglyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase gene sequences support the\nspecies delimitation and suggest the two genes to be good markers to\nidentify this new species readily.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gpd-ML-tree","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius vividus sp. nov. gpd","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_104248.phy"}]}
