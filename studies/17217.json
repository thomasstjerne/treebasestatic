It\nincludes three genera, Meliosma, Ophiocaryon and Sabia, the first being\nmost species-rich and the only one found throughout the entire disjunct\ndistribution range displayed by the family at present time. Sabiaceae\nresolves among early-diverging eudicots in family-level phylogenetic\nstudies, however, to date, no such studies have focused on the family or\nany of its members. Nuclear and chloroplast molecular data were used to\ninfer phylogenetic relationships within Sabiaceae and Meliosma. Sabia\noccupies a basal position in Sabiaceae and Ophiocaryon is nested in\nMeliosma, though the monophyly of the latter cannot be rejected. Results\nshow that Meliosma alba, found in China and Mexico, is monophyletic. The\nsubgeneric classification of Meliosma, largely based on endocarp\nmorphological characters, is evaluated in light of the obtained results.\nFindings suggest that the intricate floral morphology of Meliosma is\nderived within Sabiaceae and that the basic floral plan in the family is\npentamerous. Results could have taxonomic implications for Meliosma alba\nif confirmed by future research.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sabiaceae rbcL, trnL-F, psbA-trnH, rpl32-trnL and\nnrITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86692.phy"}]}
