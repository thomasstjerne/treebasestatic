The main aim of the study is to provide\na database of this group of fungi for supporting the identification\nwhich is still difficult for many mycologists and plant pathologists in\nthis region. Mycosphaerella guttulata sp. nov., found on Platycerium\nwallichii, is proposed as a new species in this report as this fungus is\ndistinct from other Mycosphaerella species by having guttulate and pale\nbrown spores. Phylogenetic examination of internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA indicated an anamorph-teleomorph\nconnection with the genus Pseudocercospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Transformed from PAUP_1943","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43258.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRul con of 6289","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43257.phy"}]}
