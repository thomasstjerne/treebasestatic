Previous molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses identified three well-delimited lineages that represent F.\nmounceae and F. ochracea from Canada, Appalachian Mountains, and\nnorthern USA and F. schrenkii from western and southwestern USA.\nFomitopsis pinicola sensu stricto is restricted to Eurasia and does not\noccur in North America. Morphological descriptions of basidiocarps and\ncultures for F. mounceae, F. schrenkii, and F. ochracea are presented.\nThe three species are readily differentiated by ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS)\nsequences, geographic distribution, and basidiospore size. Polyporus\nponderosus H. Schrenk is an earlier illegitimate synonym of F.\nschrenkii. Both F. mounceae and F. schrenkii have a heterothallic,\nmulti-allelic incompatibility system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitopsis Coalescent","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115622.phy"}]}
