Although their synthesis has been documented in laboratory\nculture, it remains uncertain whether these compounds are actually\nproduced under field conditions. Here, we report the presence and\nexpression of fungal type I PKS genes in the organic horizon of a forest\nsoil. If these expressed PKS genes produce compounds that elicit\nantagonistic interactions among soil microorganisms, then it could be a\nfactor structuring microbial communities in soil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacterial and Fungal PKS Genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6594.phy"}]}
