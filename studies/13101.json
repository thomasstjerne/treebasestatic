However,\nlittle is known about their rise and diversification prior to the Late\nCretaceous. Furthermore, the evolution of their highly-modified skull\nanatomy has been largely hindered by the scarcity of well-preserved\ncranial remains. A new sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of\nBrazil represents the earliest advanced titanosaurian known to date,\ndemonstrating that the initial diversification of advanced\ntitanosaurians was well under way at least 30 million years before their\nknown radiation in the latest Cretaceous. The new taxon also preserves\nthe most complete skull among titanosaurians, further revealing that\ntheir low and elongated diplodocid-like skull morphology appeared much\nearlier than previously thought.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurosauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55510.phy"}]}
