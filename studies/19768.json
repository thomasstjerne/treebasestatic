While surveying Pseudopestalotiopsis\nin Vietnam during 2013 and in Myanmar during 2015, we found 19 stains,\nincluding two novel Pseudopestalotiopsis species, based on morphological\nand phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer, β-tubulin, and\ntef1 gene region data sets. These new species were named\nPseudopestalotiopsis myanmarina and Ps. vietnamensis. Among 13 strains\nidentified as Ps. myanmarina, seven produced sexual morphs with similar\nmorphological characteristics to “Pestalosphaeria”, indicating that\nsexual morphs of Pseudopestalotiopsis and Pestalotiopsis are common.\nAmong the asexual morphs, two strains of Pseudopestalotiopsis had\nconidia with three pale-pigmented median cells, which is the same\ncharacter found in Pestalotiopsis. In this study, we distinguished\nPseudopestalotiopsis based on molecular analyses, whereas the results\nwere unclear according to the morphological analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100265","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100265.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100266","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100266.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100264.phy"}]}
