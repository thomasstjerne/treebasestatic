Although the genus was originally described from Europe,\nseveral of the subsequently described species of Calocybella are from\ntropical India. Here, we present an account of all Calocybella species\nknown from India including a species new to science, C. dicholamellata\nK.P.D.Latha, K.N.A.Raj & Manim., sp. nov., based on morphology\ncoupled with molecular phylogenetic analyses. The Maximum Likelihood\n(ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses based on nrITS sequence\ndataset unequivocally placed C. dicholamellata, sp. nov., within the\ngenus Calocybella. A comprehensive description, photographs of the\nbasidiocarps in their natural habitat and of the microscopic structures,\ncomparisons with phenetically and phylogenetically related species, and\na phylogram to show the placement of the new species are provided. The\ndiagnostic features and photographs of the other species of Calocybella\nfrom this region and a table providing a comparison of all known species\nof Calocybella also are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123920.phy"}]}
