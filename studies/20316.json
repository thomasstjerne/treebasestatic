The PIN gene family is an essential auxin polar\ntransport protein, but little research on soybean PINs (GmPINs) has been\ndone, especially with respect to evolution and the differences between\nwild and cultivated soybean. In this study, we retrieved 23 GmPINs from\nthe latest updated G. max genome database; six GmPINs protein sequences\nwere changed compared with the previous database. Based on the Plant\nGenome Duplication Database, 18 GmPINs have been involved in segment\nduplication. Three pairs of GmPINs arose after the second soybean genome\nduplication, and six occurred after the first genome duplication. The\nduplicated GmPINs retained similar expression patterns. All the\nduplicated GmPINs experienced purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 1) to\nremove alleles that were deleterious and so became more similar. In\naddition, we also focused on the differences in the soybean PIN genes.\nFive artificially selected GmPINs were identified by comparing the\ngenome sequence of 17 wild and 14 cultivated soybean varieties. Our\nresearch provides useful and comprehensive basic information for\nunderstanding GmPINs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100521.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100520.phy"}]}
