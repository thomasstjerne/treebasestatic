As part of a\nCitizen Science Project initiated by the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity\nInstitute and the Utrecht University Museum, which aimed to describe\nnovel fungal species from Dutch garden soil, the diversity of fusarioid\nfungi (Fusarium and other fusarioid genera), which are members of\nNectriaceae (Hypocreales) was investigated. Preliminary analyses of ITS\nand LSU sequences from more than 4 750 isolates obtained indicated that\n109 strains belong to this generic complex. Based on multi-locus\nphylogenies of combinations of cmdA, tef1, rpb1, rpb2 and tub2\nalignments, and morphological characteristics, 25 species were\nidentified, namely 22 in Fusarium and three in Neocosmospora.\nFurthermore, two species were described as new namely F. vanleeuwenii\nfrom the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC), and F.\nwereldwijsianum from the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex\n(FIESC). Other species encountered in this study include in the FOSC: F.\ncurvatum, F. nirenbergiae, F. oxysporum and three undescribed Fusarium\nspp.; in the FIESC: F. clavus, F. croceum, F. equiseti, F. flagelliforme\nand F. toxicum; Fusarium tricinctum species complex: F. flocciferum and\nF. torulosum; the Fusarium sambucinum species complex: F. culmorum and\nF. graminearum; the Fusarium redolens species complex: F. redolens; and\nthe Fusarium fujikuroi species complex: F. verticillioides. Three\nspecies of Neocosmospora were encountered, namely N. solani, N.\nstercicola and N. tonkinensis. Although soil fungal diversity has been\nwell studied in the Netherlands, this study revealed two new species,\nand eight new records: F. clavus, F. croceum, F. flagelliforme, F.\nodoratissimum, F. tardicrescens, F. toxicum, F. triseptatum and N.\nstercicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished multi-locus MrBayes phylogeny of the\nFusarium oxysporum species complex","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132935.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes using RPB2 (second\npart)","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132916.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes using calmodulin","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132913.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes using translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132917.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes using RPB1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132914","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium sambucinum species complex using RPB1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132944","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132944.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished single locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes using RPB2 (first\npart)","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished multi-locus IQ-TREE phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished multi-locus MrBayes phylogeny of the\nFusarium citricola/trincinctum species complexes","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.
