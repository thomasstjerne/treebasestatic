All the analyses strongly support Diadocidiidae as a\nmonophyletic group. Genus Diadocidia Ruthe, 1831 includes monophyletic\nsubgenera Diadocidia s. str. and Taidocidia Papp & Å evÄÃ­k, 2005.\nThe monophyly of Adidocidia LaÅ¡tovka & Matile, 1972 was not\nconfirmed. The position of Diadocidiidae and relationships of the\nfamilies within the infraorder Bibionomorpha is demonstrated in the\nanalyses based on three gene markers (28S, 12S and 16S). The Bayesian\nand maximum likelihood analyses of 12 families of Bibionomorpha revealed\nSciaridae as the closest relative of Diadocidiidae. Most of the\ncurrently recognized extant families of Bibionomorpha proved to be\nmonophyletic. The family Keroplatidae revealed as paraphyletic, with the\ngenera of Macrocerinae being more related to Cecidomyiidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MLT with Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diadocidiidae MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MLT without Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72563.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI without Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72564.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI without Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72565.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI with Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72569.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI with Nepaletricha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72570.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diadocidiidae BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72556.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diadocidiidae BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72557.phy"}]}
