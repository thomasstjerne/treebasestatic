A\ndiseases causing stem girdling and cutting dieback in eucalyptus\nassociated with Pestalotiopsis like fungi has been detected in nurseries\nand young plantations in the last years. Twenty-two isolates were\nrecovered from diseased seedlings in nurseries and from young plants in\nthe field. Phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed spacers,\npartial translation elongation factor 1-α gene and partial β-tubulin\ngene sequence data grouped the isolates in five separate clades.\nCombining morphological, cultural, and molecular data, five new species\nof Neopestalotiopsis are described, Neopestalotiopsis eucalyptorum,\nNeopestalotiopsis hispanica, Neopestalotiopsis iberica,\nNeopestalotiopsis longiappendiculata and Neopestalotiopsis\nlusitanica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129997","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129997.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129998","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129998.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129996","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129996.phy"}]}
