In contrast to previous studies, Celastrales and\nMalpighiales are resolved as being more closely related to one another\nthan either are to Oxalidales. The Huaceae are well supported as the\nsister group to Oxalidales, not Celastrales, as had been previously\nproposed. The Lepidobotryaceae are unambiguously supported as sister to\nthe clade consisting of Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. The\nParnassiaceae are well supported as members of an early branching\nlineage within Celastraceae, rather than as its sister group. Likewise,\nPottingeria appears to be part of an early derived lineage within\nCelastraceae. Empleuridium is unambiguously supported as a derived\nmember of Celastraceae, as are Brexia, Canotia, Siphonodon, Stackhousia,\nand Tripterococcus. Bhesa is unambiguously supported as a member of the\nMalpighiales, though its relationships within the order remain unclear.\nPerrottetia should be transferred out of Celastraceae and into eurosids\nII, being closely related to Tapiscia and Dipentodon. These results help\ndelimit the Celastrales and Celastraceae as morphologically more\nhomogeneous taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S6_rbcL Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2276.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5_matK Strict","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2277.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4_atpB Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2278.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1_simul Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2274.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S7_trnL-F Strict","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2275.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3_26S Strict","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2279.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2_ITS1 Strict","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2280.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1_18S Strict","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celastrales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2281.phy"}]}
