A new species, Peziza olivia (Pezizaceae, Peziza sensu\nstricto) is described from stream habitats in the Oregon Cascade\nMountains (USA). This new ascomycete grows underwater on sticks and\ndecomposing wood, and also near to running water, where the woody\nsubstrate is functionally saturated. This report continues a pattern of\ndocumenting new diversity in high quality forest habitats, and provides\ndata toward monitoring and maintaining these habitats through adaptive\nmanagement methods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64447.phy"}]}
