Discovered in 2012, it is a rare species known only\nfrom a single locality in the Kaokoveld Centre of Plant Endemism,\nnorth-western Namibia. Phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequence data\nfrom the plastid matK gene resolves Oberholzeria as the sister group to\nthe Genisteae clade while data from the nuclear rDNA ITS region showed\nthat it is sister to a clade comprising both the Crotalarieae and\nGenisteae clades. Morphological characters diagnostic of the new genus\ninclude: 1) succulent stems with woody remains; 2) pinnately\ntrifoliolate, fleshy leaves; 3) monadelphous stamens in a sheath that is\nfused above; 4) dimorphic anthers with five long, basifixed anthers\nalternating with five short, dorsifixed anthers, and 5) pendent,\nmembranous, one-seeded, laterally flattened, slightly inflated but\nindehiscent fruits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80014","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80014.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80013","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80013.phy"}]}
