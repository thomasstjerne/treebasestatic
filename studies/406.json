Fusarium\npseudograminearum can be distinguished from F. graminearum based on\ndifference in colony growth rates, region of conidia with greatest\nwidth, different reactions to black-light-blue light concerning the\nlength of 3- and 5-septate conidia, and absence of homothallic\nproduction of perithecia. Maximum parsimony analysis of DNA sequences\nfrom the beta-tubulin gene introns and exons indicate that F.\npseudograminearum represents a phylogenetically distinct species that is\na sister group to a F. graminearum-F. lunulosporum-F. culmorum clade.\nDNA sequence data from the translation elongation factor (EF-1 alpha)\ngene were used to develop a polymerase chain reaction primer pair which\nspecifically amplified DNA from all isolates of Fusarium\npseudograminearum tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 26","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3381.phy"}]}
