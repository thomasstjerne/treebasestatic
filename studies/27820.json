Mangrove wood were collected from the\nReserva Ecológica Manglares Churute, subsequently incubated to obtain\nthe reproduction structures (ascospores). These ascospores were\ninoculated in standard culture media (PDA, PYG, and YMA). Once the\nmonosporic isolates were obtained, the DNA extraction was performed, and\nthree molecular markers corresponding to the loci ITS, LSU, and TEF1-,\nwere used. Molecular identification using the three DNA markers\nsupported morphological identification, demonstrating that the\nmorphologically identified isolate corresponded to Verruculina enalia.\nThe LSU and ITS revealed the best results for species identification by\nobtaining DNA similarity percentages of 100%. Phylogenetic analyses with\nsequences queried in the GenBank supported species identification for\nthe three loci analysed. Finally, the three markers used suggest a\nhigh-resolution power for the molecular characterization of manglicolous\nmarine ascomycetes, combining molecular identification with previous\nmorphological identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis for Verruculina enalia from\nEcuador based on the ITS alignment with accessions reported in the\nGenBank.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129214.phy"}]}
