Comparative morphological studies of these populations with\nthe type collections of F. peruviana, F. herzogii, F. ptychophylla, and\nF. australis, and a phylogenetic analysis of three chloroplast loci in\n18 morphologically defined species of the genus were conducted to\ndetermine the taxonomic status of these populations. Both studies\nsupport the recognition of these populations as a new species of\nFossombronia, which is named and described herein as Fossombronia\ndelgadilloana. This new species resolves in a clade that is sister to F.\nperuviana, and is characterized by horizontal, planate,\nsub-longitudinally inserted leaves, widely dispersed antheridia, with\nbasally expanded stalks, stipitate caulocalyces that lack lamellae,\nobovoid to ellipsoidal capsules, I-type inner capsule wall thickenings,\nand spores that are > 40µm, with reticulate distal wall\nornamentation. Fossombronia herzogii is recognized as a new synonym of\nF. peruviana, and a new lectotype is designated for F.\nptychophylla.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124591.phy"}]}
