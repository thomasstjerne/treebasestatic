Emeticinae) resembles R. nobilis, but the\nnew taxon has a odorless context, and a larger inamyloid suprahilar\nplage of basidiospores with a lower ornamentation. Russula\npseudopectinatoides (R. sect. Foeteninae) is most similar to R.\npectinatoides Peck. The former has a context without a distinct odor, a\nstipe slightly rugulose longitudinally, basidiospores with lower warts\noften linked by fine lines, terminal cells of pileipellis with obtuse to\nventricose tips, and a habitat of coniferous to mixed forest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
