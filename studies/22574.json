The original\nidentification of the strain was based only on morphological characters\nof the fungal mycelium in culture. Recent comparison of internal\ntranscribed spacerÂ (ITS) fragments derived from the draft genome\npublished in 2015 did not reveal its similarity to G. candidum species.\nGiven the value of the strain Geotrichum candidum Link 3C in\nlignocellulosic biomass degradation, we performed morphological and\nmolecular studies to find the appropriate taxonomic placement for this\nfungal strain within the Ascomycota phylum. ITS, 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA\nsequences and RPB2 encoding genes were used to construct phylogenetic\ntrees with Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Based on\nmultiple gene sequencing, we conclude that fungal strain designated as\nGeotrichum candidum Link 3C should be placed into the genus Scytalidium\nand is redescribed herein as Scytalidium candidum 3C comb. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S rDNA tree","ntax":"252","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111443","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111443.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S rDNA tree","ntax":"372","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111554","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Multigene tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111577","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111577.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111572","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111572.phy"}]}
