It is characterized by perennial, pileate\nbasidiocarps, distinct shining poroid surface, zonate context, very\nsmall pores (1113 per mm), a dimitic hyphal structure with skeletal\nhyphae with a wide lumen both in trama and context, parallel tramal\nhyphae and regularly arranged contextual hyphae, the presence of\ncystidioles, globose, hyaline, thick-walled, smooth, dextrinoid,\nstrongly cyanophilous basidiospores measuring 5.87 × 5.46.5 µm, and\ngrowing on Hippophae rhamnoides in northern China. Fomitiporia\nrhamnoides differs from other Fomitiporia species growing on Hippophae\nby its smaller pores (1113 per mm vs. < 10 per mm).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111446","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111446.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111447.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111448","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111448.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111449.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111450","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111450.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111451","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111451.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111452","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111452.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111453","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111453.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111454.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111455.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111456","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111456.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111457","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111457.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111458","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111458.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111459","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111459.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111460","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111460.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111461","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111461.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111462","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111462.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111463","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111463.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111464","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111464.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111465","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111465.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111466","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111466.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111467","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111467.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111468.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111469.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111470.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111471.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111472.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111473","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111473.phy"}]}
