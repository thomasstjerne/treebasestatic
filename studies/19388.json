In the fungi, CM is\nbased on hyphal cells interconnected through septal pores. In the\nAscomycota, it emerged in the Pezizomycotina. The genus Neolecta defines\nan enigma: phylogenetically placed with early diverging yeast, Neolecta\nnevertheless possesses Pezizomycotina-like CM. Here, we sequence the\nNeolecta irregularis genome and identify candidate CM-associated\nfunctions by searching for genes present in Neolecta and the\nPezizomycotina, which are absent or divergent in budding and fission\nyeast. This group of over 1,000 genes is enriched for known functions\nrelated to diverse endomembrane systems. Functional genomics\ncharacterizes additional organelle-associated proteins playing important\nroles in hyphal development. Our data identify endomembrane systems\nproviding a foundation for the emergence of CM. Extensive convergent\ngene loss, degeneration and retention further suggest a deterministic\nprocess whereby shared modes of cellular organization select for the\nevolution of similarly configured organelle- and transport-related\nmachineries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96570.phy"}]}
