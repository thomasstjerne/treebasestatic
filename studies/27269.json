Here we initiate a\nseries of studies on botryosphaeriacous fungi associated with\nblueberries . As a result, two new species of Botryosphaeria causing\nblueberries stem canker, namely B. longispermatia and B. fujianensis,\nare described and illustrated in southern China. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on combined ITS, LSU, tef1-α and TUB loci support its separation\nfrom all other species of Botryosphaeria. Morphological characteristics\nare also distinguishable from those phylogenetic related species. Kochs\npostulates tests indicated that both B. longispermatia and B.\nfujianensis caused stem canker of blueberries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130601.phy"}]}
