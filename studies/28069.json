Studies reconstructing\nthe evolutionary history of this group have often relied on datasets of\none to a few genes for phylogenetic inference and ancestral character\nstate reconstruction. These studies suggest that multicellularity\nevolved only once in the volvocine algae, that each of its three\ncolonial families is monophyletic, and that there have been at least\nthree independent origins of cellular differentiation in the group. We\nperformed RNA-Seq on 55 strains representing 47 volvocine algal species\nand obtained similar data from curated databases on 13 additional\nstrains. We compiled a dataset consisting of transcripts for 40\nsingle-copy, protein-coding, nuclear genes, then subjected the predicted\namino acid sequences of these genes to maximum likelihood, Bayesian\ninference, and coalescent-based analyses. These analyses show that\nmulticellularity independently evolved at least twice in the volvocine\nalgae and that the colonial family Goniaceae is not monophyletic. Our\ndata further indicate that cellular differentiation independently arose\nat least four and possibly as many as six times within the group.\nAltogether, these results show how multicellularity and cellular\ndifferentiation are evolutionarily labile in the volvocine algae,\naffirming their importance for the study of major transitions in the\nhistory of life.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
