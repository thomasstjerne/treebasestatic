Morphological characteristics and\nphylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, β-tub, and tef-1α) show that they are\nunique and distinct from known species, which are named as P. subcacao\nand P. subminutispora. The detailed description, color photos,\nillustrations, and a key to related species are presented in this\npaper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128965.phy"}]}
