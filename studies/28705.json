This is the second\nreport of a sexual morph with molecular evidence for this genus and the\nsecond record of conidiogenesis and chlamydospores associated with the\nasexual state of this family.The sexual morph of Aplosporella\nabexaminans resembles Bagnisiella and the asexual morph resembles\nAplosporella, thus proving the sexual-asexual connection for the second\ntime for this family.It is characterized by its larger ascostromata,\nlocules without ostioles, thinner loculeperidium of two to\nmulti-layered, larger asci, surrounded by an additional hyaline sac like\nstructure, Ascospores are larger, hyaline to light olivaceous, asexual\nstate without conidiomata formation, presence of chlamydospores,\nconidiogenous cells light brown to brown, conidia smooth and brown","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1+","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133026","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133026.phy"}]}
