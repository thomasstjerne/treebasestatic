They are characterised by having\ndark brown to black, flattened ascomata, with a central ostiole,\nappearing as small black dots or thick stromata, forming superficially\non the substrate, without mycelium. Asci are bitunicate, 8-spored and\ncontain ellipsioidal, hyaline ascospores. Muyocopron thailandica sp.\nnov. was collected in northern Thailand, and extracted DNA directly from\nthe fruiting body. Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses based on LSU and ITS\nsequence data indicate that the new species forms a distinct lineage\nwithin the Muyocopron clade, and is related to M. castanopsis and M.\nlithocarpi. The new species differs from M. castanopsis in having\nellipsoid to subcylindrical asci, with a very short and thin pedicel,\noval to obovoid ascospores. Asci and ascospores of M. thailandica are\nlarger than those of M. castanopsis and M. lithocarpi. Description and\nillustrations of the new species are provided in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122873","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122873.phy"}]}
