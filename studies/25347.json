We show that ASDURF,\na recently discovered upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5Â’ UTR of\nASNSD1 mRNA, encodes the twelfth subunit of the PAQosome. ASDURF,\ndisplays significant structural homology to beta-prefoldins and\nassembles with the five known subunits of the prefoldin-like module of\nthe PAQosome to form a heterohexameric prefoldin-like complex. A model\nof the PAQosome prefoldin-like module is presented. The data presented\nhere provides an example of a eukaryotic uORF-encoded polypeptide whose\nfunction is not limited to cis-acting translational regulation of\ndownstream coding sequence and highlights the importance of including\nalternative ORF products in proteomic studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ASDURF","ntax":"4831","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ASDURF","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_120577.phy"}]}
