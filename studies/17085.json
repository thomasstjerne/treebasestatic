Known only from\nthe teleomorph, this fungus is characterised morphologically by a\nmembranous fruiting body with no appendages and ascospores with a sparse\nnetwork of ridges. Ribosomal DNA sequences place the new species within\nthe Onygenales, but comparison with the known genetic diversity within\nthe order linked it to no existing genus or family. It is the first\nspecies of Onygenales reported from the shells of terrestrial snails.\nThis fungus has been listed as Critically Endangered in New Zealand and\nhas been previously referred to as ‘Trichocomaceae gen. nov.’ in those\nthreat lists.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85445","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85445.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU+LSU","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85444","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85444.phy"}]}
