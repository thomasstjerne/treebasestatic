Two new species of Phyllosticta (P. dendrobii and P.\nillicii) are described and illustrated from Dendrobium nobile and\nIllicium verum in China. Phylogenetic analysis based on combined ITS,\nLSU, TEF, ACT and GPDH loci supported its separation from other species\nof Phyllosticta. Morphologically, P. dendrobii is most comparable with\nP. aplectri, while the large-sized pycnidia of P. dendrobii\ndifferentiate it from P. aplectri. Members of Phyllosticta are first\nreported from Dendrobium and Illicium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109580.phy"}]}
