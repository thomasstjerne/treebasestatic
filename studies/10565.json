Within the Eumida sanguinea species\ncomplex there are six different white pigmentation patterns but only\nthree of these are unique for a single species. No other consistent\nmorphological differences were observed. We give new species names to\nseven of the lineages from our study, providing examples of combined\nmorphological and molecular diagnoses, we apply the available name E.\nsanguinea to one species, and we leave two lineages with single\nrepresentatives unnamed. We also include new data and diagnosis for the\npoorly known E. notata which also belongs to the E. sanguinea species\ncomplex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9430","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9430.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9431","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9431.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9434","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9434.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9435","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9435.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9436","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9436.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9437","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9437.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9438","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9438.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9439.phy"}]}
