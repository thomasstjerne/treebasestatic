When it comes to preserved specimens (as in\ne.g.Â marine inventories), there is a particular need for specimen\nidentifier alternatives. Here, we evaluate the utility of COI\n(cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) as a single-locus barcoding gene. We\nsequenced, data mined, and compared gene fragments of COI for 915\nindividuals representing 161 putative species from 71 genera, and\nsubjected different constellations of these to both distance-based and\ncharacter-based DNA barcoding approaches. We analyzed the presence or\nabsence of a barcoding gap at different taxonomic levels (subclass,\nfamily and genus) in an attempt to understand at what level a putative\nbarcoding gap presents itself. Our data suggest that COI works as a\nspecies identifier for some groups within the phylum, but also that COI\ndata are obscured by misidentifications in sequence databases. Our\nresults furthermore highlight the presence of several cryptic lineages\nwithin well-established taxa and underscore the urgency of an updated\ntaxonomic backbone for this phylum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"915","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94712","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94712.phy"}]}
