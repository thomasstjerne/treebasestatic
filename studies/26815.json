The species has a broad\necological amplitude and a large distribution area. A thorough molecular\nanalysis based on four nuclear markers (ITS, LSU, RPB2 and TEF1-Î±) shows\nR. albonigra s.l. represents a species complex consisting of at least\nfive European species and three North-American species. A morphological\nstudy shows traditional characters used to delimit R. albonigra are not\nalways reliable and a new delimitation of the R. albonigra lineage is\nproposed and a key to the species of R. subg. Compactae is presented. An\nepitype is designated for R. albonigra and four new European species are\ndescribed: R. ambusta, R. nigrifacta, R. sardoa and R. ustulata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125416.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"figure 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125415.phy"}]}
