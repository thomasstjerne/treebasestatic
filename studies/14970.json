The phylogenetic placement of Chapsa\nlamellifera, C. megalophthalma and Diploschistes ocellatus was studied\nusing a data set of five genetic markers (mtSSU, nuLSU, RPB1, RPB2, and\nITS). As extratropical species occurring in Australasia, C. lamellifera\nand C. megalophthalma differ from other species in that genus by having\nrelatively large ascomata with muriform ascospores and complex chemistry\nof either the protocetraric or stictic acids chemosyndrome.\nDiploschistes ocellatus is unique within Diploschistes in lacking\nlateral paraphyses and containing the norstictic acid chemosyndrome.\nPrevious phylogenetic analysis gave inconclusive results regarding the\nphylogenetic position of these taxa, and hence in this study a larger\nsampling of molecular markers was employed. Our results demonstrate that\nthe two Chapsa species and D. ocellatus are not part of their current\ngenera. Consequently, the new genera Gintarasia Kraichak, Lücking &\nLumbsch and Xalocoa Kraichak, Lücking & Lumbsch are described to\naccommodate these species. The new combinations Gintarasia lamellifera\n(Kantvilas & Vězda) Kraichak, Lücking & Lumbsch, G. lordhowensis\n(Mangold) Kraichak, Lücking & Lumbsch, G. megalophthalma (Müll.\nArg.) Kraichak, Lücking & Lumbsch, and Xalocoa ocellata (Vill.)\nKraichak, Lücking & Lumbsch are also proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diploschistes MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68341.phy"}]}
