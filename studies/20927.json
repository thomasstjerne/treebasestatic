We studied\nthe cophylogeny of species of three genera of Monopisthocotylea,\nLamellodiscus, Dactylogyrus and Gyrodactylus, and their fish hosts to\ndetermine which evolutionary events determine speciation and identify a\ncommon set of principles driving coevolution in the three\nhost-monogenean systems studied. We used an event-based method (Jane)\nand a distance-base method (PACo) for cophylogenetic analysis. PACo\nrevealed a significant coevolution signal in all three systems. In the\nsignificant coevolutionary scenarios retrieved by Jane, the number of\ncospeciations was always low, the number of failures to diverge was\nalways high and relatively constant, and the number of losses was always\nthe highest. The number of duplications and duplications with\nhost-switching was more variable, but relatively high in most\nsituations. These results suggest that speciation in the three\nhost-monogenean systems is not driven primarily by the classical\nsynchronic cospeciation process postulated for terrestrial host-parasite\nsystems. Instead, pseudocospeciation (associated to host-switches),\nduplication and failure to diverge seemed to play a major role in\nshaping the current diversity and relationships to their hosts of the\nmonogeneans studied. Therefore, evolutionary mechanisms leading to host\nspecificity do not seem to primarily result from cospeciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103785.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103783.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103784.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103786.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103787.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103788.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103790","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103790.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103789.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103791.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103792","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103792.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103793.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103794","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103794.phy"}]}
