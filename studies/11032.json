This is particularly\nimportant for the green algae because in many genera structural\ncharacters are few or difficult to observe. In this study we test the\nutility of several DNA barcode loci in seven distantly related species\ngroups of charophytes and chlorophytes. The ITS rDNA and cox1 markers\nwere the most variable, although cox1 was least applicable because it\nwas successfully amplified and sequenced in only one test genus. The\nITS1 and ITS2 rDNA regions each amplified only a subset of the\ncharophytes. Both rbcL and tufA were moderately variable, although tufA\nmay pose challenges in some lineages where the gene is encoded in the\nnucleus. The 18S rDNA and UPA were the least variable loci tested. Of\nthe markers tested, rbcL, ITS and tufA (in chlorophytes) are the most\npromising for use as DNA barcodes. However, none of the loci tested were\nideal for use across all tested lineages of green algae because of\ntaxon-specific applicability and because none of the markers could\ndistinguish closely related species in all groups tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nitella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25883.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorosarcinopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25866.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chara","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25885.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Desmidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25886.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bracteacoccus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25870.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scenedesmus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25872.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Micrasterias","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25882.phy"}]}
