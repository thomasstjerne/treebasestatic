Kretzschmaria iranica is similar to K.\npavimentosa, but distinguishable by smaller ascospore size. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of a combined matrix of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregion of the nuclear rDNA and of Î±-actin (ACT1) gene sequences strongly\nsupport their status as two distinct new species within the genus\nKretzschmaria. Moreover, Kretzschmaria zonata, a species previously only\nknown from tropical countries, is encountered for the first time in\nIran.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum Likelihood tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114163.phy"}]}
