It occurs there\non open, rocky banks of clear, free-flowing rivers, habitats similar to\nthose in which it has been found in Norway. We also document the\noccurrence of C. rangiformis in North America, based on collections from\ntwo localities on the southwest coast of Conception Bay, on the Avalon\nPeninsula of the island of Newfoundland, Canada. It is possibly an\naccidental, but naturalized, introduction in this area, where European\nsettlement began in the early 1600s. A molecular phylogenetic analysis\nconfirmed the identity of one of the Newfoundland specimens. The IGS\nrDNA haplotype to which it belongs is the same as the most widely\ndistributed haplotype of C. rangiformis in Europe and Macaronesia.\nPrevious reports of C. rangiformis for continental North America are\nbased on misidentifications. A 19th century collection reportedly made\non the island of Bermuda, while correctly identified, is of uncertain\nprovenance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129212.phy"}]}
