One\nspecies (Pluteus umbrosoides) and one form (P. tomentosulus f.Â brunneus)\nare proposed as new, while P. rugosidiscus is a new record in Eurasia\nand P. velutinus is recorded for the first time in Russia. Detailed\nmorphological descriptions, illustrations and drawings of\nmicrostructures for new, rare and interesting taxa are provided.\nPhylogenetic analyses inferred from the internal transcribed spacer\n(nrITS) were conducted for species delimitation and for comparisons with\nclosely related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97499.phy"}]}
