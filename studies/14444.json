The taxonomy\nof this group is unclear with some entities treated infraspecifically or\nas synonyms. Furthermore, the existence of diploids and tetraploids in\nthis species complex is suggestive of reticulate evolution. In order to\nformulate a natural classification and to investigate the relationships\nin this complex, phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear sequence\ndata and inference of ploidy level were used to assess the\ndistinctiveness of putative taxonomic units and their relationships. The\nAsplenium normale complex was recovered as a monophyletic group\ncomprising six principal chloroplast lineages. The results support the\nhypothesis that A. normale s. l. contains several species. Based on our\ninferences, we outline an improved species classification recognizing\nthree diploid and four tetraploid entities. Incongruence of chloroplast\nand nuclear phylogenies was interpreted to be a result of recurrent\nreticulation events in the A. normale complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium normale complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64876.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium normale complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64875.phy"}]}
