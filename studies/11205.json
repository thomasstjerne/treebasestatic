Vaccinioideae\nare highly dependent on their mycorrhizal symbiosis and Sebacinales\n(basidiomycetes) were previously found to be the dominant mycobionts of\nAndean Clade Vaccinioideae (Neotropical Vaccinieae). We were interested\nto see wether the North American Vaccinioideae invaded the Neotropics by\ntaking their mycobionts with them or by the acquisition of new, local\nSebacinales. We investigated Sebacinales of 58 individuals of\nVaccinioideae from Ecuador, Panama and North America in order to see\nwhether the mycobionts of each region are distantly or closely related.\nWe isolated the ITS of the ribosomal nuclear DNA in order to infer a\nmolecular phylogeny of Sebacinales and to determine Molecular Operation\nTaxonomic Units (MOTUs). The MOTU delimitation was based on a 3%\nthreshold of ITS variability and conducted with complete linkage\nclustering. The analyses revealed that most Sebacinales from Ecuador,\nPanama and North America are closely related and that two MOTUs out of\n33 have a distribution ranging from the Neotropics to the Pacific\nNorthwest of North America. The data suggest that Neotropical and\ntemperate Vaccinioideae of North America share their Sebacinales\ncommunities and that both, plants and fungi, migrated together.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sebacinales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31458.phy"}]}
