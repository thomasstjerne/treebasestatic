In 2017, some trees in Pizhou, Jiangsu\nProvince showed symptoms of wilting. Leaves of diseased trees appeared\nbrown, wilted and wrinkled, the roots had rotted and the xylem had\nbecome discolored. Investigations indicated that the disease spread\nrapidly and that the infection rate was high. The outbreak period was\nfrom July to August, which suggested that the high temperatures in\nsummer had no inhibitory effect on the occurrence of the disease. The\npathogenicity test showed that a fungus isolated from the discolored\nvascular tissues at a high frequency, which was named An7, could lead to\n100% mortality of healthy 2-year-old seedlings following inoculation.\nDifferent sizes of conidia, chlamydospores and conidiophores were\nobserved. Molecular analysis of the partial sequences of the rDNA\ninternal transcribed spacer, intergenic spacer region and mitochondrial\nsmall subuni, and the translation elongation factor 1-Î± was carried out\nin combination with evaluation of morphological parameters, to achieve\nreliable identification of the pathogen. The pathogen was identified on\nmorphological and molecular grounds as Fusarium oxysporum. To our\nknowledge, this is the first report of F. oxysporum causing wilt on A.\nnegundo in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115063.phy"}]}
