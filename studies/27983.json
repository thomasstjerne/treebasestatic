Hyphoderma macrocrystallina is characterized by the resupinate\nbasidiomata with smooth hymenial surface scattering the nubby crystal, a\nmonomitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, and numerous\nencrusted cystidia present. Hyphoderma microporoides is characterized by\nthe resupinate, cottony basidiomata distributing the tiny pinhole on the\nhymenial surface, presence of halocystidia and cylindrical to allantoid\nbasidiospores. Hyphoderma vacuspora is characterized by the resupinate\nbasidiomata with tuberculate hymenial surface, presence of moniliform\ncystidia and ellipsoid to cylindrical basidiospores (1113.5 × 4.55.5\nµm). Sequences of ITS+nLSU rRNA gene regions of the studied samples were\ngenerated and phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. These\nphylogenetic analyses showed that three new species clustered into\nHyphoderma, in which H. macrocrystallina was sister to H. variolosum; H.\nmicroporoides closely grouped with H. nemorale; H. vacuspora was\nretrieved as a sister species of H. sinense (100% BS, 100% BP and 1.00\nBPP).","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133593.phy"}]}
