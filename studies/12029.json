The species\nis only the second representative of the family Lepidostromataceae\ndocumented from the New World, and is one of the few described lichens\nwith an inverted morphology, with the algae in a layer at the base of\nthe thallus. Molecular sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal LSU\nlocus are used to confirm the placement of the holotype in Lepidostroma\nand to evaluate the molecular distinctiveness of the species from all\nother described species in the family and genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidostroma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50576.phy"},{"tree_label":"bkbn","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepidostroma Backbone","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50577.phy"}]}
