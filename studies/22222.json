Phylloporus boletinoides\nis a species which was described from Florida, and is found growing near\nPinus spp. Based on ITS, LSU, and RPB1 sequences, we establish the novel\ngenus Pseudophylloporus, which is allied to Bothia and Solioccasus.\nMorphological data are also provided from our collections, and one from\nBelize. Based on molecular data and a review of bolete literature, the\ndelimitation of this genus suggests that there are three distinct\nlineages of boletes that have a lamellate hymenium in the\nBoletaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109857.phy"}]}
