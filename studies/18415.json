The genus is characterised by reduced, intercalary phialidic\nconidiogenous cells with conspicuous collarettes. N. mali was obtained\nfrom crabapple fruit from China that exhibited the punctate mycelial\ntype, and caused the same mycelial type on apple fruit after\ninoculation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FIG. 1 The ML tree inferred from nrLSU data","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished Bayesian phylogeny from LSU alignment","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91664.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished parsimony phylogeny from LSU alignment","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91666.phy"},{"tree_label":"FIG. 2 The ML tree determined from ITS-nrLSU-mrSSU-EF1\n¦Á combined dataset","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished parsimony phylogeny from combined\nalignment","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished Bayesian phylogeny from combined\nalignment","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91670.phy"}]}
