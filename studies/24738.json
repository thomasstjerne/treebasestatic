Morphologically G. sinensis is similar to G. cooperi, G. gilkeyae\nand G. tolucana, but distinguished from them by the combination of\nbroadly ellipsoid ascospores and white hymenium. ITS-based phylogenetic\nanalysis supports the erection of the new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopora sinensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118959.phy"}]}
