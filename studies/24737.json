The disease is endemic to arid regions of the\nsouthwestern US and while most common in CA and AZ is also present in\nNM. We present the first genetic analysis of clinical isolates from NM.\nTravel and demographic information was available for a number of\npatients, which included individuals from NM and the southwestern US\nFour Corners region. Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses revealed the\npresence of both C. posadasii and C. immitis. While NM is predicted to\nbe within the endemic range for C. posadasii, our results expand the\nknown range of C. immitis, often considered to be the “California\nspecies.” Five of eight infections for which patient ethnicity existed\noccurred in Native Americans, and two occurred in African Americans.\nSeveral isolates came from the northwestern part of NM outside the\npredicted “highly-endemic” region. Our study suggests Native Americans\nrepresent an unrecognized at-risk group, and it provides a foundation\nfor better defining the geographic distribution of the Coccidioides\nspecies and for preventing exposure among populations at risk. In the\ncourse of this study we developed a reliable PCR-based method to\ndistinguish species targeting regions of the mitochondrial genome.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118884.phy"}]}
