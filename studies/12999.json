D. scytobrachion can be distinguished from other silesaurids by the\npresence of anteriorly−canted teeth that decrease in size towards the\nanterior end of the dentary and a distinct lateral ridge running\nparallel to the dentary alveolar margin. In a phylogenetic analysis, D.\nscytobrachion is recovered as the sister−taxon to the Brazilian\nSacisaurus agudoensis, nested deep within Silesauridae. This new taxon\nprovides further evidence of a near−cosmopolitan range for basal\ndinosauriforms in the Late Triassic and further demonstrates the\ndisparity of dental morphologies within Silesauridae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Silesauridae Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55117.phy"}]}
