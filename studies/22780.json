Based on field work in April 2006 and 2008,\nwhich generated 24 specimens of mycenoid fungi, we recognize 14 species\nof Mycena, and 5 species belonging to the allied genera Clitocybula,\nFiloboletus, Hydropus and “Trogia”. Of these, 9 species are recognized\nherein as new to science, viz., Mycena antennae, M. brunneoviolacea, M.\nlonginqua, M. oboensis, M. phaeonox, M. solis, Clitocybula intervenosa,\nHydropus globosporus, and H. murinus; and additional 10 species are new\ndistribution reports for São Tomé and Príncipe. Species delimitations\nare based on comprehensive morphological descriptions and molecular\nsequences (ITS) data. Line drawings of salient micromorphological\nfeatures, color photographs of basidiomes, comparisons with allied taxa,\na key to aid in identification, and phylogenetic inferences are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML ITS Mycena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112072.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML ITS Hydropoid Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112064.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML nLSU Agaricales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112087.phy"}]}
