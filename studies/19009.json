Species boundaries\nwere inferred from multiple lines of evidence arising from mitochondrial\nand nuclear DNA sequencing and ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic\nrelationships among species were assessed by Bayesian inference and\nmaximum likelihood procedures. The approach was applied to the\nterrestrial gastropod genus Pyramidula. By examining 211 specimens\ncollected from the Western Palaearctic region, we here identified nine\nputative species for this region. So far, descriptions of the\nmorphospecies of this genus had been based exclusively on shell\ncharacters. Hence, we also studied the variation of shell characters to\nassess their utility to differentiate the species defined, and to\nexamine whether shell shape in Pyramidula is influenced by environmental\nfactors. Our findings indicate that although shell characters serve to\ndiscriminate between some putative species, they are not sufficient as\nunique taxonomic characters and other lines of evidence are needed.\nAccording to our ecological niche modeling results, shell shape may be\ninfluenced by environmental factors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2.
