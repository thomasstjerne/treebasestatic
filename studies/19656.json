The order includes free-living\naquatic and soil-dwelling species, but its phylogenetic position has\nremained uncertain. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of\ntwo members of this order, Plectus acuminatus and Plectus aquatilis and\ncompared them with those of other major nematode clades. The genome size\nand base composition of these species are similar to other nematodes;\n14,831 and 14,372 bp, respectively with AT contents of 71.0% and 70.1%.\nGene content was also similar to other nematodes, but their gene order\nand coding direction was dissimilar from other chromadorean species. P.\nacuminatus and P. aquatilis are the first chromadorean species found to\ncontain a gene inversion. We reconstructed mitochondrial genome\nphylogenetic trees using nucleotide and amino acid datasets from 807\nnematodes that represent major nematode clades, including the Plectus\nsequences. Trees from phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and\nBayesian methods depicted Plectida as the sister group to all other\nchromadorean nematodes. This finding is consistent with several\nphylogenetic results based on SSU rDNA, but disagrees with a\nclassification based on morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NT_BI","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromadorea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97598.phy"},{"tree_label":"NT_ML_Bootstrap","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromadorea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97603.phy"},{"tree_label":"AA_ML_Bootstrap","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromadorea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97601.phy"},{"tree_label":"AA_BI","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA_BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97599.phy"},{"tree_label":"AA_ML_Besttree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA_ML_Besttree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97600.phy"},{"tree_label":"NT_ML_Besttree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NT_ML_Besttree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97602.phy"}]}
