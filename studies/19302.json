This species is florally similar to B.\nparkinsonii but differs in its aerial thickened stems (‘pseudobulbs’)\nand several floral attributes. A phylogenetic analysis of nuclear\nribosomal ITS DNA sequences indicates that B. mixtecana and B.\nparkinsonii are not closely related, suggesting that floral similarity\nrepresents either parallelism or shared ancestral (symplesiomorphic)\ntraits. The new species is a strict gypsophile known only from two\npopulations and it qualifies as endangered based on the small number of\nknown populations and individuals, high habitat specificity and the\nobserved loss of plants at one of the two known locations","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bletia mixtecana ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96061.phy"}]}
