Putative hybrid lineages are common in\nwater fleas, but their ecological success is often associated with\npolyploidy and the production of asexual propagules. Advanced hybrid\nlineages with sexual propagules are expected to be geographically\nrestricted because their successful dispersal is contingent on\novercoming fertility complications, assimilation by parent taxa, and\ncompetition with parent taxa. Here we provide evidence that a diploid\nlineage of Daphnia has been formed by introgression between distantly\nrelated species and attained a broad distribution (Nearctic) despite its\nrequirement for sexual propagules. The evidence is based on geographical\ndiscordance, phylogenetic discordance, recombinant genotypes and\nadditive genotypes of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS) and mitochondrial DNA. Additive genotypes also provided evidence\nof hybridization between introduced European Daphnia and North American\nDaphnia . We argue that the unique biology of Holarctic lacustrine water\nfleas and the spatial separation of lineages during Pleistocene\nglaciation have promoted hybridization and its evolutionary\nconsequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS-1 Clone tree","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daphnia, tree 42925","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4514.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daphnia, tree 10","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4515.phy"}]}
