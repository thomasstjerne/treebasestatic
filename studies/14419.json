Based on\nmorphology and multigene phylogenies, species were identified as P.\noxalicum, P. skrjabinii, and four thatwere previously unknown.Multigene\nphylogenies resolve the new species into three consistent clades.\nSpecies from these clades were compared morphologically, and the new\nspecies are described here as P. annulatum, P. curticaule, P.\nmalacosphaerulum, and P. ortum. Penicillium annulatum (CBS 135126T)\ncharacteristically produces colonies on Czapek yeast autolysate (CYA)\nand yeast extract sucrose (YES) agar that sporulate in annular patterns\nand grow faster on CYA at 37 °C than those of closely related species,\nexcept for the faster growing P. rolfsii. Penicillium curticaule (CBS\n135128T) most closely resembles P. raperi, but grows more restrictedly\non CYA at 37 °C and produces shorter phialides. Penicillium ortum\n(CBS135668T) grows faster on CYA at 37 °C than P. cremeogriseum, its\nclosest relative. Penicillium malacosphaerulum (CBS 135120T) produces\ncleisthothecia that give colonies on most media a yellowish straw color,\nsimilar to those of P. reticulisporum. However, faster growth on CYA at\n37 °C distinguishes the new species from P. reticulisporum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BenA_BI2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata BenA BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92804.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA_BI1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata BenA BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92803.phy"},{"tree_label":"CaM_BI2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata CMD BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92809.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2_BI2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata RPB2 BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92805.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2_BI1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata RPB2 BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92806.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_ML","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92796.phy"},{"tree_label":"CaM_BI1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium section Lanata-Divaricata CMD BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92810.phy"}]}
