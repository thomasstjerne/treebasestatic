Though the\nmajority of these birds appear referable to the ornithuromorph Gansus\nyumenensis, a number of enantiornithine fossils have also been\nrecovered. Here we report on a specimen consisting of a complete,\nthree−dimensionally preserved sternum, furcula, and sternal ribs that\nrepresents a second ornithuromorph taxon from the Xiagou Formation at\nChangma. The fossil exhibits morphologies that distinguish it from all\npreviously−known Xiagou birds and demonstrate that it represents a\nderived non−ornithurine member of Ornithuromorpha. Though it is\nmorphologically distinct from the equivalent elements of all other\ndescribed ornithuromorphs, the material is too incomplete to justify the\nerection of a new taxon. Nonetheless, it increases the taxonomic\ndiversity of the Xiagou avifauna, thereby expanding our knowledge of\nEarly Cretaceous avian diversity and evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55902.phy"}]}
