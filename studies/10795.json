The taxon sampling comprises 10 out of the 12 species that\nare recognized in the genus and in addition the recently described\nForsstroemia remotifolia. The revision is based on phylogenetic analyses\nusing sequence level data from the plastid trnT-(rps4)-trnL-trnF cluster\nand rpl16 as well as nuclear ITS1 and 2. Forsstroemia japonica was\nplaced next to Shevockia inunctocarpa in a clade only remotely related\nto Forsstroemia. Thus F. japonica is transferred to Shevockia.\nForsstroemia remotifolia is renamed as Leptodon remotifolius. The other\nnine species in Forsstroemia form a monophyletic group, six of the\nspecies being restricted to Asia, one (F. coronata) to South America,\nand two (F. producta, F. trichomitria) having a wider distribution. A\npreviously suggested hybrid origin for F. coronata was not supported by\nthe sequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21346","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21346.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21347","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21347.phy"}]}
