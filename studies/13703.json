Disentangling the Dicranum scoparium Species\nComplex (Dicranaceae, Bryophyta)","Journal":" Systematic Biology","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Chloroplast DNA, ITS, molecular phylogeny, species\ncircumscriptions, morphology","DOI":"","Abstract":" Dicranum is a large (c. 90 species) and taxonomically\ncomplex genus of mosses. Circumscriptions and relationships of many\nDicranum species remain ambiguous due to the absence of a worldwide\nrevision and comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analyses. In the\npresent study, species circumscriptions of morphologically similar, and\npossibly closely related, Dicranum species (D. scoparium, D. bonjeanii,\nD. fuscescens, D. howellii, D. cf. japonicum, D. majus, D. nipponense,\nand D. spadiceum) are analysed based on chloroplast (rpoB, trnH-psbA,\ntrnL-trnF, rps4-trnT, rps19-rpl2) and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences.\nContrary to their morphological resemblance and the presence of\nintergrading forms, all analysed species are molecularly separated and\nform well supported clades in the molecular phylogenetic\nreconstructions. The identity of two North American D. cf. scoparium\nspecimens, which may represent a formerly separate taxon or a\n‘pseudo-cryptic’ species, remains to be tested. Dicranum bonjeanii, D.\nhowellii, D. cf. japonicum, D. nipponense, and D. scoparium (all sect.\nDicranum) can be comprised as D. scoparium species complex, while D.\nmajus (sect. Dicranum) and species currently considered to belong to\nother sections (D. fuscescens and D. spadiceum) are separated from this\ncomplex. Further supraspecific relationships remain largely unresolved\nbased on the present molecular data. The significance of morphological\ncharacters for species identification are discussed. It is concluded\nthat a combined morpho-molecular approach allows clear species\ncircumscriptions in Dicranum, which is a promising result for the study\nof other taxonomically difficult complexes of closely related species in\nbryophytes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Dic_CPall_MB","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66053.phy"},{"tree_label":"Dic_CPall_ML","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66054.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66786.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0+","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66787.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66788.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66789.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66790.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicranum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66791.phy"}]}
