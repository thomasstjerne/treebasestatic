Current\ntaxonomic knowledge relies solely on limited morphological information,\nwhereas there is no type material. Here, we aim to resolve issues\nconcerning its morphology and taxonomy using both morphological and\ngenetic characters on material sampled from the type locality, Lake\nBalaton (Hungary), as well as Lake Doirani (Greece) which was selected\nfor comparison purposes. Biometrical analysis was based on extensive\nlorica measurements. Phylogenetic reconstruction was based on DNA\nsequence information of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I\n(COI) and 16S rRNA gene regions as well as of the nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacer 1 (ITS1).Well-supported evidence for substantial\ndifferentiation of B. sessilis from its closest phylogenetic relatives\nconsents to its species-rank status. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests\na highly supported clade encompassing B. sessilis and another epizoic\nrotifer, namely B. rubens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77387.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77382.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77384.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50MajRule of COI+ITS+16S","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77290.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brachionus sessilis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77385.phy"}]}
