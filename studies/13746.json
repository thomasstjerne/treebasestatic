Generally,\nmultiple cytosol-type Hsp70s can be found in metazoans that show either\nconstitutive expression and/or stress-inducibility arguing for the\nevolution of different tasks and functions. Information about the hsp70\ncopy number and diversity in microbial eukaryotes is, however, scarce\nand detailed knowledge about the differential gene expression in most\nprotists is lacking. Therefore, we have characterised the Hsp70 gene\nfamily of Paramecium caudatum to gain insight into the evolution and\ndifferential heat stress response of the distinct family members in\nprotists and to investigate the diversification of eukaryotic hsp70s\nfocusing on the evolution of heat-inducibility.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hsp70 gene family","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60046.phy"}]}
