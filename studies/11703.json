Descriptions of new chytridiomycete\norders are based on molecular and ultrastructural characters, which have\nbeen phylogenetically mutually supportive. The Polychytrium clade has\nconsisted of a few chitinophilic, soil and aquatic chytrids that\nclustered in phylogenetic hypotheses but have not been placed in a new\norder. We isolated additional putative members of this clade, sequenced\ntheir nucSSU and nucLSU rDNA and examined zoospores of some of the\nisolates with TEM. Our isolates are in a well-supported clade with\nprevious Polychytrium clade members, but zoospore ultrastructural types\nvary within the clade, with characters that often are conserved within\nother orders (e.g.Â flagellar plug, rumposome) being either present or\nabsent. Based on the isolates in culture we describe the Polychytrium\nclade as the Polychytriales. This order contains Polychytrium,\nLacustromyces, Karlingiomyces, two new genera (Arkaya and Neokarlingia)\nand additional undescribed taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polychytriales ord. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47393.phy"}]}
