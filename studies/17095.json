Conflicts may emerge from several processes\nincluding paralogy, hybridization, and incomplete lineage sorting.\nAlthough phylogenetic incongruence appears common, its impact on many\nphylogeny-based analyses remains poorly known. â Methods: Here we\nexamine the occurrence of phylogenetic conflict between nuclear\n(ribosome ITS) and plastid (rbcL, trnL-F, rpl20-rps12 and rps16 intron)\nloci in the ancient angiosperm family Chloranthaceae. Then, we\ninvestigate how phylogenetic conflict bears on taxonomic classification\nwithin the family as well as inferences on biogeographical history,\nfloral evolution, and measures of phylogenetic diversity (PD). â Key\nresults: We found evidence for significant phylogenetic incongruence\nbetween plastid and nuclear data in the genus Hedyosmum. Within\nHedyosmum, our results do not support previous subgeneric classification\nof the genus. Division of sections within subgenus Tafalla is supported\nby the ITS data but not by the plastid data set. As a consequence, we\nshow that inferring the evolution of key floral characters and\ngeographical history within Hedyosmum depends on the phylogenetic data\nused. Both data sets yield similar PD measures across genera, but we\nfind contrasting PD measures in Hedyosmum, even after correcting for\nrate heterogeneity. â Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that\nphylogenetic conflict not only affects the inference of organismal\nrelationships but also impacts our understanding of biogeographical\nhistory, morphological evolution and phylogenetic diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85470.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85471.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85472.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85473","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85473.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 1 trees from Stored Trees (Trees\n“Consensus Trees from Tree Blocks” from file\nChloranthaceae_rbcL_raxml_bootstrap_contree.nex)","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85600.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85603","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85603.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85604","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85604.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85605.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85606.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85607.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr85608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85608.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Default Bush+","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85610.phy"}]}
