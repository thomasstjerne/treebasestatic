This paper describes females and juveniles\nfrom four of those populations on the basis of morphology and\nmorphometrics and provides molecular characterization of this species\nusing 18S, ITS1 and D2-D3 expansion segments of 28S rRNA gene sequences.\nMorphometrically, females differed mainly in V ratio (in four\npopulations 41.9 (38.6 â 44.3), 42.7 (41.6 â 44.0), 46.1 (43.9 â 48.0),\n46.8(44.6 - 51)) and odontostylet length (166.6 (163 - 172), 170.6 (161\n- 180), 191.5 (182 â 198), 193.2 (180 - 206) Âµm). Phylogenetic analysis\nshowed Paralongidorus rex has a sister relationship with P. iranicus.\nPCR-D2-D3 of 28S-RFLP diagnostic profiles with five enzymes are given.\nAdditionally, information on new host plants and map of distribution for\nParalongidorus rex are provided. Based on comparaison of obtained D2-D3\nexpansion segemnts of 28S rRNA new record of this nematode species from\nSlovakia is given. Finally, remarks on the potential importance of this\nspecies in grapevine production are given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76586","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76586.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76587","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76587.phy"}]}
