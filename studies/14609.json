In South Africa, the extent\nof genetic variation among citrus associated P. citrophthora isolates is\nunknown. This was therefore investigated using isolates from South\nAfrica (n=60), Spain (n=10), and six reference isolates representing\nthree P. citrophthora groups CTR1, CTR2 and CTR3 previously identified\nby Mchau & Coffey (1994) using isozyme polymorphisms. Isolates from\nSouth Africa and Spain belonged to two lineages (G1 and G2) based on an\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogeny and random amplified\nmicrosatellites (RAMS) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\nprofiling. Although the combined RAMS and RAPD data identified 14\ngenotypes among these isolates, unweighted pair group method with\narithmetic mean (UPGMA) analyses grouped the isolates into two distinct\nclusters that corresponded to the G1 and G2 lineages. The G1 lineage\npredominated among isolates from South Africa (92 %) and Spain (100 %).\nPhylogenetic analyses of the ÃŸ-tubulin, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I\n(COX1) and ITS regions did not support the hypothesis that the two\nlineages represent distinct phylogenetic species, but suggested that\nisozyme group CTR2 and possibly CTR3 should be redescribed as species\ndistinct from P. citrophthora (South African, Spanish and CTR1 reference\nisolates). Mating type analyses, using tester strains from groups CTR2\nand CTR3 revealed that most G1 isolates were sterile (n = 57) but that a\nfew were of the A1 mating type (n = 8), whereas all G2 isolates were A2\nmating type (n = 5). The mating type designation was confirmed using P.\ncapsici tester strains. However, when the A1 (G1 lineage) and A2 (G2\nlineage including CTR1 reference isolates) mating type isolates were\npaired in all possible combinations with each other, no oogonia or\nantheridia were produced. This suggests that only the tester P. capsici,\nCTR2 and CTR3 strains were able to produce sexual structures and that\nthe G1 and G2 lineages are sterile and reproductively isolated, which is\nsupported by the molecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COI ML","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65807.phy"},{"tree_label":"CONC BA","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65806.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub ML - only representative strains included","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub BA - only representative strains included","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69033","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69033.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub, COI, and ITS ML - only representative strains\nincluded","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69035.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI BA - only representative strains included","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69038.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BA","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65803.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65804.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub BA","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65809.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub ML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr65810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65810.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML - representative isolates only","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69150.phy"},{"tree_label":"CONC ML","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65805.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI ML - only representative strains included","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69037.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI BA","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Btub, COI, and ITS BA - only representative strains\nincluded","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69036.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BA - representative isolates only","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69151.phy"}]}
