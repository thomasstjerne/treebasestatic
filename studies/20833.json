Genes with significant positive selection and biased\nfunctions were also detected which could play important roles in rice\ndomestication and differentiation processes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"differentiation of japonica and indica rice\ncultivars","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"differentiation of japonica and indica rice\ncultivars","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103252.phy"}]}
