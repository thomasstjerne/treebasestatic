Uncinula on Salix\nspp., a species belonging to Salix subgen. Vetrix sect. Vetrix, is\ndescribed as Erysiphe salicina based on morphological and molecular\nanalyses. The new species is distinctly different from E. capreae,\nmainly occurring on Salix caprea and allied species of Salix subgen.\nVetrix sect. Vetrix, by having shorter conidiophores (mostly 4887 vs\n80150) and fewer appendages per chasmothecium (mostly 2253 vs 50400).\nThe new species is genetically as well as morphologically rather similar\nto E. salicis, but differs in having fewer appendages (mainly 2253 vs\n2595) and asci (mainly 57 vs 515) per chasmothecium. The phylogeny of\nthe new species and closely related species on Populus and Salix spp.\n(Salicaceae) was reconstructed and discussed using a combined alignment\nof ITS and 28S rDNA sequences. The phylogenetic results demonstrated\nthat the sequences obtained from the ten examined collections on Salix\nspp. clustered together as an independent lineage with 100% bootstrap\nsupport, suggesting the involvement of a species of its own.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_8","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133028","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133028.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_6","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133040.phy"}]}
