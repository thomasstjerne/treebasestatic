Growth tests showed that T.\nreniformisporum and T. cylindrosporum are psychrotrophic fungi, with\noptimal growth temperatures of 2022 ℃, and minimum growth temperatures\nbelow 5 ℃.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiocordycipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121807.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiocordycipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121808.phy"}]}
