The grouping was not correlated with winter coat color,\nbut was consistent with geography. In particular, the monophyly of 29\nindividuals of Tsushima martens, M. m. tsuensis, was supported by strong\nclade support and topological tests. Haplotype and nucleotide\ndiversities were much lower for the Tsushima population than any other\npopulation in the Japanese main islands. In addition, analyses of the\nheterozygosity of the nuclear growth hormone receptor gene sequences\n(654 bp) showed genetic homogeneity in the Tsushima population. This\nevidence supports the view that it is Tsushima martens f long history of\nisolation on a small island that is responsible for their genetic\ndistinctiveness and uniformity, validating the Tsushima population as an\nevolutionarily significant unit.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Martes melampus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6150.phy"}]}
