Species of\nAppendiculella and Asteridiella are included in a DNA sequence analysis\nfor the first time and are resolved as more closely related to each\nother than to Meliola. The three new species of Meliolaceae described by\nmaterial collected in Panama include Appendiculella monsterae on\nMonstera deliciosa (Araceae), Asteridiella nitidae on Buddleja nitida\n(Scrophulariaceae), and Irenopsis chrysophylli on Chrysophyllum sp.\n(Sapotaceae). Twenty one Meliolaceae are reported for the first time for\nPanama and six species of plants are cited as hosts for meliolaceous\nfungi for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62758.phy"}]}
