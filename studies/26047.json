Through analyzing well-preserved fossil scutella,\nshield-like covers of fungal sporocarps, we describe a new taxon of\nearly Dothideomycetes with a combination of characters unknown among\nextant taxa. METHODS: Macerated clays from the Potomac Group, lower Zone\n1, from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian, 125113 Ma) of Virginia USA yielded\none gymnospermous leaf cuticle colonized by 21 sporocarps of a single\nfungal morphotype. We inferred a tree from nuclear ribosomal DNA of\nextant species, and coded morphological characters to evaluate\nalternative, equally parsimonious placements of the fossil in a\nmolecular constraint tree of extant species. RESULTS: Bleximothyrium\nostiolatum gen. et sp. nov. has an ostiolate scutellum of radiate,\ndichotomizing hyphae. Unlike otherwise similar extant and fossil taxa,\nB. ostiolatum has tangled hyphae at its scutellum margin. Scutella of B.\nostiolatum are connected to superficial mycelium, to intercalary and\nlateral appressoria, and to extensive subcuticular “mycélium en\npalmettes”. The gymnospermous host has characters consistent with\nidentity as a non-papillate ginkgophyte or cycad. CONCLUSIONS:\nBleximothyrium ostiolatum is the oldest known fossil fly-speck fungus\nthat occurs on plant cuticles and has the radiate, ostiolate scutellum\nknown only from Dothideomycetes. Its combination of characters, its\nscutellum margin, and mycélium en palmettes are unknown in other extant\nand fossil species, and Bleximothyrium ostiolatum likely represents a\nnew group of fly-speck fungi that may now be extinct.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_10","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122885","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122885.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_5","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122880","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122880.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_14","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122904.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_13","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122903.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_11","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122901.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_7","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122897.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_6","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122896.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_4","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122894.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122891.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_14","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122889.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_9","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122884.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_7","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122882","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122882.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_4","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122879.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_9","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122899","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122899.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_5","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122895.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122893.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122892.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_15","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122890.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported
