Morphological and molecular data show that these species\nhave not been described before, hence need to be described as new. The\nphylogenetic placements of these species were inferred, based on\nmolecular evidence from sequences of 28S and RPB2. Additional analysis\nusing ITS dataset shows interspecific variation between each species.\nPhylogenetic analyses resolve I. flavobrunneum in Old World Tropical\nclade 1 with weak support, I. bulbomarginatum is sister of Old World\nTropical clade 1 and I. africanum is indicated as sister to the rest of\nInosperma. Complete description and illustrations, including photographs\nand line drawings, are presented for each species. A new combination of\nInocybe shawarensis into Inosperma is also proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128190.phy"}]}
