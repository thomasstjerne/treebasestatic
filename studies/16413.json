Breakthroughs in diversification can occur,\nhowever, when functional integration among structures is relaxed.\nAlthough such transitions are expected to generate variation in\nmorphological diversification across the tree of life, empirical tests\nof this hypothesis are rare. Here, we show that transitions between\nsuction-based and biting modes of prey capture, which require different\ndegrees of coordination among skull components, are associated with\nshifts in the pattern of skull diversification in eels (Anguilliformes).\nBiting eels have experienced greater independence of the jaws, hyoid,\nand operculum during evolution and exhibit more varied morphologies than\nclosely related suction feeders, and this pattern reflects the weakened\nfunctional integration among skull components required for biting. Our\nresults suggest that behavioral transitions can change the evolutionary\npotential of the vertebrate skeleton by altering functional\nrelationships among structures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77788.phy"}]}
