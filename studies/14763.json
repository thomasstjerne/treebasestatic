In\nrecent years, a number of new terrestrial trebouxiophycean taxa were\ndescribed from soils, tree bark, and lichens. The present phylogenetic\nstudy reveals three new lineages of free-living trebouxiophyceans found\nin North American desert soil crusts and proposes new generic names to\naccommodate them: Desertella, Eremochloris, and Xerochlorella. This\nsurvey of desert isolates also led to discovery of representatives of\nseven existing genera of trebouxiophyceans. Two of these genera have\nnever been reported to contain desert representatives and one was known\npreviously only from aquatic habitats. Furthermore, we expand the known\ngeographic range of the recently described genus Chloropyrula,\nheretofore only known from the Ural Mountains. We demonstrate that the\ndiversity of trebouxiophyceans is still underestimated and poorly\nunderstood, and that most major trebouxiophycean lineages contain\ndesert-dwelling taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rbcLbestMLtree","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxiophyceae rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75036.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S-Treb","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trebouxiophyceae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88746.phy"}]}
