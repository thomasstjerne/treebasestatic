Ambrosia beetles, dominant\nwood degraders in the tropics, create tunnels in dead trees and employ\ngardens of symbiotic fungi to extract nutrients from wood. The\nmycocleptic species seek brood galleries of other species, and exploit\ntheir established fungal gardens by tunneling through the ambient\nmycelium-laden wood. Instead of carrying their own fungal sybmbionts,\nmycocleptae depend on adopting the fungal assemblages of their host\nspecies, as shown by an analysis of fungal DNA from beetle galleries.\nThe evidence for widespread horizontal exchange of fungi between beetles\nchallenges the traditional concept of ambrosia fungi as species-specific\nsymbionts. Fungus stealing appears to be an evolutionarily successful\nstrategy. It evolved independently in several beetle clades, two of\nwhich have radiated, and at least one case was accompanied by a loss of\nthe beetles’ fungus-transpor! ting organs. We demonstrate this using the\nfirst robust phylogeny of one of the world’s largest group of ambrosia\nbeetles, Xyleborini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ambrosia beetles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9295.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ambrosia beetles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9294.phy"}]}
