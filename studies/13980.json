Two new genera are proposed,\nAlloconiothyrium, to accommodate A. aptrootii sp. nov., and\nDendrothyrium, for D. longisporum sp. nov. and D. variisporum sp. nov.\nOne new species is described in Paraconiothyrium, viz. Parac.\narchidendri sp. nov., while two species so far classified in\nParaconiothyrium are transferred to Paraphaeosphaeria, viz. Paraph.\nminitans comb. nov. and Paraph. sporulosa comb. nov. In\nParaphaeosphaeria five new species are described based on asexual\nmorphs, viz. Paraph. arecacearum sp. nov., Paraph. neglecta sp. nov.,\nParaph. sardoa sp. nov., Paraph. verruculosa sp. nov., and Paraph.\nviridescens sp. nov. Macro- and micromorphological characteristics are\nfully described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63277","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63277.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63278","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63278.phy"}]}
