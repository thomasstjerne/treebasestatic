To revaluate and delimit the genus Conidiobolus,\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed using the large and\nsmall subunits of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nucLSU and nucSSU), the small\nsubunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (mtSSU) and the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α). The result indicated that the\nConidiobolus was not monophyletic, being grouped into a paraphyletic\ngrade with four clades. Consequently, the wellknown Conidiobolus was\nrejected, while the genus Delacroixia was recognized and three new\ngenera Capillidium, Microconidiobolus and Neoconidiobolus were proposed\nalong with two new species, one new record and 34 new combinations. In\naddition, the genus Basidiobolus is found to be basal to the other\nentomophthoroid taxa and the genus Batkoa should be located in the\nEntomophthoraceae clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118355","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118355.phy"}]}
