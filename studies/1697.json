The first\nclade, comprising Anagallis arvensis, A. foemina, A. monelli,\nAsterolinon, Pelletiera, Lysimachia nemorum, and L. serpyllifolia is\nsupported by synapomorphies such as an annual, repeatedly branching\nhabit, sessile leaves, flowers in almost all leaf axils, and membranous\nslightly dentate calyx margins, of which all but the last are\nhomoplasious within Anagallis s.l.. The second clade, comprising\nAnagallis species only, is supported by a large number of\nsynapomorphies, of which the majority are floral features. Placement of\nten taxa, for which no DNA was available, is proposed based on\nmorphological characters evaluated in the light of the result of the\nphylogenetic analysis of sequenced taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anagallis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4727.phy"}]}
