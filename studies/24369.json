In order to establish\nFomitiporella s.s., studies on the holotype of F. umbrinella (the type\nspecies of Fomitiporella), and new specimens from the type locality,\nwere carried out. A new morphological conceptual delimitation of\nFomitiporella s.s. is presented, with a more restricted distribution\npattern and Fuscoporella is considered a synonym of Fomitiporella.\nMoreover, Rajchenbergia gen. nov. is segregated from Fomitiporella s.l.\nbased on morphology, phylogenetic relationships and host distribution.\nTaxonomic implications for the group and other related taxa are\ndiscussed. Fomitiporella americana is synonymized with F. umbrinella, F.\nmicropora with F. coruscans comb. nov. and F. melleopora is now in\nTropicoporus melleoporus comb. nov., based on type and reference\nmaterial studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporella s.l.
