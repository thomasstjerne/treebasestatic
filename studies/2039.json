Two hypotheses on\nthe isolated evolutionary origin of syncarpy in two African Annonaceae\ngenera, Monodora and Isolona, were tested: multiplication of a single\ncarpel vs.Â fusion of a moderate number of carpels. In addition, the\nevolution of six morphological characters was studied. The Bayesian\nposterior mapping approach was used to account for mapping and\nphylogenetic uncertainty and allow multiple changes along the branches.\nThe exact phylogenetic relationships of Monodora and Isolona were\nelucidated by including all closely related genera. Six chloroplast\nregions were sequenced and analyzed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference methods. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that\nsyncarpy arose by fusion of an ancestrally moderate number of carpels.\nIn addition, a well supported African clade comprising 12 endemic\nAfrican genera nested within the long-branch clade was recovered. The\nresults presented here provide a better understanding on the evolution\nof syncarpy in Annonaceae and within angiosperms in general.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Max Clade Credibility","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_364.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5152.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5153.phy"},{"tree_label":"Con Strict","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5154.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 3","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5155.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 6","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5156.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 4","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5157.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 5","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5158.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT PAUP 7","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5159.phy"},{"tree_label":"majrul","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Annonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5160.phy"}]}
