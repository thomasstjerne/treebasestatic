(Arecaceae) from Khuan Ka Long, Satun\nProvince, Thailand. This Berkleasmium species differs morphologically\nfrom other species in possessing subtending cells and larger conidia.\nThe phylogenetic relationship of the genus Berkleasmium among sexual\nascomycetes was also examined. Sequence analyses from 18S, 28S and\nITS-5.8S rDNA were analysed phylogenetically under maximum parsimony,\nbayesian and neighbour- joining criteria. Phylogenies revealed that\nBerkleasmium is not monophyletic. Berkleasmium micronesicum and B.\nnigroapicale are phylogenetically related to Westerdykella cylindrica\nand Sporormia australis, which are members of the family Sporormiaceae\n(Pleosporales). Other species, including our new taxon, appear to share\nclose phylogenetic affinities to other anamorphic fungi, whose\nclassification within the Pleosporales are still obscure. Analyses also\nindicate that the 18S, 28S, ITS (+5.8S) rDNA and combined data (18S+28S)\ngene sequences fail to give enough phylogenetic resolution within the\nPleosporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_986.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_987.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_988.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_989.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berkleasmium crunisia sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_991.phy"}]}
