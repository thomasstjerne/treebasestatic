The present paper summarises the\ntaxonomic history and the various clades that have been named informally\nin phylogenetic studies. Based on published studies, our own\ncomprehensive phylogenetic analyses, and consensus among a number of\nGnaphalieae taxonomists we suggest a subdivision of the tribe into two\nsubtribes. These are a largely African endemic Relhaniinae and a vastly\nenlarged Gnaphaliinae, the latter accounting for more than 90% of the\nspecies diversity. Although a finer division may be desirable, there are\nat present several obstacles to such a classification, in particular\ncontradictory or ambiguous inferences of relationships within the\nGnaphaliinae and the nested position of its largest putative\nclades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ribo RAxML GTRCAT","ntax":"721","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112405.phy"}]}
