This family is poorly understood both in of\nmorphological characters and there have been few phylogenetic studies.\nThis paper deals with three new species, i.e.Â Ceramothyrium\nthailandicum, Chaetothyrium brischofiacola and Phaeosaccardinula ficus\nwhich are fully described and illustrated. A DNA sequence analyses of\nLSU rDNA genes shows that the new species cluster in the\nChaetothyriaceae. This paper adds six sequences for Chaetothyriaceae to\nGenBank providing much needed data for the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetothyriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48727.phy"}]}
