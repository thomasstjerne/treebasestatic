The sequences\nof four genetic regions from these groups were analysed to compare the\nextent of differences between these species; between isolates that were\ncollected from Europe compared to those from North America; and between\nisolates of M. nivale originally collected from Agrostis spp. compared\nto isolates collected on wheat (Triticum aestivum). The four regions\nstudied were RPB2 (RNA polymerase II), β-tubulin, EF-1α (elongation\nfactor), and ITS (rDNA internal transcribed spacer). All of the regions\nstudied except for ITS resolved the M. nivale and M. majus isolates into\nseparate clades. The RPB2 sequences also resolved both the North\nAmerican and European M.majus isolates and M. nivale isolates from\neither turfgrasses or wheat into separate clades. These results support\nthe recent elevation of M. nivale and M. majus to sister species, and\nalso provide some support for the assertion that there may be\nhost-specific differences among M. nivale, which has a wider host range\nthan M. majus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML EF1a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML EF1a","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54989.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ EF1a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ EF1a","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54991.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP EF1a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP EF1a","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54990.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP ITS","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54930.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML RPB2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML RPB2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54986.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP RPB2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP RPB2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54987.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ RPB2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ RPB2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54988.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ Btub","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ Btub","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54928.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Btub","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP Btub","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54927.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML ITS","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54929.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ ITS","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54931.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Btub","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML Btub","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54926.phy"}]}
