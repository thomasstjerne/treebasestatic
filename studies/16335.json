They are described and illustrated\nhere as a new species, Hydnocristella latihypha, based on a combination\nof morphological characters and rDNA sequences data. The new species is\ncharacterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate and hydnoid\nbasidiocarps, a monomitic hyphal structure with clamped generative\nhyphae, wide tramal hyphae, and smooth fusiform basidiospores measured\nas 10.2â“12.2 Â´ 4.2â“5.5 Âµm. In the phylogenetic perspective, H.\nlatihypha is closely related to H. himantia, the generic type, and\nnested within the Lentariaceae clade, but the latter species has narrow\ntramal hyphae and smaller basidiospores measured as 8â“10 Ã 4â“5\nÂµm.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule Con","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnocristella MP0","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79387.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnocristella BT0","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79386.phy"}]}
