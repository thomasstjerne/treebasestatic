They cause pine\nneedle rust, and well-known rust diseases on frangipani and species of\nAsteraceae. Coleosporium asterum, a rust fungus originally described\nfrom Japan, has an unresolved taxonomy in North America and may form a\nspecies complex. A systematic analysis using two ribosomal DNA gene\nregions was conducted to determine the relationships among species of\nColeosporium, including C. asterum. Two phylogenetically distinct groups\nof C. asterum were recovered that represent different species in the\nUnited States. Coleosporium solidaginis, which was first described on\nSolidago (Asteraceae) in the southeastern United States, is emended to\nresolve a part of this complex. The challenges of marker selection for\nmolecular identification and phylogenetic studies of rust fungi are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coleosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115917.phy"}]}
