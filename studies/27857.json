In Mexico, this grass\ngrows mainly during the rainy season, along railways and roadsides, and\nin abandoned fields and urban communities. Significantly, it competes\nwith a wide range of crops during the fall-winter season. Recently, a\nhigh incidence of severe leaf spot was observed on Johnson grass in\nnorthern Sinaloa, Mexico. The aim of this study was to identify the\ncausal agent of this leaf spot based on morphology and molecular\ntechniques, and to determine the pathogenicity of the fungal isolates\nassociated with the disease. Our phylogenetic analysis of the gapdh gene\ngrouped the sequences of ten fungal isolates from Johnson grass with\nCurvularia muehlenbeckiae. Morphometric analyses agree with the\nmolecular identification of all ten isolates included in the study.\nInoculation tests under greenhouse conditions demonstrated the\npathogenicity of C. muehlenbeckiae in Johnson grass. Leaf spots\ndisplayed in the inoculated plants were similar to those observed under\nfield conditions and in two independent inoculation tests. This is the\nfirst report implicating C. muehlenbeckiae as a causal agent of leaf\nspot on Johnson grass in México.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129344","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129344.phy"}]}
