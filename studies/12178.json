A systematic\nanalysis using three rDNA loci was conducted to determine the\nrelationships among species of Coleosporium, including C. asterum. Two\nphylogenetically distant groups of C. asterum were recovered that\nrepresent different species in the United States, neither of which\nappear to be conspecific with the Asiatic species. Coleosporium\nkanekoium is described to accommodate a monophyletic group on Solidago\n(Asteraceae) within the southeastern United States. Coleosporium asterum\nremains a species complex within the United States and Asia. This study\nillustrates species delimitation in Coleosporium cannot be defined\nsolely by host, spore morphology or a single rDNA locus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50057","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50057.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50058.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50056","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50056.phy"}]}
