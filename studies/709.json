The generic concept based on\nthis morphological difference was re-evaluated using three molecular\nmarkers, mt SSU rDNA, nu LSU rDNA, and the nu ITS region. The analysis\nof the ITS region does not provide sufficient resolution within the\nCoccotremataceae, while the other two data sets contradict the current\ngeneric concept. The mt SSU and nu LSU data sets and the combined\nanalysis of the two data sets all place Lepolichen within Coccotrema.\nHowever, an alternative topology with monophyleticCoccotrema cannot be\nrejected when the ITS data set is included in the combined analyses.\nThis shortcoming of the ITS data set can be overcome by the combined\nanalysis of all three data sets, where monophyletic Coccotrema can be\nrejected using parametric bootstrapping, as in the mt SSU and nu LSU\ndata sets (and combination thereof). It is proposed to reduceLepolichen\ninto synonymy with Coccotrema. The correct name for the only species\npreviously placed inLepolichen is Coccotrema coccophorum (Mont.)
