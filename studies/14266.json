Evolutionary relationships among Old world sciaenids and\norigin have remained unresolved despite their diversity and importance.\nPrevious investigations of sciaenids phylogeny, based primarily on\nmorphological data or molecular data, have been unsuccessful at\nelucidating these relationships. Besides, hypotheses that explain the\norigin and biogeography distribution of sciaenids are controversial, and\nthe evolutionary scenario for this group was unclear.","trees":[{"tree_label":"A reference tree file in the ancestral distribution\nanalysis","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sciaenids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63647.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum likelihood tree of New world and Old world\nsciaenids","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sciaenids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63653.phy"}]}
