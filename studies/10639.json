Fine-scale local adaptation has been hypothesized to\noccur in armoured scale insects (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) and a\nconsequence of this process may be multiple cryptic species. We estimate\nspecies diversity of pine-feeding Chionaspis scale insects across North\nAmerica by inferring species boundaries using genealogical concordance\nacross allele genealogies of two nuclear loci and one mitochondrial\nlocus. Our ingroup sample includes 366 individual insects from 320\nlocalities and 51 host species within the Pinaceae. We also conducted a\nmorphological survey of all insect specimens and assigned them as either\none of the two currently recognized pine-feeding species, Ch.\nheterophyllae, Ch. Pinifoliae, or with undescribed morphology. Using\nmaximum likelihood allele genealogies in a majority-rule consensus to\nassess congruence, we conservatively detect ten species in this group.\nMost of these species are robust to alternative methods of genealogical\ninference (Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony) and a few are robust\nto the use of strict consensus to assess congruence. Species show both\nnarrow and more widespread ranges where almost half of the individuals\nsampled belong to a single very widespread polyphagous species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood rDNA28s","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9850","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9850.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood EF-1a","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9851","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9851.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood COI-COII","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9849","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood Majority Rule consensus tree of all\n3 loci","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9853","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9853.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9857","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9857.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9858","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9858.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9859","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9859.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9860","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9860.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood strict consensus tree of all 3\nloci","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9854","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9854.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9865","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9866","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9866.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9868","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9869","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9869.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9861","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9861.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9862","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9862.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9863","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9863.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9864","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9864.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"374","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9867","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9867.phy"}]}
