In 2010, an\ninvestigation of mango plantations in Egypt resulted in the isolation of\n26 Lasiodiplodia isolates that, based on previous reports from\nliterature, were tentatively identified as L. theobromae. The aim of\nthis study was to clarify the taxonomy of these isolates based on\nmorphology and DNA sequence data (ITS and EF1-α). In addition to L.\ntheobromae, a new species, namely L. egypticae, was identified.\nFurthermore, L. pseudotheobromae is also newly recorded on mango in\nEgypt. Pathogenicity tests with all recognised species showed that they\nare able to cause dieback disease symptoms on mango seedlings.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia Species Associated Dieback in Mango","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57551.phy"}]}
