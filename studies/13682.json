While\nseveral papers have reviewed the methods and potential applications of\nDNA barcoding, most have focused on species identification and\ndiscovery, and relatively few have addressed applications of DNA\nbarcoding data to ecology. These data, and the associated information on\nthe evolutionary histories of taxa that they can provide, offer great\nopportunities for ecologists to investigate questions that were\npreviously difficult or impossible to address. We present an overview of\npotential uses of DNA barcoding relevant in the age of ecoinformatics,\nincluding applications in community ecology, species invasion,\nmacroevolution, trait evolution, food webs and trophic interactions,\nmetacommunities, and spatial ecology. We also outline some of the\nchallenges and potential advances in DNA barcoding that lie ahead.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukaryote tree of life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60727.phy"}]}
