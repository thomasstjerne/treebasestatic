Zoonotic infections in humans are rare, but when they occur\nthey are often severe and difficult to treat. One of the most studied\nproteins from this bacterium, the secreted protein CP40 is being\ndeveloped as a promising vaccine candidate and has been characterized as\na serine protease. In this study we have investigated if CP40 is an\nendoglycosidase rather than a protease. RESULTS:CP40 does not show any\nprotease activity and contains an EndoS-like family 18 of glycoside\nhydrolase (chitinase) motif. It hydrolyzes biantennary glycans on both\nhuman and ovine IgGs. CP40 is not a general chitinase and cannot\nhydrolyze bisecting GlcNAc. CONCLUSION:Taken together we present solid\nevidence for re-annotating CP40 as an EndoS-like endoglycosidase.\nRedefining the activity of this enzyme will facilitate subsequent\nstudies that could give further insight into immune evasion mechanisms\nunderlying corynebacterial infections in animals and humans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PhyloTree","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis NJ CP40","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99108.phy"}]}
