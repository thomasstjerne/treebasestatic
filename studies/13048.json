Acristavus is amember of the newly\nerected clade Brachylophosaurini, which along with its other members,\nBrachylophosaurus and Maiasaura, constitutes the earliest hadrosaurine\nhadrosaurid clade. The new taxon occurred approximately 79 million years\nago and has been recovered from the Two Medicine Formation of western\nMontana and nearly simultaneously in theWahweap Formation of southern\nUtah. Corresponding with its age and relationship to the other members\nof the Brachylophosaurini, it is not surprising that Acristavus\npossesses traits seen in both Brachylophosaurus and Maiasaura, but not\nnecessarily shared between them. One of themost interesting\nmorphological features of Acristavus is the lack of cranial osteological\nornamentation, which is in stark contrast to every other hadrosaurid\ndinosaur except Edmontosaurus. Combining stratigraphic and phylogenetic\ndata from Acristavus yields support for the hypothesis that the\nhadrosaurid ancestor did not possess cranial ornamentation, and that the\nsubfamilies Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae each independently\ndeveloped display structures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Hadrosauridae results","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55328.phy"}]}
