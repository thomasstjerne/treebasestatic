We assess the\nimpact of the Andean orogeny, drainage of lake Pebas, and closure of the\nPanama Isthmus on two clades of trees (Cremastosperma, c. 31 spp.; and\nMosannona, c. 14 spp.; both Annonaceae) found in humid forest\ndistributed across the transition zones between the Andes and Western\n(lowland) Amazonia and between Central and South America. We inferred\nphylogenies based on c. 80% of recognised species of each clade and\nplastid and nuclear encoded sequence markers, revealing similar patterns\nof geographically restricted clades. Using molecular dating we showed\nthat the timing of diversifications in the different areas largely\noverlap and are consistent with Andean vicariance and Central American\ngeodispersal. In apparent contradiction of high dispersal abilities of\nrainforest trees, Cremastosperma clades within Amazonia are also\ngeographically restricted, with a southern/montane clade that appears to\nhave diversified in the foothills of the Andes sister to one of more\nnorthern/lowland species that diversified in a region once inundated by\nlake Pebas. Ecological niche modelling approaches show niche\nconservatism, particularly within Cremastosperma. Niche similarity and\nrecent common ancestry of Amazon and Guianan Mosannona species contrasts\nwith dissimilar niches and more distant ancestry of Amazon, Venezuelan\nand Guianan species of Cremastosperma suggesting that this element of\nthe similar patterns of disjunct distributions in the two genera had\ndifferent biogeographic origins. The results provide further independent\nevidence for the importance of the Andean orogeny, the drainage of Lake\nPebas, and the formation of links between South and Central America in\nthe evolutionary history of Neotropical lowland rainforest trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BEAST Old","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malmeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110072.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Recent","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malmeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110071.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes ndhF","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma ndhJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110073.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsim all","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars all","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosannona","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes all","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110077.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsim ndhF","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma ndhJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110075.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML all","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars ndhF","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosannona 17 taxa ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes all","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosannona","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110085.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML ndhF","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cremastosperma ndhJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110074.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes ndhF","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosannona 17 taxa ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110082.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML ndhF","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosannona 17 taxa ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110084.phy"}]}
