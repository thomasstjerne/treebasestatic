We also examined\nrelationships within Adoxaceae using rbcL and nuclear ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) sequences. We conclude from these analyses that\nDipsacales comprise two major lineages: Adoxaceae and Caprifoliaceae\n(sensu Judd et al., 1994), which both contain elements of traditional\nCaprifoliaceae. Within Adoxaceae, the following relationships are\nstrongly supported: (Viburnum, (Sambucus, (Sinadoxa, (Tetradoxa,\nAdoxa)))). Combined analyses of Caprifoliaceae yield the following:\n(Caprifolieae (Diervilleae (Linnaeeae (Morinaceae (Dipsacaceae\n(Triplostegia, Valerianaceae)))))). On the basis of these results we\nprovide phylogenetic definitions for the names of several major clades.\nWithin Adoxaceae, Adoxina refers to the clade including Sinadoxa,\nTetradoxa, and Adoxa. This lineage is marked by herbaceous habit,\nreduction in the number of perianth parts, nectaries of multicellular\nhairs on the perianth, and bifid stamens. The clade including\nMorinaceae, Valerianaceae, Triplostegia, and Dipsacaceae is here named\nValerina. Probable synapomorphies include herbaceousness, presence of an\nepicalyx (lost or modified in Valerianaceae), reduced endosperm, and\ndistinctive chemistry, including production of monoterpenoids. The clade\ncontaining Valerina plus Linnaeeae we name Linnina. This lineage is\ndistinguished by reduction to four (or fewer) stamens, by abortion of\ntwo of the three carpels, and possibly by supernumerary inflorescences\nbracts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5791.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5789.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5790.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5792.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5793.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5794.phy"}]}
