Cases of severe,\nproliferative dermatitis, debility and death have been detected in\nmultiple free-living lizard species from locations across Australia,\nincluding a substantial outbreak among Eastern water dragons\n(Intellagama lesueurii) in Brisbane, Queensland. We investigated this\ndisease in a subset of severely affected lizards and identified a\nclinically consistent syndrome characterized by hyperkeratosis,\nepidermal hyperplasia, dermal inflammation, necrosis, ulceration, and\nemaciation. Using a novel fungal isolation method, histopathology, and\nmolecular techniques, we identified the etiologic agent as Nannizziopsis\nbarbatae, a species reported only once previously from captive lizards\nin Australia. Here we report severe dermatomycosis caused by N. barbatae\nin five species of Australian lizard, representing the first cases of\nNannizziopsis infection among free-living reptiles, globally. Further,\nwe evaluate key pathogen and host characteristics that indicate N.\nbarbatae-associated dermatomycosis may pose a concerning threat to\nAustralian lizards.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootstrap
