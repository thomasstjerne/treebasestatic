Its systematic identity\nwas here studied using morphological and DNA sequence data of the\nchloroplast gene regions of rbcL, rps4 and trnL-F. Thirty-seven\nexemplars including eight of Cyanolophocolea echinella, 27 of\nLophocoleaceae and two of Plagiochilaceae were used for phylogenetic\nreconstruction using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference\nmethods. Our analyses placed Cyanolophocolea echinella within\nHeteroscyphus with strong support.Heteroscyphus echinellus (Lindenb.\n& Gottsche) J.J.Engel & He-Nygrén is proposed and based on\nmorphological variations two varieties var. echinellus and var. hyalinus\nJ.J.Engel are recognized. A large indel (59 base pairs) and one\nsubstitution in the trnL intron region, and also one substitution in the\nintergenic spacer region were found in the trnL-F in two Cyanolophocolea\nechinella exemplars both with hyaline oil-bodies. This indicates rapid\nmolecular evolution might have likely occurred within the species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyanolophocolea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6564.phy"}]}
