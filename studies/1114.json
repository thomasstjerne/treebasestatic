Phylogenetically they belong to the Urediniomycetidae, therefore\nbeing closely related to their rust fungal hosts. We reveal by means of\nmolecular analyses, ultrastructural and morphological features,\nobservations in the field, and infection experiments that species of the\ngenus Tuberculina and the violet root rot (Helicobasidium/Rhizoctonia\ncrocorum) are stages of the life cycle of one holomorph. This opens up\nnew perspectives on parasitic life strategies as the resulting life\ncycle is based on interkingdom host jumping between rusts and\nspermatophytes. In addition, we point at the consequences for any\npractical application dealing with Helicobasidium as an economically\nimportant plant pathogen and Tuberculina as a biological agent in rust\ncontrol.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helicobasidium/Tuberculina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1714.phy"}]}
