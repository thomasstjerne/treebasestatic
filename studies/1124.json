Insights from plastid\nand nuclear sequence data.","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Eragrostis is a large genus of grasses in subfamily\nChloridoideae of the Poaceae. Recent phylogenetic analyses have\nsuggested that the group may not be monophyletic, and there are a number\nof segregate genera that may be better placed within Eragrostis. We have\nused molecular sequence data from the plastid locus rps16 and the\nnuclear gene waxy from a broad sample of Eragrostis species and\nrepresentatives of six of the seven segregate genera to address these\nissues. We find that Eragrostis is a monophyletic group with the\ninclusion of four segregate genera: Acamptoclados, Diandrochloa,\nNeeragrostis, and Pogonarthria. The placement of Cladoraphis and\nStiburus is uncertain. Thellungia does not belong in Eragrostis and is\nactually more closely related to Sporobolus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1 rps16","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eragrostis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1740.phy"},{"tree_label":"t1waxy","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eragrostis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1741.phy"}]}
