A recent examination of the mat revealed the\npresence of a boring filamentous form that when grown on agar “drilled”\nthrough the agar. A comparison to the genus Oxynema revealed several\ndifferences including clockwise and counter clockwise movement in\naddition to oscillating movement atypical of any known taxa. The taxon\nproduces three novel toxins including the kulokekahailde 2, malyngamide\n1, and dehydro-apratoxin-A. We propose establishment of a new family,\ngenus and species Perforafilum tunnelli based on morphology, and\npolyphasic genomic analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"313","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115940","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115940.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"313","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115941","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115941.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"313","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115942","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115944","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115944.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115945","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115945.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"313","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perforafilum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115939.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perforafilum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115943.phy"}]}
