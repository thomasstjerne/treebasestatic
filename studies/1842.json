In the\nFlora of Australia (Telford 1982), all four species were provisionally\nincluded in Mukia, but not formally described. Austrobryonia\nargillicola, A. centralis, A. micrantha, and A. pilbarensis are adapted\nto arid central regions of Australia; all species are known from several\n(7-27) localities, and their distributional ranges are allopatric. A\nphylogenetic analysis of plastid and nuclear DNA sequences that includes\nall four species in a family-wide context revealed that Austrobryonia is\nthe closest living relative to a Eurasian and Mediterranean clade\nconsisting of Bryonia L. and Ecballium L. An rbcL molecular clock,\ncalibrated with Cucurbitaceae fossils, dates this rare biogeographic\ndisjunction to minimally 42 my ago (with an error of c. ± 25%), while\nthe crown group of Austrobryonia may be about 8 my old.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Austrobryonia, plastid data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Austrobryonia, nuclear data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2812.phy"}]}
