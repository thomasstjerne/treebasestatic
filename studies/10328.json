Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses including representatives of all American genera\nof Atripliceae and data from 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal (ITS, ETS) and\nchloroplast (3Â’trnK intron) DNA sequences suggest that neither Atriplex,\nas traditionally recognized, nor the North American members of Atriplex\nconstitute a monophyletic group. Congruence between well-supported\nnuclear and chloroplast clades and results of expanded leaf anatomical\nand isotopic analyses indicate that American taxa belong to two\ndistantly related lineages with different photosynthetic pathways; only\none shift from C3 to C4 photosynthesis is required to explain\nphotosynthetic pathway evolution in sampled lineages of Atripliceae.\nConservatism in photosynthetic pathway evolution in the tribe is\nexemplified by the endemic, C3 North American Atriplex taxa, which are\nnested among other genera (e.g., Grayia, Holmbergia, Zuckia) within a\nrobust C3 clade. One North American C3 genus, Suckleya, often included\nwithin Atripliceae should be excluded from the tribe. A previous\nhypothesis of variation in photosynthetic pathway within Atriplex\nphyllostegia sensu H. M. Hall and Clem. is rejected. A revised taxonomy\nemploying only monophyletic groups reflects this new understanding of\nrelationships within the tribe. Extriplex includes E. californica (comb.\nnov.) and E. joaquinana (comb. nov.) and has not been recognized as a\nnatural group by previous authors. Stutzia is proposed to replace the\nname Endolepis Torr. (1860), a later homonym of Endolepis Schleid.\n(1846), and includes S. covillei (comb. nov.) and S. dioica (comb.\nnov.). Grayia (G. plummeri, comb. nov., and G. arizonica, comb. nov.) is\nexpanded to include Zuckia. Recognition of Proatriplex as distinct from\nAtriplex is supported. Holmbergia is retained in Atripliceae. The\nimproved phylogenetic understanding of Atripliceae should allow for more\nmeaningful comparative studies of physiological and other functional\nadaptations of Atriplex, especially in North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7825.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7827.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7826.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7828.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_trnK_3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7837.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_trnK_2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7836.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_trnK_4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7838.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7831.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_trnK_1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7835.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_8","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7833.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML_ITS_ETS_trnK","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7834.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_ITS_ETS_1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7824.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7830.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_7","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7832.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP_trnK_4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"North American Atripliceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7829.phy"}]}
