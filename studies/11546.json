Genes from ATPase subunit 6\n(atp6), the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA (nuc-LSU), and the\nsecond largest RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) underwent Bayesian and\nparsimony molecular analyses. Molecular datasets, combined with\nmorphological characters, support a new genus (Abrachium for Aseroe\nfloriformis), reassessment of Itajahya, and emendation of\nClathraceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales Maximum Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46186.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46184.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallales Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46185.phy"}]}
