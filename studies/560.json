On the basis of these\ndata and 38 sequences obtained from GenBank, phylogenetic analyses were\nperformed using the programs PAUP and Pee-Wee. Hypomyces appears to be\nparaphyletic, with species having wet-conidial phialidic anamorphs more\nclosely related to other genera. Hypomyces chrysostomus is a sister\ngroup to the clade that includes species of Aphysiostroma, Arachnocrea\nand Hypocrea. Based on morphological and molecular evidence, a new\ngenus, Sporophagomyces, is described for Hypomyces chrysostomus and two\nallied species. Hypomyces broomeanus forms one clade with species of\nSphaerostilbella and is transferred to this genus. The recognition of\nArachnocrea is justified. The integration of Cladobotryum species that\nare not known to undergo sexual reproduction with Hypomyces species that\npossess Cladobotryum anamorphs receives strong support but the whole\ncomplex of these species appears to be paraphyletic. Constraint trees,\nwhich require monophyly of all these ana- and pleomorphic species,\nappears significantly less likely than the other trees obtained under\nmaximum likelihood or parsimony criteria. For the remaining species of\nHypomyces, four distinct lineages are distinguished.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Large set, strict consensus","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3465.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreaceae, intermediate set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3466.phy"},{"tree_label":"Small set, strict consensus","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreaceae, small set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3467.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreaceae, small set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3468.phy"},{"tree_label":"Small set, maximum likelihood","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreaceae, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3469.phy"}]}
