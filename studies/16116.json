In this study,\nphylogenetic relationships were explored using amplified fragment length\npolymorphism (AFLP) data in comparison with a phylogeny based on\nchloroplast DNA sequences, with an emphasis on Arundinaria of North\nAmerica and its allies in East Asia (the Arundinaria clade). Molecular\nanalyses involved 248 individuals in 10 genera and 60 species.\nHybridization was detected both within and among genera. Comparative\nanalyses indicated hybrid origins for species in several widespread and\nwell-known genera, including Hibanobambusa, Sasaella, and\nSemiarundinaria. Evidence also indicated that Pseudosasa japonica (the\ntype species of Pseudosasa) is an intergeneric hybrid involving\nPleioblastus and Sasamorpha. In addition, cryptic hybrids were detected\nwithin and among Pleioblastus, Sasa, and Sasamorpha. After accounting\nfor hybrids, phylogenetic analyses of AFLP data provided resolution for\ncore lineages in the Arundinaria clade, including Pleioblastus sensu\nstricto, Sasa s.s., and Sasamorpha. AFLP data also provided evidence for\nthe monophyly of the North American cane bamboos (Arundinaria, 3 spp.)\nbut failed to identify their closest relative among the East Asian taxa.\nThe broader evolutionary implications of hybridization in the temperate\nbamboos are discussed along with recommendations for future\nstudies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"AFLP_PLEIO_92","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae AFLP_PLEIO_92","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76476.phy"},{"tree_label":"AFLP_202_Taxa","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae AFLP_202_Taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76474.phy"},{"tree_label":"AFLP_53_taxa","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae AFLP_53_taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76472.phy"},{"tree_label":"AFLP_PLEIO_131","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae AFLP_PLEIO_131","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76475.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA_55_taxa","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae cpDNA_55_taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76473.phy"},{"tree_label":"AFLP_56_taxa","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arundinarieae AFLP_56_taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76477.phy"}]}
