The occurrence of post-harvest diseases prevent its\nsale and change the taste, making it inappropriate for consumption. In\n2011, coconut fruits showing internal post-harvest rot symptoms were\nfound in a market in Belo Horizonte and after incubation for 5 days in a\nhumid chamber at room temperature, fungal structures were observed.\nFruiting structures show morphology typical of Ceratocystis paradoxa.\nFor molecular identifcation, DNA sequences were generated for the\nInternal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rRNA\ngene, part of the Î²-tubulin and the Transcription Elongation Factor\n1-Î± gene regions. These data were compared with those of other C.\nparadoxa using phylogenetic analysis. Kochâs postulates was confrmed by\ninoculation of 6-mm-diameter PDA plugs with the isolate on fruits of\ncoconut. Morphology of the isolates in culture as well as phylogenetic\ninference showed that the causal agent of internal post-harvest rot\ndisease on coconut is C. paradoxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratocystis paradoxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52347.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratocystis paradoxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52346.phy"}]}
