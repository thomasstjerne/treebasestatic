ITS and partial\ntranslation elongation factor 1-รก sequence data were analysed to\ninvestigate their phylogenetic relationships with other closely related\nspecies and genera. The four new species formed well-supported clades\nwithin Lasiodiplodia and were morphologically distinct from all other\nknown species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6716.phy"}]}
