Previous studies\nhave mainly focused on coral reef or shallow water- associated taxa.\nHere, we present the first attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary\nhistory − phylogeny, diversification and biogeography − of a deep water\nlineage. We sequenced the molecular markers 16S, COI, ND1, 18S and 28S\nfor nearly 80% of the nominal species of the squat lobster genus\nParamunida. Analyses of the molecular phylogeny revealed an accelerated\ndiversification in the late Oligocene-Miocene followed by a slowdown in\nthe rate of lineage accumulation over time. A parametric biogeographical\nreconstruction showed the importance of the SW Pacific area,\nspecifically the island arc of Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna,\nfor diversification of squat lobsters, probably associated with the\nglobal warming, high tectonic activity, and changes in oceanic currents\nthat took place in this region during the Oligocene-Miocene period.\nThese results add strong evidence to the hypothesis that the Neogene was\na period of major diversification for marine organisms in both shallow\nand deep waters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Mitochondrial dataset Bootstrap","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mitochondrial Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mitochondrial dataset Phylogram","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mitochondrial Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear dataset Phylogram","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nuclear Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50180.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined dataset Phylogram","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50181.phy"},{"tree_label":"Nuclear dataset Boostrap","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nuclear Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50179.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined dataset Bootstrap","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined Paramunida Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50182.phy"}]}
