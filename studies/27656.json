Phlebiella wuliangshanensis is characterized by\nannual, resupinate basidiomata with pruinose to farinaceous to\ngrandinoid hymenial surface, a monomitic hyphal system with clamped\ngenerative hyphae and subglobose, thin-walled, warted basidiospores\n(2.83.5 × 2.53 µm). Sequences of ITS gene regions of the studied samples\nwere generated. The phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data of ITS\nsequences supported the novelty of these two species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134683","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134683.phy"}]}
