It is\na member of Polystichum sect. Haplopolystichum (Dryopteridaceae). A\nphylogenetic analysis based on chloroplast trnL-F sequences suggests\nthat the new species is most closely related to P. cavernicola, P.\nminutissimum, and P. speluncicola, species described from karst caves in\nadjacent southern Guizhou. Morphologically, P. fengshanense can be\neasily distinguished from these three species by having narrow-type\nmicroscales on the abaxial laminar surface, sessile pinnae, and sori\ncloser to the midrib. Palynologically, P. fengshanense has granulate\nperispore sculpturing, whereas P. cavernicola has verrucate perispore\nsculpturing and P. speluncicola has cristate perispore sculpturing with\nnumerous spinules. Polystichum fengshanense is considered to be\nCritically Endangered (CR) based on IUCN Red List criteria because of\nits restricted distribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polystichum fengshanense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44908.phy"}]}
