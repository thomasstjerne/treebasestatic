These results suggested that the phylogeographic\npatterns of H. diversicolor could reflect interactions between cryptic\ndifferentiation and multiple colonisation events. This study aims to\ndescribe the large scale genetic structuring of H. diversicolor and to\ntrace the phylogeographic origins of the genetic types described in the\nBaltic Sea. Samples of H. diversicolor (2 < n < 28) were collected\nat 16 locations across the NE Atlantic coasts of Europe and Morocco and\nin the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas and sequenced at two\nmitochondrial gene fragments (COI and cytb, 345 and 290 bp,\nrespectively). Bayesian analyses revealed deep phylogeographic splits\nyielding three main clades corresponding to populations a) from the NE\nAtlantic coasts (from Germany to Morocco) and from part of the Western\nMediterranean, b) from the Mediterranean Sea and c) from the Black and\nCaspian Seas. These clades are further divided in well supported\nsubclades including populations from different regions of NE Atlantic\nand Mediterranean (i.e.Â Portugal/Morocco, Western Mediterranean,\nAdriatic Sea). The Baltic Sea comprises three sympatric lineages sharing\na common evolutionary history with populations from NE Atlantic, Western\nMediterranean and Black/Caspian Seas, respectively. Hence, the current\npatterns of genetic structuring of H. diversicolor appear the result of\nallopatric isolation, multiple colonisation events and possible\nadaptation to local environmental conditions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cytb midpoint","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6021.phy"},{"tree_label":"concatenated midpoint","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6128.phy"},{"tree_label":"concatenated Neanthes virens","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6066.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI Neanthes virens","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6297.phy"},{"tree_label":"cytb Nereis pelagica","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6023.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Bayesian","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6168.phy"},{"tree_label":"cytb Neanthes virens","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6022.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6123.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI midpoint concat data","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6295.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI Hediste japonica","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Hediste diversicolor","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6296.phy"}]}
