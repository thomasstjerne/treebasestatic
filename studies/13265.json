The holotype is a\npartially articulated skeleton of an adult individual recovered from the\nArsis-1 site in Peñarroya de Tastavins (Teruel) at the base of the\nmarine Xert Formation. It is one of the most complete and best-\npreserved sauropod dinosaur skeletons from the European Early\nCretaceous. The fossil remains comprise the three caudalmost thoracic\nvertebrae, part of a fourth, nine thoracic rib fragments, sacrum, 25\ncaudal vertebrae, 21 chevrons, both ilia, pubes, ischia and femora,\nright tibia, right fibula, six metatarsals, and seven pedal phalanges\n(including four unguals). The new taxon is defined by 19 autapomorphies.\nIn our cladistic analysis, Tastavinsaurus is the sister-taxon of the\nNorth American Venenosaurus within Titanosauriformes, which includes the\nBrachiosauridae, Somphospondyli, and Titanosauria. The new taxon\nprovides new information about the diversity of non-brachiosaurid\ntitanosauriforms during the Early Cretaceous in Europe and\npaleobiogeographic relationships between Europe and North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 18","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56091.phy"}]}
