The ethicus group contains six species from\nSouth America. Anelosimus rabus Levi, 1963, A. ethicus (Keyserling,\n1884), and A. nigrescens (Keyserling, 1884) are redescribed, and A.\nnigrescens here removed from synonymy with A. ethicus. Three new species\nis described A. misiones sp. n. from southern Brazil and Argentina, and\nA. sumisolena sp. n. and A. inhandava sp. n. from southern Brazil.\nAnelosimus ethicus is reportedly either subsocial or solitary, while the\nbehavior of the other species in the ethicus group is unknown. The\nrupununi group contains two quasisocial species, A. rupununi Levi, 1956,\nand A. lorenzo Fowler & Levi, 1979 from tropical South America that\nare redescribed. A parsimony analysis of morphological characters\nprovides support for the monophyly of both groups. In the phylogeny\nsubsociality optimizes to the base of Anelosimus, indicating that the\ncommon ancestor of the ethicus group was subsocial. Its members can thus\nbe predicted to be subsocial, or secondarily solitary. Regardless,\nstudying their biology is important to advance understanding on the\nevolution of sociality in spiders. Quasisociality arose de novo in the\nrupununi group, representing one of six to seven independent origins in\ntheridiid spiders.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anelosimus phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_243.phy"}]}
