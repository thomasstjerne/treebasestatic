The occurrence of E.\nhypophylla on Paeonia apparently looked curious, because host plants of\nthis species have been restricted to a few Quercus species of the family\nFagaceae. In this study, we determined the rDNA sequences of the powdery\nmildew specimens on Paeonia and E. hypophylla on Quercus to confirm the\nidentity of the Paeonia fungus. The three sequences from the specimens\non P. lutea were identical to each other in both ITS and 28S rDNA\nregions and also to the sequences of E. hypophylla on Q. robur, which\nsupports the identification that the fungus on P. lutea is E.\nhypophylla. However, these sequences were also identical to the\nsequences of E. alphitoides on Quercus spp. and Oidium mangiferae on\nmango. This suggests a possibility that E. hypophylla is conspecific to\nE. alphitoides. Further study is required to clarify whether E.\nhypophylla is a synonym of E. alphitoides or a distinct species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paeonia Powdery Mildew ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paeonia Powdery Mildew 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2569.phy"}]}
