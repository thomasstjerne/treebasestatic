Panicum scabridum and species of\nColeataenia are cespitose and perennial plants, with a lower glume\n(1â“)3â“5-nerved, 1/3 to 3/4 of the spikelet, upper glume and lower\nlemma 5â“9-nerved, and upper anthecium smooth, shiny, and indurate.\nWithin Coleataenia, P. scabridum appeared as the sister taxon of the\nspecies pair C. prionitis and C. petersonii; these three species are the\nonly NADP-me taxa of tribe Paspaleae exhibiting two bundle sheaths\naround the vascular bundles, i.e., with an outer parenchymatous sheath\nand a inner mestome sheath with specialized chloroplasts. The new\ncombination Coleataenia scabrida is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NdhF Panicoid - scabridum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69766.phy"}]}
