(dandelion tribe) in Forl√¨-Cesena Province, Italy, and is\nintroduced in this paper using morphological and molecular data.\nCombined phylogenetic analysis of ITS, GAPDH, CHS, ACT and TUB2 sequence\ndata demonstrate that C. sonchicola is a distinct species within the\ndematium species complex. The new species is illustrated and compared\nwith related taxa. This provides the first record of a Colletotrichum\nspecies from the genus Sonchus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107236.phy"}]}
