The main characteristic of this fungus is the presence of\na clearly higher number of ascospores per ascus (up to six), compared to\nthe other species of the genus: M. cannonballus, M. eutypoides and M.\nmonosporus. M. ibericus is also characterized by the production of a\ncleistothecial ascomata with a tomentose peridium and, similarly to the\nother species of the genus, by the absence of anamorph. In addition to\nthe morphological data, the comparative analysis of the ITS-region\nsequences of M. ibericus and other Monosporascus spp., has supported the\ncreation of the new species. A phylogenetic study based on the sequences\nof the 18S rDNA, did not allow to assess clearly the taxonomic position\nof the genus Monosporascus, although the results would indicate this\ngenus might be closer to the Xylariales than to the Sordariales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monosporascus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3925.phy"}]}
