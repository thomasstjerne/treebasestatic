The new species is distinguishable from other\nOrientophila species by the substrate preference to tree barks and the\nhabitat specificity to inland areas. Molecular analyses applying ITS and\nmtSSU sequences clearly classify O. corticola as a distinct species in\nthe genus Orientophila. A surrogate key is provided to assist in the\nidentification of all 13 taxa in the genus Orientophila.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123078","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123080","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123080.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123081","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123081.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123079","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123079.phy"}]}
