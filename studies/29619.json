The characteristics of Hermanssonia xxx\ninclude annual, resupinate basidioma, a monomitic hyphal system, and\noblong ellipsoid basidiospores that are 56 × 2.43 μm. The basidioma of\nH. xxx changes drastically on drying, from being a light-coloured, very\njuicy fruitbody with a very papillose and wrinkled surface, to\ndark-coloured, more or less smooth. The characteristics of Phlebia yyy\ninclude annual, resupinate basidioma with clay-buff dry aculei, 23\naculei per mm, a monomitic hyphal system, tubular cystidia measuring\n2025 × 33.5 µm, and oblong ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.45.2 ×\n2.13 μm. The phylogenetic analyses based on the combined 2-locus dataset\n[ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) + nuclear large subunit RNA (nLSU)] confirm the\nplacement of two new species respectively in Hermanssonia and Phlebia.\nPhylogenetically closely related species to the two new species are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136225.phy"}]}
