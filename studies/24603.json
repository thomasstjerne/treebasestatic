Phylogenetic analyses revealed\nthat P. ciliatus collections from Japan, China and Denmark had the\nidentical nrLSU sequences and formed a distinct clade allying to P.\nlongiporus. Examinations of cultural characters revealed that P.\nciliatus produce subglobose to fusiform, rarely clavate chlamydospores.\nWe also re-evaluated the holotype of P. saitoi collected from Japan.\nPolyporus saitoi has been treated as a synonym with P. ciliatus, but the\nholotype has corky context, reddish brown pileus surface in drying\ncondition and larger pores [(3) 45 pores/mm] than in P. ciliatus, and is\nmorphologically distinct from P. ciliatus. We conclude that P. saitoi is\na dubious name because its holotype lacks microscopic characters besides\nskeletal-binding hyphae is insufficient for species identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118646","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118646.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118645","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118645.phy"}]}
