From a collection of soil and phyllospheric\nbacteria, nine strains susceptible to growth-inhibition by B. cinerea\nwere identified. B. cinerea mutants unable to produce botrydial caused\nno bacterial inhibition, thus demonstrating the inhibitory role of\nbotrydial. A taxonomic analysis showed that these bacteria corresponded\nto different Bacillus species (six strains), Pseudomonas yamanorum (two\nstrains) and Erwinia aphidicola (one strain). Inoculation of WT and\nbotrydial non-producing mutants of B. cinerea along with B.\namyloliquefaciens strain MEP218 in soil demonstrated that both\nmicroorganisms exert reciprocal inhibitory effects; the inhibition\ncaused by B. cinerea being dependent on botrydial production. Moreover,\nbotrydial production was modulated by the presence of B.\namyloliquefaciens MEP218 in confrontation assays in vitro. Purified\nbotrydial in turn, inhibited growth of Bacillus strains in vitro and\ncyclic lipopeptide (surfactin) production by B. amyloliquefaciens\nMEP218. As a whole, results demonstrate that botrydial confers B.\ncinerea the ability to inhibit potential biocontrol bacteria of the\ngenus Bacillus. We propose that resistance to botrydial could be used as\nan additional criterion for the selection of biocontrol agents of plant\ndiseases caused by B. cinerea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D Suppl.","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacillus spp. recN","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118359.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2E Suppl.","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacillus spp. recA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118362.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2H Suppl.","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomonas spp. rpoD","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118358.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2F Suppl.","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erwinia spp. rpoB","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118360.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C suppl.","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomonas spp. 16S rRNA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118361.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A suppl.","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacillus spp. 16S","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118356.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2G Suppl.","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomonas spp. gyrB","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118363.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B Suppl.","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erwinia spp. 16S","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118357.phy"}]}
