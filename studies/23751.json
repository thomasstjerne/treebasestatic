This is\none of the few genera of the Sarcoscyphaceae not associated with plant\nmaterial – wood or leaves. The sclerotium is composed of hyphae of both\nArmillaria species and Wynnea species. To verify the existence of\nArmillaria species in the sclerotia of those Wynnea species not\npreviously examined and to fully understand the structure and nature of\nthe sclerotium, molecular data and morphological characters were\nanalyzed. Using nuclear ITS rDNA sequences of the Armillaria species\nwere identified from all examined material. The Armillaria species fall\ninto two clades  the A. gallica-calvescens-sinapina clade and the A.\nmellea clade. Divergent time estimates of the Armillaria and Wynnea\nlineages support a cophylogenetic relationship between these two\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armallaria ITS 20181103 NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117295.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wynnea comb SSU ITS LSU NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117293.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria symbiont ITS NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117294.phy"}]}
