T. harzianum has not been linked unequivocally to its\nsexual state nor has its phylogeny been studied in detail. It has been\nsuggested that T. harzianum is a species complex based on the phenotypic\nand genotypic variability encountered. On the basis of morphological and\ncultural characters and DNA sequence data analysis of four genes (ITS\nrDNA, translation elongation factor 1-É\u001a, calmodulin and É\u001a-actin),\nHypocrea lixii was found to be the sexual state of T. harzianum. Both\nthe asexual and sexual states of this species have wide geographic\ndistributions. Phylogenetic analysis of four genes showed that T.\nharzianum/H. lixii is a cohesive group that is supported by bootstrap\nvalues higher than 95%. Principles of genealogical concordance indicated\nthat T. harzianum/H. lixii is a complex of independent monophyletic\nlineages, but no diagnostic biological distinctions were identified that\njustify formal taxonomic recognition for the different lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 2a","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4011.phy"},{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 2b","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4012.phy"},{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4013.phy"},{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4014.phy"},{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 5","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4015.phy"},{"tree_label":"Similar to Fig. 6","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma harzianum/Hypocrea lixii complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4016.phy"}]}
