Three of the groups, Argenteae, Dimorphae, and Geyeriae, have\nretained relatively large numbers of plesiomorphic characters. The\nmembers of these three groups are mostly nonstoloniferous and have not\nevolved characters often associated with sexual dimorphism that occur in\nthe remainder of Antennaria. Consequently these three groups closely\nresemble the suprageneric outgroup, Anaphalis and Gnaphalium. The\nPulcherrimae and Catipes represent the most specialized groups. These\ntwo groups have wider distributions and occur in a much greater\ndiversity of habitats than the Argenteae, Dimorphae, and Geyeriae.\nEvolutionary advancement in the genus has been toward dioecism and\ncoincident sexual dimorphism, probably as a method to promote\noutcrossing. In addition, polyploidy and two asexual means of\nreproduction, agamospermy and horizontal stolons, have evolved in the\nmore specialized groups, the Pulcherrimae and Catipes. Antennaria\nprobably arose from Mexican Gnaphalium sometime during the Oligocene or\nMiocene, migrated into the western United States where it has evolved\nand migrated into other areas of the northern hemisphere and South\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antennaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1563.phy"}]}
