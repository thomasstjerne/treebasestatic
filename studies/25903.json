Through morphological observation and multilocus\nphylogeny of ITS, LSU, act, rpb2, tef1-Î± and tub2 gene regions,\nindicating 21 distinct lineages with high branch support. These include\n10 Cytospora species were new, i.e., C. cinnamon, C. cotoneastricola, C.\nochreae, C. olivaceae, C. pruni-mume, C. roseae, C. rosicola, C.\nroyalae, C. sorbina, C. tibetensis, and 11 known taxa include Cytospora\nerumpens, C. japonica, C. leucosperma, C. leucostoma, C. mali, C.\nparasitica, C. populinopsis, C. schulzeri, C. sibiraeae, C. spiraeae and\nC. tamaricicola. This study provides an initial understanding of the\ntaxonomy of Cytospora associated with canker and dieback disease of\nRosaceae in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"249","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123393.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"219","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123394.phy"}]}
