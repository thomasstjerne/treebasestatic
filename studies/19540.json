In the tongue, TASRs sense the sweet\nand umami and the toxin-related bitter taste thus promoting a particular\neating behaviour. Moreover, their relevance in other organs is now\nbecoming evident. In the intestine, they regulate nutrient absorption\nand gut motility. Upon ligand binding, TASRs activate the\nappetite-reward circuitry to signal the nervous system and keep body\nhomeostasis. With the aim to identify genetic variation in the swine\nTASRs and in the genes from the appetite and the reward pathways, we\nhave sequenced the exons of 201 TASRs and appetite-reward genes from 304\npigs belonging to ten breeds and to two phenotypically extreme groups\nfrom a F2 resource with data on growth and fat deposition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Swine Taste receptors TASRs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97141.phy"}]}
