In this study we show that\nthe length and roundness of urediniospores and the PCR-amplified\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of rusts occurring on Alnus\nand Betula are different. Morphologically the rust on alder is like M.\nhiratsukanum, and based on our results is not conspecific with M.\nbetulinum. The sequence comparisons indicated that 5.8 S rDNA was\nsimilar in both Melampsoridium species and identical to several\nCronartium sequences. The 5.8S rDNA of Melampsoridium was also more\nsimilar to Pucciniastrum, Chrysomyxa and Puccinia than to Melampsora\nspecies. The ITS sequences were distinct from all other rusts, but\nrelatively similar to Cronartium, Pucciniastrum and Chrysomyxa\nsequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsoridium rusts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3461.phy"}]}
