Lophophorates\nthemselves, however, form a polyphyletic assemblage. The hypotheses that\nthey are monophyletic and more closely allied to Deuterostomia than to\nProtostomia can be ruled out with both the approximately unbiased test\nand the expected likelihood weights test. The existence of Phoronozoa, a\nputative clade including Brachiopoda and Phoronida, has also been\nrejected. According to our analyses, phoronids instead share a more\nrecent common ancestor with bryozoans than with brachiopods.\nPlatyhelminthes is the sister group of Lophotrochozoa. Together these\ntwo constitute Spiralia. Although Chaetognatha appears as the sister\ngroup of Priapulida within Ecdysozoa in our analyses, alternative\nhypothesis concerning chaetognath relationships could not be\nrejected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophophorate and Chaetognath Relationships, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4898.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophophorate and Chaetognath Relationships, BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4899.phy"}]}
