Different morphological species have been recorded along the\nAtlantic coast of Morocco; however, no clear diagnostic characters were\navailable to discriminate between cylindrical species. In this study,\nmolecular markers were used to characterize species. The sequence of the\nRubisco spacer allowed identification of six species of Gracilariaceae:\nG. gracilis, G. dura, G. conferta, G. vermiculophylla and G.\nmultipartita and Gracilariopsis longissima. In order to identify species\nwith certainty, two simple and rapid methods based on the amplification\nof rDNA ITS and PCR-RFPL of the large subunit of the Rubisco were\ndeveloped.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gracilaria, ML Bootstrap","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1062.phy"}]}
