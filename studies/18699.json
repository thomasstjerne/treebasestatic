It is characterized by light to dark brown stromata with yellow\ncrystals on surface, monomorphic part-ascospores, dense conidiogenous\npustules and yellowish pigment at 35 °C on PDA. The species belongs to\nthe Longibrachiatum lineage and is closely related to T. kunigamense.\nDifferences between the new species and their close relatives are\ndiscussed, and their phylogenetic positions based on the RPB2 and TEF1-α\nsequences are explored.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93671","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93671.phy"}]}
