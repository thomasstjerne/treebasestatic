Here, we\npresent a robust molecular phylogeny based on the nuclear RAG1 gene as\nwell as results from a variety of alternative independent molecular\nclock calibrations. Our analyses suggest that the origin and early\ndivergence of the three living amphibian orders dates back to the\nPalaeozoic or early Mesozoic, before the breakup of Pangaea, and soon\nafter the divergence from lobe-finned fishes. The resulting new\nbiogeographic scenario, age estimate, and the inferred rapid divergence\nof the three lissamphibian orders may account for the lack of fossils\nthat represent plausible ancestors or immediate sister taxa of all three\norders and the heretofore paradoxical distribution of some amphibian\nfossil taxa. Furthermore, the ancient and rapid radiation of the three\nlissamphibian orders likely explains why branch lengths connecting their\nearly nodes are particularly short, thus rendering phylogenetic\ninference of implicated relationships especially difficult.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amphibia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6699.phy"}]}
