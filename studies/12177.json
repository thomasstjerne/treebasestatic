It has been found in three localities in the Andean\nPatagonian temperate forests, growing strictly on dung of an endemic\nmarsupial Dromiciops gliroides. The new species is distinguished by the\nhemispheric and black capitulum of ascoma, the presence of asci with\ncroziers, 1-celled brown ascospores, and its fimicolous habitat.\nAnalysis of partial nuclear large subunit rDNA (LSU) sequences showed\nthat this taxon is within Mycocaliciales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU BI","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50046","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50046.phy"}]}
