Ingroup is represented by sixty-two taxa\ncomprising 18 genera and 44 species, including members of the\nClathraceae, Claustulaceae, Gastrosporiaceae, Lysuraceae, Phallaceae,\nand Protophallaceae. Sixty-one new sequences were generated for this\nstudy, including tropical and subtropical taxa. This is one of the first\nstudies discussing the phylogenetic placement of Abrachium, AseroÃ«,\nBlumenavia, Gastrosporium, Jansia, and Xylophallus. Gastrosporiaceae was\ndemonstrated to be sister to Phallaceae and an emended description of\nthe order is presented. AseroÃ« was demonstrated to be polyphyletic, and\nas a result, A. arachnoidea is transferred to Lysurus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67884.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67885","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67885.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67886","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67886.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67887","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67887.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67888","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67888.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67889.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67890.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67891.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67892.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67893.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67894.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67895.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67896.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67897.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67898","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67898.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67899","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67899.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67900.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67901.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67902","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67902.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67903.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67904.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67905","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67905.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67906.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67907.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67908.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67909.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5475","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67913.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67910.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67911.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67912","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67912.phy"}]}
