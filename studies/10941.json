Samples from\nCameroon (West Africa), the Mediterranean and Nile River differed by at\nmost ,a single nucleotide per gene, indicating the potential for a\nrecent connection between these currently disjunct populations via the\nNile-Congo River systems. Recently reported mitochondrial diversity\nbetween Mediterranean and “sub-Saharan” samples of the Nile softshell\nindicate significant divergence across the species range, but cannot be\nfully incorporated into our analysis since these samples lack specific\nlocality data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25367","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25367.phy"}]}
