This paper describes formally Globisporangium\nconiferarum sp. nov. as a new species and compares it with other closely\nrelated known Globisporangium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135475","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135475.phy"}]}
