We introduce the new taxon Phylloporia\nlonicerae, which is the first Phylloporia species to originate from\nJapan. This species grows exclusively on living Lonicera japonica and is\ndistinguished by annual, sessile basidiocarps that occur in clusters,\npileal surface of narrow, concentrically sulcate zones, 68 pores per mm,\nduplex context separated by a black zone, dimitic hyphal system, and\nbroadly ellipsoid basidiospores, 3.24 × 2.33.1 µm. Phylogenetically, P.\nlonicerae is nested within the Phylloporia clade as a distinct terminal\nlineage with full statistical supports and sister to the clade of P.\nminutispora, P. cf. pulla and P. terrestris with weak supports. Besides\nPhylloporia bibulosa, P. chrysites and P. spathulata, P. lonicerae is\nthe fourth species of Phylloporia recorded from Japan. An identification\nkey to all accepted 48 species of Phylloporia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109975","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109975.phy"}]}
