Two separate lineages of Costaceae are\nnative to the Neotropics; an early-diverging clade endemic to South\nAmerica (consisting of ca. 16 species in the genera Monocostus,\nDimerocostus and Chamaecostus); and the Neotropical Costus clade (ca. 50\nspecies), a diverse assemblage of understory herbs comprising nearly\nhalf of total familial species richness. We use a robust dated molecular\nphylogeny containing most of currently known species to inform\nmacroevolutionary reconstructions, enabling us to examine the context of\nspeciation in Neotropical lineages. Analyses of speciation rate revealed\na significant variation among clades, with a rate shift at the most\nrecent common ancestor of the Neotropical Costus clade. There is an\noverall predominance of allopatric speciation in the South American\nclade, as most species display little range overlap. In contrast,\nsympatry is much higher within the Neotropical Costus clade, independent\nof node age. Our results show that speciation dynamics during the\nhistory of Costaceae is strongly heterogeneous, and we suggest that the\nCostus radiation in the Neotropics arose at varied geographic\ncontexts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical spiral gingers","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97148.phy"}]}
