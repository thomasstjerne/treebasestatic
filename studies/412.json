DNA sequences for vicilin,\na gene encoding a putative seed storage protein, were analyzed using\nparsimony. Both Herrania and Theobroma appear monophyletic on the\nmost-parsimonious trees, but the monophyly of Theobroma is only weakly\nsupported. The monophyly of all currently recognized sections of both\ngenera was supported with the exception of Theobroma section\nGlossopetalum within which was nested the monotypic section\nAndropetalum. The analysis sheds light on the morphological\ndiversification of these closely related genera and serves to\ndemonstrate the potential phylogenetic utility of vicilin.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theobroma and Herrania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3357.phy"}]}
