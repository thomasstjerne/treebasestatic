Puccinia\npodophylli, the etiological agent of this rust, has been shown to be\ndistantly related to both Puccinia and Uromyces as exemplified by their\ntypes. A systematic study was made to address the generic classification\nof P. podophyllii. Phylogenetic analyses of two rDNA loci from multiple\nNorth American specimens support the non-congenerity of this taxon with\nother genera of Pucciniaceae. Based on historical literature and type\nmaterial, this species was found to represent the type of the forgotten\ngenus Allodus and it is correctly named Allodus podophylli. A neotype is\ndesignated for Puccinia podophylli Schwein. (â‰¡ Allodus podophylli) and a\nlectotype is designated for Aecidium podophylli.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mayapple Rust LSU SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48980.phy"}]}
