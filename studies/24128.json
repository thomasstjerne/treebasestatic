These strains also\nformed well-supported clades in phylogenies reconstructed from the 16S\nrRNA, gyrB sequences and a concatenation of 139 sequences from\nsingle-copy ortholog genes. Similarly, Methylorubrum populi BJ001T and\nMethylorubrum thiocyanatum JCM 10893T were closely related in the\nreconstructed phylogenies and exhibit a high degree of genetic\nrelatedness (dDDH: 83.1%, ANI: 98.19  97.80%). Considering all\nabove-mentioned results, Mtr. populi should be considered a later\nheterotypic synonym of Mtr. thiocyanatum, and Mtb. phyllosphaerae should\nbe considered a later heterotypic synonym of Mtb. oryzae. This study\nhighlights the need for taxonomic revisions based on whole-genome\nsequence analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Methylo concatenated gblocks","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117155.phy"}]}
