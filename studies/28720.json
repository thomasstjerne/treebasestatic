Recent\nphylogenetic analyses based on plastome data resolved the relationships\namong the three tribes and the intergeneric relationships within two of\nthose tribes. However, generic-level relationships within the largest\ntribe, Theeae, were not fully resolved. The role of putative WGD events\nin the family and possible hybridization events among genera within\nTheeae also remains to be tested further.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133126.phy"}]}
