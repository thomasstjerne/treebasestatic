In this study, a total of 181 macrofungal samples were\ncollected from forests in Mazandaran province, Iran. Pure mycelial\ncultures were successfully obtained from 91 collected samples. Regarding\nmorphological data, 47 isolates were selected for molecular\nidentification based on internal transcribed spacer region (ITS)\nsequence analysis. The results showed that the 38 macrofungal isolates\nwere belonging to 22 species, 19 genera, 10 families and 5 orders. Most\nof the macrofungi (47%) were identified as Trametes and Ganoderma\nspecies. Three isolates identified as Hohenbuehelia sp., Polyporellus\nbrumalis and Ceriporia lacerata were new records for Iran fungal flora.\nThis study increases the knowledge on Iranian macrofungal diversity and\nfacilitates future genetic and biotechnological investigations on these\nmacrofungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"result","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trametes and Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116435.phy"}]}
