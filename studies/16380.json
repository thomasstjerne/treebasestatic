Hence, signalers face two pressures: enticing partners to\nmate and avoiding detection by enemies. Undefended organisms with\nlimited escape abilities are expected to minimize predator recognition\nover mate attraction by limiting or modifying their signaling.\nAlternatively, organisms with anti-predator mechanisms such as\naposematism (i.e., unprofitability signaled by warning cues) might\nelaborate mating signals as a consequence of reduced predation. We\nhypothesize that calls diversified in association with aposematism. To\ntest this, we assembled a large acoustic signal database for a diurnal\nlineage of aposematic and cryptic/non-defended taxa, the poison frogs.\nFirst, we showed that aposematic and non-aposematic species share\nsimilar extinction rates, and aposematic lineages diversify more and\nrarely revert to the non-aposematic phenotype. We then characterized\nmating calls based on morphological (spectral), behavioral/physiological\n(temporal), and environmental traits. Of these, only spectral and\ntemporal features were associated with aposematism. We propose that with\nthe evolution of anti-predator defenses, reduced predation facilitated\nthe diversification of vocal signals, which then became elaborated or\nshowy via sexual selection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Dendro call tree","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77662.phy"}]}
