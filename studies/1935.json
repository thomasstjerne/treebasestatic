Here we\npresent the first phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships within the\nexclusively Neotropical genus Danaea based on a sampling of 60 specimens\nrepresenting 31 species from various Neotropical sites. We used DNA\nsequence data from three plastid regions (atpB, rbcL, and trnL-F), field\nobservations, and morphological and geographical information to examine\nevolutionary patterns. Eleven representatives of five other marattioid\ngenera (Angiopteris, Archangiopteris, Christensenia, Macroglossum, and\nMarattia) were used to root the topology. We identify three\nwell-supported clades within Danaea that are consistent with\nmorphological characters. Although the plastid markers used here do not\nprovide resolution within some species complexes, our phylogenetic\nhypothesis does provide a robust framework within which broad questions\nrelated to the morphology, taxonomy, biogeography, evolution, and\necology of these ferns can be addressed.
