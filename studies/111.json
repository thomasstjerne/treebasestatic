Outgroups included Morinaceae, Triplostegiaceae, and a\nsubset of Valerianaceae. The consensus tree resulting from three equally\nparsimonious cladograms shows that Dipsacaceae are divided into two\nmajor clades, one with Dipsacus and Cephalaria, the other including the\nremaining genera. Within the latter clade, Knautia is the sister group\nof the rest of the taxa. This study is a reappraisal of Dipsacaceae\nphylogeny, and the results broadly match previous evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1309.phy"}]}
