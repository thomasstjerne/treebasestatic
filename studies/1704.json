Mediterranea (Geraniaceae) consists of\nten species. The highest diversity of the group is located in the\nCaucasus and neighbouring areas of Turkey and Iran, with five endemic\nspecies. Other species reach western Europe and northwestern Africa. In\ncontrast to the current literature, we consider G. montanum and G.\nibericum subsp. jubatum to be synonyms of G. ibericum. An univariate\nmorphometric study revealed some valuable quantitative characters useful\nfor the identification of these species. Micromorphological features of\npollen, stigmas, seeds, and mericarps are investigated by SEM. A new key\nis provided, as well as new and detailed descriptions. Geranium kurdicum\nis here illustrated for the first time. Eleven lectotypes are\ndesignated, and distribution maps are presented. Maximum parsimony and\nBayesian analyses of chloroplastic trnL-trnF and ribosomal nuclear ITS\nregions show that sect. Mediterranea is monophyletic. Two clades are\nrecovered, one including the annual species and other with the\nperennials, in which G. tuberosum (subsect. Tuberosa) emerges within a\nparaphyletic subsect. Mediterranea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"trnL-F","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geranium subsect.
