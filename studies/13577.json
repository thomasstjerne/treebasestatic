Based on 2 sampling campaigns on the\nGreek island of Lesvos in 2009 and 1 in northern Greece in 2012, this\nstudy provides first records of 3 intracellular eukaryotic pathogens\ninfecting filamentous brown algae at these locations: Eurychasma\ndicksonii, Anisolpidium sphacellarum, and A. ectocarpii. Field and\nmicroscopic observations of the 3 pathogens are complemented by the\nfirst E. dicksonii large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) gene sequence\nanalyses of isolates from Lesvos and other parts of the world. The\nlatter highlights the monophyly of E. dicksonii worldwide and confirms\nthe basal position of this pathogen within the oomycete lineage\n(Peronosporomycotina). The results of this study strongly support the\nnotion that the geographic distribution of the relatively few eukaryotic\nseaweed pathogens is probably much larger than previously thought and\nthat many of the world’s marine bioregions remain seriously undersampled\nand understudied in this respect.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oomycetes Brown Macroalgae LSU SSU cox2 joined\nalignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60619.phy"}]}
