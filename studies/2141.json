Preussia mediterranea\nresembles P. australis, P. africana and P. similis from a morphological\npoint of view, but appeared closer to P minima and P. isabellae by\nmolecular analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the entire ITS region\ncombined with the D1-D2 domains of the 28S rRNA gene, and a fragment of\nthe elongation factor EF-1\u001a√ë gene, using Maximum Likelihood and a\nBayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, generally resulted in\nstatistically well-supported clades for all the species studied.\nMorphological data and molecular phylogenetic analysis supported the\nrecognition of the new taxon","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Preussia, ITS-28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Preussia, EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1s","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Preussia, ITS-28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2s","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Preussia, EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5287.phy"}]}
