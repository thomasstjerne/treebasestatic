Nine strains were isolated from Schima\nsuperba, Ficus microcarpa and Ilex chinensis in Hainan Province, China\nand their ITS-tub2-tef1 sequence based phylogeny and morphology were\nanalyzed. They represented four species, viz, Monochaetia schimae sp.\nnov., Neopestalotiopsis haikouensis sp. nov., Neopestalotiopsis piceana\nand Pestalotiopsis licualacola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135804.phy"}]}
