It is not known to\nproduce either meiotic or mitotic spores and is only known to exist in\nthe form of hyphae, sclerotia, and host colonized ectomycorrhizal root\ntips. Due to its lack of sexual and asexual spores and reproductive\nstructures, it has proven difficult to incorporate into traditional\nclassification within Ascomycota. Molecular phylogenetic studies of\nribosomal RNA placed Cenococcum in Dothideomycetes, but the definitive\nidentification of closely related taxa remained elusive. Here we report\na phylogenetic analysis of five nuclear loci (SSU, LSU, TEF1, RPB1,\nRPB2) of Dothideomycetes that placed Cenococcum as a close relative of\nthe genus Glonium of Gloniaceae (Pleosporomycetidae, incertae sedis)\nwith strong statistical support. Glonium is a genus of saprobic\nDothideomycetes that produces darkly pigmented, carbonaceous, hysteriate\napothecia and is not known to be biotrophic. Evolution of\nectomycorhizae, Cenococcum and Dothideomycetes is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cenococcum and Pleosporomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49008.phy"}]}
