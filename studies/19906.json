Erysiphe\neucalypticola is genetically distinct from all other species of Erysiphe\ns. lat. based on ITS and 28S rRNA gene sequences, and morphologically\ndiffers from other powdery mildews on Eucalyptus in having conidia\nproduced in singly, multilobed conidial germ tubes (Pseudoidium type),\nshorter conidiophores, and smaller foot cells. Phyllactinia\nlagerstroemiae is the first species from the basal Phyllactinieae group\nfound outside of North and South America, and differs from other basal\nPhyllactinieae group members such as Ph. leveilluloides, Ph. angulata,\nand Ph. chubutiana in having longer conidiophore foot cells and\nconidiophores in general, but shorter conidiophore foot cells and\nconidiophores in total than in Ph. obclavata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_12","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllactinia lagerstroemiae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107189.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_12","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllactinia lagerstroemiae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_101","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe eucalypticola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107188.phy"}]}
