While our analyses of\nDNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 gene\nsupports the monophyly of the genus, these traditional subgroups were\nnot recovered. Five well-supported clades within the genus were\nidentified through these analyses: 1) the spectabilis-imperialis group;\n2) the nevadense-penetrans group; 3) a clade formed by G. underwoodii,\nG. validipes and G. cf.Â flavidellus; 4) the aeruginosus-luteofolius\ngroup and 5) the lepidotus-subearlei group. Relationships among these\nsubgroups were not resolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict 51","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6257.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6618.phy"}]}
