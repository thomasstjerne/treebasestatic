The species differs\nfrom others in this genus by ellipsoidal sporangiospores with\nunilaterally thickened walls. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear\nlarge subunit ribosomal DNA (nLSU rDNA) partial sequences suggest that\nU. gibberispora, U. swartii and U. westeae form a clade together with\nthe strains of Umbelopsis ramanniana. The ex-type strain of Micromucor\nramannianus var. angulisporus is found to be very close to Umbelopsis\nvinacea, whilst other isolates identified under the former name in the\nsense of Linnemann fall in the U. ramanniana subclade. For these\nisolates, a new species, Umbelopsis angularis, is introduced.\nPhylogenetic relationships among Umbelopsis species are discussed\nrelated to their attributes of the sporangial wall and mature spore\nshapes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4072.phy"}]}
