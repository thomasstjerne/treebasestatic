The focus of\nthis study is the green ashes (subgenus Eucalyptus section Eucalyptus).\nWhile previous studies, based primarily on morphology, suggest that the\ngreen ashes form a monophyletic group, there has been disagreement\nconcerning the divergence of taxa. This study aims to estimate the\nphylogeny of the green ashes and closely related eucalypts (37 taxa from\nover 50 locations in south-eastern Australia) using genome-wide analyses\nbased on Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT). Results of analyses were\nsimilar in topology and consistent with previous phylogenies based on\nsequence data. Many of the relationships supported those proposed by\nearlier workers. However other relationships, particularly of taxa\nwithin the Sydney region and Blue Mountains were not consistent with\nprevious classifications. These findings raise important questions\nconcerning how we define species and discern relationships in Eucalyptus\nand may have implications for other plant species, particularly those\nwith a complex evolutionary history where hybridisation and\nrecombination have occurred.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis of green ashes and other taxa in\nsubg.
