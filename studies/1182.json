Umbilicaria antarctica propagates by means of\nthalloconidia. U. kappenii lacks these, but exhibits a variety of\nasexual propagules: soredia, adventive lobes and thallyles. We have now\nemployed molecular data from three gene regions to examine the\nphylogenetic relationships of these two morphotypes. The phylogeny of\nten samples and four outgroup taxa (Umbilicaria decussata, U.\nkrascheninnikovii, U. nylanderiana, U. umbilicarioides) was\nreconstructed using Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses of a\ncombined data set of nuclear ITS, nuclear LSU rDNA and mitochondrial LSU\nrDNA sequences. 42 new partial sequences of 14 specimens were generated.\nOur results indicate that all samples morphologically referred to U.\nantarctica and U. kappenii form a monophyletic group. A topology\nseparating the two morphotypes as phylogenetic species is significantly\nrejected with the data set. It is proposed to place U. kappenii into\nsynonymy with U. antarctica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbilicaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1825.phy"}]}
