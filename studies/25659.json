The new species is distinguishable\nfrom other Orientophila species by the substrate preference to tree\nbarks. Molecular analyses employing ITS and mtSSU sequences clearly\nclassify O. corticola as a distinct species into the genus Orientophila.\nA surrogate key is provided to assist in the identification of all 13\ntaxa in the genus Orientophila.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121523.phy"}]}
