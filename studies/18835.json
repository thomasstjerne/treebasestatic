However,numerous diseases are known to affect this family of\nplants. One such disease is the Citrus Black Spot (CBS) caused by the\nfungus Phyllosticta citricarpa. To identify alternatives for the\nbiological control of citrus diseases, endophytic fungi were isolated\nfrom healthy plants of the orchards with incidence of Citrus Black Spot,\nin Brazil. A collection of over 400 fungal isolates was obtained and\namong these isolates, the strain LGMF1254 was selected, because it\ninhibited P. citricarpa. This strain was identified as Muscodor sp. by\nmorphologic and phylogenetic analysis, performed through ITS sequencing\nof rDNA. LGMF1254 showed high similarity with M. sutura, M. vitigenus,\nand M. equiseti; however, 10 polymorphic sites were observed on RPB2\nsequences of M. sutura and LGMF1254 (the RPB2 sequences from M.\nvitigenus and M. equiseti are not available). By analyses of RPB2\nsequence and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production, LGMF1254 can\nbe probably classified as a new species; however, sequences of genes\nother than ITS region are necessary to understand this genus better.\nLGMF1254 showed high activity against P. citricarpa, such as the\ninhibition of growth and pycnidia formation, due to the production of\nvolatile secondary metabolites. These volatiles, among which the main\nproducts are thujopsene, cedrene, azulene, cis-α-bergamotene, and\nα-himachalene, could be used during the transport of fruits,preventing\nthe development of the CBS symptoms. Here, for the first time in Brazil,\nwe describe the isolation of Muscodor, as well the production of\ncompounds with activity against the phytopathogen P. citricarpa from\nit.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93624","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93624.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93623","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93623.phy"}]}
