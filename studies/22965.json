The\nmorphology of specimens collected from China and Australia are studied.\nThree species, D. austrosinensis, D. boidinii and D. eburneum, collected\nfrom southern China, are described and illustrated as new to science\nbased on the morphological and molecular evidence. Dichostereum\naustrosinensis is characterized by the relatively large gloeocystidia\n(80130 × 815 µm) and basidiospores (7.38 µm in diam.) with large warts\nand crests. Dichostereum boidinii is distinguished by its thick\nbasidiomata and relatively small basidiospores (5.56.5 µm in diam.) with\nlarge warts and crests. Dichostereum eburneum is unique for the pale\nbasidiomata growing on bark of living Castanopsis, presence of numerous\ncrystals in context and basidiospores with dense and large\nornamentations. A key to the 5 species of Dichostereum in China is\ngiven.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112470.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112471.phy"}]}
