We therefore\npropose a set of universally applicable primers that allow reliable\namplification of actin genes. For primer construction the amino acid\nsequences of 57 actin genes comprising fungi, animals, plants and\nprotists were analysed, aligned and used for the definition of six\nwell-conserved regions which are suitable as priming sites in PCR\namplification experiments. Ten primers were designed for specific in\nvitro amplification of actin gene fragments from a wide range of\nmicroorganisms. The corresponding gene fragments provide a strong basis\nto isolate nearly complete actin genes for further molecular\ncharacterization and for establishing phylogenies based on actin gene\ntrees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eukarya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3663.phy"}]}
