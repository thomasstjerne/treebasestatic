Previous data have mostly shown an allopolyploid origin of\nHordelymus, but very recently it was suggested that Hordelymus is\nautoploid. The present analysis, including representatives from all\nbasic genome types accepted in the Triticeae, lends support to an\nalloploid origin. There is substantial support for the progenitor of\nPsathyrostachys as female genome donor of Hordelymus. Individual nuclear\ngene trees disagree about the male genome donor, but combined analysis\nof all data weakly supports the common progenitor to Pseudorogneria and\nHenrardia as the male genome donor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triticeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5068.phy"}]}
