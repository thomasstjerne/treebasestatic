Their hard skeletons form the substratum of reef\necosystems and confer on corals their remarkable diversity of shapes.\nCorallimorpharians are non-calcifying, close relatives of scleractinian\ncorals, and the evolutionary relationship between these two groups is\nkey to understanding the evolution of calcification in the coral\nlineage. One pivotal question is whether scleractinians are a\nmonophyletic group, paraphyly being an alternative possibility if\ncorallimorpharians are corals that have lost their ability to calcify,\nas is implied by the “naked-coral” hypothesis. Despite major efforts,\nrelationships between scleractinians and corallimorpharians remain\nequivocal and controversial. Although the complete mitochondrial genomes\nof a range of scleractinians and corallimorpharians have been obtained,\nheterogeneity in composition and evolutionary rates means that\nmitochondrial sequences are insufficient to understand the relationship\nbetween these two groups. To overcome these limitations, transcriptome\ndata were generated for three representative corallimorpharians. These\nwere used in combination with sequences available for a representative\nrange of scleractinians to identify 291 orthologous single copy\nprotein-coding nuclear markers. Unlike the mitochondrial sequences,\nthese nuclear markers do not display any distinct compositional bias in\ntheir nucleotide or amino-acid sequences. A range of phylogenomic\napproaches congruently reveal a topology consistent with scleractinian\nmonophyly and corallimorpharians as the sister clade of\nscleractinians.","trees":[{"tree_label":"aa partitioned raxml","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95811.phy"},{"tree_label":"aa complete phylobayes catgtr","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95809.phy"},{"tree_label":"aa complete phylobayes jtt","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95810.phy"},{"tree_label":"aa partitioned mrbayes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corallimorpharians","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95808.phy"},{"tree_label":"aa complete raxml","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95812.phy"},{"tree_label":"nt partitioned codon mrbayes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corallimorpharians","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95813.phy"},{"tree_label":"nt partitioned gene mrbayes","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95814.phy"},{"tree_label":"nt partitioned codon raxml","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95816.phy"},{"tree_label":"nt complete raxml","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95815.phy"},{"tree_label":"nt partitioned gene raxml","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corallimorpharians","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95817.phy"}]}
