The species\nwas isolated from cool regions in Japan and morphologically and\nphylogenetically close to a heterothallic species M. parvispora, which\nis the first species reported as a heterothallic species in the genus.\nMycelial growth of the species was limited at 30 Â°C, whereas two\nisolates of M. parvispora can grow. This may indicate that the species\nand M. parvispora adapted to different climates from a common ancestor\ninvolving differentiation of the manner of reproduction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Msugadairana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113127.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Msugadairana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113128.phy"}]}
