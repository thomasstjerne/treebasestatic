New sequence data are presented for four species: N.\nelongata, N. multispora and N. ramosa and the new species N. crenulata.\nOur combined maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses from SSU, 5.8S\n(ITS) and LSU regions of rDNA showed that Nowakowskiella is not a\nmonophyletic clade due the position of Nowakowskiella elongata, which is\nmore related to Cladochytrium. We reclassify N. elongata as the type of\nthe new genus Karlingiella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladochytriales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116437.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladochytriales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116438.phy"}]}
