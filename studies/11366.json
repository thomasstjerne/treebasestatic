Both powdery mildews have a thin, single layer of\nperidium cells of chasmothecia, which is a morphological character of\nthe genus Brasiliomyces. However, recent molecular phylogenetic analyses\nindicating the polyphyletic of Brasiliomyces and showing that the two\ncollected powdery mildews belong to the Erysiphe lineage with Oidium\nsubgenus Pseudoidium anamorphs. Therefore, we describe them as two new\nspecies of Erysiphe in this report.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68982","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68982.phy"}]}
