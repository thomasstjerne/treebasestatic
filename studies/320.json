It is compared\nwith original herbarium specimens and recent isolates of T. atroviride\nP. Karsten, one of which is designated as epitype. RFLP analyses of the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA gene cluster, and\nsequence analysis of the ITS1 region were used to group these and other\nisolates received as T. harzianum. Two major groups were found. The\nfirst group, the T. harzianum complex, comprises the neotype and other\nisolates from the type locality, Okuda group 2 isolates, Muthumeenakshi\ngroup Th1 mushroom isolates, some isolates used in biological control,\nthe ex-type culture of T. inhamatum, and the aggressive mushroom\ncompetitor the Muthumeenakshi group Th2. The latter forms a distinct\nsubgroup of group 1 on the basis of unique RFLP and ITS1 sequence types\n(six base pairs different); it will be taxonomically distinguished from\nT. harzianum in a forthcoming paper. The name T. harzianum requires\nconservation because of the existence of two obscure older names for the\nsame taxon, the ex-type cultures of which fall also in the first group.\nThe second group, the T. viride-T. atroviride complex, comprises Okuda\ngroup 1 and Muthumeenakshi group Th3 isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1476.phy"}]}
