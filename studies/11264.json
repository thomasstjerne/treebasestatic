Although morphologically similar, each population\nis distinguished by a different set of unrelated mitochondrial\nhaplotypes, suggesting that they have evolved from different ancestors.\nDue to a possible discordance between mitochondrial and species\nphylogeny, we performed phylogenetic analysis based on 22 nuclear loci.\nThe results inferred from Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian Inference\nanalysis revealed that northern and southern populations are closely\nrelated, forming a monophyletic group. This observation is concordant\nwith the present marble trout classification, which considers both\npopulations as conspecific. On the other hand, our findings are in\nmarked contrast to those of previous mtDNA-based studies and highlight\npotential dangers of making phylogenetic inferences from mtDNA alone.\nReasons for discordance between mtDNA and nDNA phylogeny are discussed\nwith incomplete lineage sorting proposed as the most parsimonious\nexplanation for mtDNA divergence in marble trout.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marble trout","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_29863.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marble trout","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_29861.phy"}]}
