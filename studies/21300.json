Herein we describe a new species and genus, Exabiete\nhillariae (Phleogenaceae, Atractiellales), to accommodate this unusual\nspecies based on morphological characterization and a multilocus\nphylogenetic analysis. In culture, E. hillariae produces minute white\nsporodochia, similar to those produced by several other members of\nAtractiellales, but lacking any teleomorphic characteristics.\nAdditionally, we provide a taxonomic revision of Atractiellomycetes\nbased on multi-locus analyses and propose a new genus, Neogloea, to\naccommodate ex-Helicogloea species that are congeneric with H.\nvariabilis. Accumulated evidence suggests Atractiellomycetes species are\ncommon but infrequently isolated members of the plant root and foliar\nendobiomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105749.phy"}]}
