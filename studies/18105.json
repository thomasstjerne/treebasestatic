Furthermore, we conducted morphological comparisons of the\nJapanese isolates. The phylogenetic analyses of ITS2 and LSU rRNA gene\nshowed that the Japanese isolates were included in the G. piceiperda\ncomplex. Phylogenetic analyses of the partial Î²-tubulin and EF-1Î±\ngenes separated the species complex into 9 and 13 lineages,\nrespectively. Morphologically distinct species were included in the same\nclade as the Î²-tubulin analysis. However, based on EF-1Î± analysis,\nthese fungi could be separated into different lineages. Furthermore,\nmorphological observations supported this result and confirmed that the\nJapanese lineages are morphologically distinguishable. Among these 13\nrecognized lineages, the Japanese isolates were separated into 11\nlineages, including G. aenigmatica, G. laricis, G. piceiperda D, and 8\nnew lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig S1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89907.phy"}]}
