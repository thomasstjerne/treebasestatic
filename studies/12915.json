A cladistic analysis is carried out in\norder to test previous phylogenetic hypotheses and the monophyly of this\nfamily. The material examined consists on several Mesozoic taxa\ntraditionally assigned to the Chanidae and several living\nGonorynchiformes, including Chanos chanos. The results provide new\nsynapomorphies of the order Gonorynchiformes, and reject some previously\nproposed synapomorphies. The monophyly of the Chanidae is confirmed on\nthe basis of fourteen synapomorphies, nine of which are uniquely derived\ncharacters. These synapomorphies provide the basis for the new diagnosis\nof this family. Chanos is not the sole member of the family Chanidae.\nThe analysis confirms that the fossil taxa considered in the study\n(Aethalionopsis, Dastilbe, Gordichthys, Parachanos, Rubiesichthys, and\nTharrhias) must also be included within the chanids. This implies\nindependent evolution of the caudal endoskeleton in Chanos and in the\nother Recent gonorynchiforms. The Spanish Early Cretaceous forms\nRubiesichthys gregalis and Gordichthys conquensis are sister-taxa,\nforming the subfamily Rubiesichthyinae n. subfam. This clade is the\nsister-group to all other chanids, which form the subfamily Chaninae\nn. subfam. Rubiesichthys and Gordichthys are the oldest fossil record of\nthe family Chanidae and of the order Gonorynchiformes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 22","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chanidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53868.phy"}]}
