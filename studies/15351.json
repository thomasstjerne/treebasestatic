The\nisolates could not be assigned to an existing taxon and were\ncharacterized in a morphological study and a phylogenetic analysis. They\nwere found to differ from related Phytophthora species by their\ncharacteristic obturbinate, often distorted sporangia with external\nproliferation, moderately large oogonia with aplerotic oospores,\npredominantly amphigynous but occasionally paragynous and intercalary\nantheridia, the presence of catenulate hyphal swellings, their high\noptimum temperatures for growth, and their relatively slow radial growth\nrates. An unusual characteristic was the germination of zoospores within\nthe sporangia. In the phylogenetic analyses involving sequences from\nseven nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, the isolates formed a\ndistinct monophyletic group within Phytophthora clade 7 with strong\nbootstrap support. On the basis of their unique combination of\ncharacters the isolates are considered to be a new species and are\nformally described as Phytophthora pseudoasparagi sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pseudoasparagi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70430.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pseudoasparagi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70447.phy"}]}
