In this study, based on large scale field sampling,\nand combined with multi-locus molecular and morphological analyses, H.\ndematioides and two new varieties isolated from Tomicus galleries were\nidentified for the first time in China. Molecular studies proved that\nbeta-tubulin and actin genes could be used as phylogenetic markers for\nH. dematioides at the intraspecific level. Inoculation experiments\ndemonstrated that H. dematioides and the new varieties could infect\nYunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis Franch), but no significant differences\nwere detected among them in mean lesion length on phloem of Yunnan pine\ntrees. These results have enriched the general knowledge of the varietal\ndifferentiation and geographical distribution of H. dematioides in\nChina, as well as their relationship with Tomicus bark beetles in\nallowing them to cause severe damage to pines in Southwestern\nChina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian Tree from ITS Analyusis","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102077.phy"}]}
