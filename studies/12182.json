Several species, including giant taro, A. macrorrhizos, and\nChinese taro, A. cucullata, are important food plants or ornamentals. We\ninvestigated the biogeography of this genus using plastid and nuclear\nDNA sequences (5200 nucleotides) from 78 accessions representing 71\nspecies, plus 25 species representing 16 genera of the Pistia clade to\nwhich Alocasia belongs. Divergence times were inferred under strict and\nrelaxed clock models, and ancestral areas with Bayesian and maximum\nlikelihood approaches. Alocasia is monophyletic and sister to Colocasia\ngigantea from the SE Asian mainland, whereas the type species of\nColocasia groups with Steudnera and Remusatia, requiring taxonomic\nrealignments. Nuclear and plastid trees show topological conflict, with\nthe nuclear trees reflecting morphological similarities, the plastid\ntrees species geographic proximity, suggesting chloroplast capture. The\nancestor of Alocasia diverged from its mainland sister group c. 24\nmillion years ago, and Borneo then played a central role in the\nexpansion of Alocasia: 1113 of 1819 inferred dispersal events originated\non Borneo. The Philippines were reached from Borneo 45 times in the Late\nMiocene and Early Pliocene, and the Asian mainland 67 times in the\nPliocene. Domesticated giant taro originated on the Philippines, Chinese\ntaro on the Asian mainland.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alocasia chronogram nuclear","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alocasia ML chloroplast","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alocasia ML nc","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50061.phy"}]}
