To show the strengths and limitations of 18S rRNA\nsequences for phylogenetic analysis, we analyze and discuss trees from\n49 diverse species of fungi and 3 animal outgroups. We consider the\nimplications of the tree and nucleotide substitution rates for the\ntiming of fungal divergences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"near fig.Â 4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3630.phy"}]}
