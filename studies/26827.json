Two Erysiphe (sect.\nUncinula) species have been known on Fraxinus spp. so far. In this\nstudy, Fraxinus powdery mildews from wide areas of the world were\ncollected to make molecular and morphological analyses. These specimens\nare divided into three distinct molecular phylogeny groups which are\ndistinguishable by their morphology and/or host plants. The fungus\noccurring on F. apertisquamifera and F. lanuginosa is described as a new\nspecies Erysiphe neofraxini. Epitypes are designated for E. fraxinicola\nand E. salmonii. In traditional species delimitation, many hosts were\nshared by E. fraxinicola and E. salmonii, but the current analyses\nstrongly suggest strict host specificity among these three powdery\nmildew species. Evolutionary timing calculated by molecular clock\nanalysis suggests co-evolution of powdery mildews with their Fraxinus\nhosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125440.phy"}]}
