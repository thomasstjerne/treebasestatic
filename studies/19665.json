Multilocus\nphylogenetic study revealed that all were hitherto unknown, and they are\ndescribed here as novel species, Cantharellus betularum, Voitk, Thorn,\nLebeuf & Kim, sp. nov., C. enelensis Voitk, Thorn, Lebeuf & Kim,\nsp. nov., and C. formosorella Voitk, Thorn, Lebeuf & Kim, sp. nov.\nThe commonest species, C. enelensis, is a member of the C. cibarius\nspecies group, prefers tall moss on sandy soil under Picea glauca, and\nis differentiated from European C. cibarius by its pinkish-orange,\nrather than yellow, hymenium and from C. roseocanus of the Pacific\nNorthwest by the lack of the pink or rainbow hues of the cap surface\nthat gave the latter its name. Cantharellus betularum is a sister\nspecies to European C. amethysteus, grows with birch, and only\noccasionally shows evidence of amethyst skin or scales on its cap.\nCantharellus formosorella is a sister species to C. formosus of the\nPacific Northwest, seems to prefer open areas with low moss near Abies\nbalsamea, has smaller fruiting bodies than its western sibling and at\ntimes has similar brown scales on its cap. All three species of\nmushrooms are edible.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132810.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132811.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132814.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132813.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132812.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF1 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132815.phy"}]}
