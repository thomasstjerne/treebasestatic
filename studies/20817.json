The history of the name Oidium caricae and its\nmisapplication to more than one species of powdery mildews is discussed\nunder Erysiphe diffusa, to which O. caricae is assigned as a heterotypic\nsynonym. Sphaerotheca caricae-papayae is synonymized with Podosphaera\nxanthii. Podosphaera caricicola comb. nov. and additional powdery mildew\nspecies occurring on papaya are also described. A key to the papaya\npowdery mildew species that are considered is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe necator","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103162.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podosphaera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103163.phy"}]}
