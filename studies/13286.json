Our results indicate that\nseveral avian reproductive traits, such as adults sitting on eggs,\nasymetrical eggs, unornamented eggshell surface, and complex eggshell\nultrastructure, were already prsent in non-avian maniraptorans, and\ncould have evolved in more basal theropods. In addition, non-avian\nmaniraptorans laid two eggs at a time and oriented their eggs\nsubvertically or subhorizontally in their nests, features not retained\nby neornithine birds. Based on our cladistic analysis it is also\npossible to infer the phylogenetic affinity of ootaxa of unknown\nparentage: Protoceratopsidovum was laid by a maniraptoran more derived\nthan oviraptorids, and Parvoolithus probably belonged to a Cretaceous\nbird. Finally, our analysis reveals that many of the hgih-level\ncategories of egg parataxonomy (morphotypes and basic types) are\nunnatural groupings (i.e. non-monophyletic). We recommend that these\nhigh-level categories be abandoned because oofamilies are sufficient to\ncategorize egg taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56308.phy"}]}
