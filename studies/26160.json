In addition to\nthe commonly accepted widespread T. nitens and North American T.\nfalcifolium, a strong genetic isolation is shown for two taxa.\nTomentypnum involutum is elevated from variety to species status, it is\nwidely distributed in permafrost areas in Siberia the islands of the\nArctic Ocean, high mountains in Scandinavia, and is known from the Rocky\nMountains of Canada and from Greenland. Tomentypnum vittii is described\nas a new species for eastern Asia and Siberia, in China and Russia\npreviously referred to T. falcifolium. Descriptions, illustrations, a\nkey for identification, and a map for the Eurasian distributions are\nprovided. Tomentypnum nitens is represented by four groups of\nhaplotypes, which lack morphological distinction, and are therefore\nreferred to one species. However, the distributions of the haplotype\ngroups are revealing; some are more confined to mires rich in relic\nspecies composition, whereas others are more widely distributed and\npartly seem to occur in recently recolonized sites. Different\ndistribution patterns in the densely sampled Sweden suggest different\nglacial and postglacial histories.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentypnum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125412.phy"}]}
