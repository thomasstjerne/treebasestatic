These relationships are explored in the context of results\nfrom phenetic and cladistic numerical analyses performed using\ncharacters taken from the Hagstrom monograph that are scored for 26\nsubsections. The Hagstrom classification represents an amalgam of\nphenetic and cladistic interpretations and the hierarchy does not depict\naccurately fundamental evolutionary relationships indicated by numerical\nanalyses. Recommendations are provided for developing and testing\nevolutionary hypotheses that are independent of relationships inferred\nby this long-standing but problematic classification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Potamogeton","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4346.phy"}]}
