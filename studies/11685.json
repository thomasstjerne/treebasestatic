Based on RAPD\ngenomic fingerprinting, ITS and Î²-tubulin DNA sequences, this species\nwas clearly distinct from C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae and C.\nsimmondsii as well as from the genetic groups A1, A6, A7 and A8, all\npreviously referred to as C. acutatum sensu lato. Group A4 is widespread\nin Europe, being responsible for olive anthracnose epidemics in some\nMediterranean countries, including Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Portugal\nand Spain; moreover, it causes anthracnose diseases on a wide range of\nother hosts including about 20 different genera of woody and herbaceous\nplants, ornamentals and fruit trees. This new anamorphic taxon is\ndescribed as Colletotrichum clavatum sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum, ITS UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47156.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum, TUB2 UPGMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47157.phy"}]}
