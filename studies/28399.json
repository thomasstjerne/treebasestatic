Cortinarius tibeticisalor were\ncollected from eastern Tibetan Plateau, associated with Abies, it\ndiffers from other species within sect. Delibuti in the olive tinge of\nmature or dried basidiomata and bigger basidiospores. The molecular data\nalso support C. subsalor and C. tibeticisalor as new species. The\nphylogenetic analyses and biogeography of sect. Delibuti are discussed\nand a key to the species of this section currently known in the world is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133002.phy"}]}
