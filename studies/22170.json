Fatty acids are important to people\nwith cold resistance. CPT1A encodes a protein that imports long-chain\nfatty acids into the mitochondria for fatty-acid oxidation. FADS is an\nessential enzyme for the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty\nacids. Results: In the present study, we investigated the distributions\nof three cold resistance-related SNPs (rs80356779 G>A in CPT1A,\nrs7115739 T>G in FADS3 and rs174570 C>T in FADS2) from six\npopulations that included 1,093 individuals who have lived in\nHeilongjiang Province for at least three generations. The frequencies of\nrs174570 and rs7115739 were different in our six north minorities\ncompared to the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna (CDX) in southern China.\nAll the SNPs in Hezhen were significantly different from other five\nstudied populations. In addition, the genetic distribution of rs174570\nin Daur was significantly different from Manchu and Korea, and the\nfrequency of rs7115739 in Ewenki was significantly different from the\nother populations. The results also showed that the frequencies of the\nthree SNPs in the six minorities were different from those of\nGreenlandic Inuit and Siberian population. Conclusions: Our results\nshowed the distributions of the three cold resistance-related SNPs from\nsix populations that included 1,093 individuals in northern China.\nDistributions of the allele frequencies for the cold resistance-related\nSNPs in northern China were statistically different from those in\nsouthern China. These data help to establish the DNA genome database for\nthe six populations and fully preserve existing minority genetic\ninformation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
