The species was\nfound in Yunnan Province, and grows on the undersides of a rotten\nbamboo. X. roseobubalina is characterized by annual, resupinate\nbasidioma with a pinkish buff hymenophore, a monomitic hyphal system,\ngenerative hyphae thin-walled with clamp connections, the presence of\nvoluminous crystalline among hyphae, theabsence of cystidia and\ncystidioles, and broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measuring\n3.85 × 3.34 μm. The phylogenetic analysis based on the nuc rDNA\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) dataset shows that the new species belongs to\nXenasmatella. The difference between X. roseobubalina and other members\nof the genus are discussed. In addition, two new combinations, X.\ngossypina and X. wuliangshanensis, are also proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135751.phy"}]}
