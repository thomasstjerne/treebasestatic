Its teeth lack labyrinthine\ninfolding, and the frontal did not reach the orbit. A new phylogenetic\nanalysis of stegocephalians suggests that Solenodonsaurus is an\nanthracosaur, and that it is the sister group of Cotylosauria. It also\nshows that the problematic taxon Westlothiana may not be an anthracosaur\n(not a stem-amniote). A recent suggestion that diadectomorph cotylosaurs\nlaid amniotic eggs is shown to be based on tenuous evidence, although\nthis remains a possibility. The evolution of the otic region is studied\nusing parsimony to determine whether the emargination present in\nSolenodonsaurus and in some diadectomorphs is a primitive or a secondary\ncharacter, but this procedure yields equivocal results.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best (Tem+Liss)","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shortest in which lissamphibians are temnospondyls","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2005.phy"},{"tree_label":"Shortest","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"One of 2 lobally shortest trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2004.phy"}]}
