The anthracnose is one of the most important\ndiseases of the orchid, mainly in tropical regions. Many species of the\ngenus Colletotrichum are responsible for causing this disease in orchids\nworldwide, however, little is known about the etiology of the disease in\nBrazil. The objective of this study was to identify species of the genus\nColletotrichum that infect orchids in the northeastern Brazil, using\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyzes associated with morpho-cultural\ncharacteristics. Nineteen isolates, obtained from orchid plants with\nsymptoms of anthracnose, gathered with six species of Colletotrichum: C.\ngloeosporioides s.s., C. karstii, C. orchidearum, C. orchidophilum, C.\nsiamense and C. tropicale. This is the first report of C. orchidophilum\nin orchids in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122662.phy"}]}
