Horizontal transmission\nbetween unrelated species also occurs; pathways and mechanisms are still\nunder debate, but parasitoid wasps have been suggested as potential\nvectors. Here we perform the largest screening of Wolbachia in any group\nof parasitoids by sampling 228 species of the family Ichneumonidae from\nAustralia. The observed infection frequency of 23% is very close to the\nproposed global equilibrium frequency of ~20%. Rates of gain and loss\nwere very similar in comparisons between different parasitoid\nlifestyles, such as endo- versus ectoparasitoids. Genotyping Wolbachia,\nwe found identical strains in several unrelated ichneumonid species and\nother insect groups from all over the world. A permutation test for the\nsharing of Wolbachia strains among parasitoids and known host orders did\nnot yield any conclusive results, nor did a test for a latitudinal\ngradient across Australia. We argue that future studies should carefully\nconsider the time scale of the process under investigation: the speed at\nwhich Wolbachia move horizontally is probably so high that potential\npatterns are quickly erased and cannot be detected when sampling at the\nspecies level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"WolbachiaRaxML","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106765.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106762","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106762.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106758","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106758.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106761","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106761.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106748","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106748.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106752","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106752.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106749.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106757","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106757.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106739","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106739.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106742","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106742.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106756","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106756.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106738","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106738.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106746","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106746.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106732","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106732.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106736.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106745","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106745.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106751.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106741.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106743","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106743.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106750.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106753.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106760","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106760.phy"},{"tree_label":"WolbachiaBayesian","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106764.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106755.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106734.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106733","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106733.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106747","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106747.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106737","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106737.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106759.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"232","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106754.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTIT
