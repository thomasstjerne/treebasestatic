Three phylogenetic lineages were recovered\nwithin rye leaf rust complex, Puccinia recondita s. str., which is\ncongruent with existing classification based on DNA content,\ninterfertility experiment, and morphological studies. Wheat leaf rust\n(P. triticina) grouped with P. persistens as a strongly supported clade.\nBrown leaf rusts on other Elymus spp. were separated into six clades.\nBased on the location of type specimens and aecial hosts, potential\ntaxonomic names were discussed for each lineage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
