Reconstructing the phylogeny of the Bursera simaruba species\ncomplex of neotropical trees based on five markers, we test the notion\nthat “satellite” species originated from populations of the most widely\ndistributed member of the group, B. simaruba, which the satellites\nstrongly resemble. Two of the satellites were recovered nested in a\ndistant clade from B. simaruba, suggesting that their similarity is due\nto convergence or parallelism. We tested species delimitation of B.\nsimaruba and the satellites using our molecular phylogenetic\nreconstruction, in addition to multivariate morphometric and ecological\nanalyses, a combination that pinpointed characters such as leaf\npubescence that need examination to refine simaruba complex taxonomy.\nRemarkably, despite its vast geographical and morphological range, we\nrecovered B. simaruba as a single valid species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera Simaruba Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52228.phy"},{"tree_label":"PEPC","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera Simaruba Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52229.phy"},{"tree_label":"NIA","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera Simaruba Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52230.phy"},{"tree_label":"psbA","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera Simaruba Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52231.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bursera Simaruba Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52227.phy"}]}
