All of this material has been recovered from the Wessex\nFormation (Barremian) of the Isle of Wight, UK and the Grinstead Clay\nMember (middle-upper Valanginian) of West Sussex, UK. Here, we provide a\ndetailed description of four additional associated specimens from the\nIsle of Wight that include almost complete hindlimbs, as well as\nassociated pelvic and axial elements. These new finds substantially\nincrease the amount of material available for the taxon and allow the\nfirst definitive associations between the dignostic femor and other\nelements of the skeleton. Comparisons with dryosaurid taxa and\ncontemporary Wealden ornithopods indicate that Valdosaurus can be\ndistinguished by a unique combination of femoral character states.\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of Dryosauridae and\nindicates that Valdosaurus forms a clade with Elrhazosaurus and\nDysalotosaurus to the exclusion of Dryosaurus. It is likely that\nValdosaurus was more abundant in Wealden faunas than has generally been\nassumed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 11","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55264","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55264.phy"}]}
