With approximately one-third of their genomes\nconsisting of linear and circular plasmids, the Lyme disease agent\ncluster of species has the most complex genomes among known bacteria. We\nreport here a comparative analysis of plasmids in eleven Borreliella\n(also known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"413","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyme disease agent bacteria PFam32 proteins PFam32","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110069.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"317","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyme disease agent bacteria Par-cluster","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110350.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lyme disease agent bacteria genome","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110157.phy"}]}
