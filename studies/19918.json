Pathogens most commonly associated with the disease\nare Alternaria spp. and Penicillium spp.. Although both genera show\nspecific morphological characteristics, they can be difficult to\nidentify to species level. Molecular methods using nuclear loci, such as\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal RNA genes, are\ncommonly used to identify fungal species. In this study, Alternaria spp.\n(49) and Penicillium spp. isolates (97), associated with pre- and\npost-harvest apple core rot symptoms and isolates from potential\ninoculum sources, were identified. Alternaria spp. were identified in\n19% pre-harvest and 35% post harvest of dry core rot infected fruit and\n23% or 25% of mouldy core rot samples using morphology. Species identity\nof a selection of samples was confirmed using the endopolygalactuonase\ngene, the ITS region, and the anonymous genomic regions (OPA1-3, 2-1),\nwhich resulted in the identification of A. alternate, A. arborescens, A.\ndumosa and A. tenuissima. Penicillium species were identified through\nITS sequencing and partial beta-tubulin polymerase chain reaction Â–\nrandom fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) for the samples\ncollected from wet core rot (WCR) symptoms. Phylogenetic analyses\nseparated the Alternaria spp. into five clades, including three separate\nclades for A. alternata, A. tenuissima and A. arborescens, respectively.\nFurthermore, this is the first report of Embellisia eureka as core rot\npathogen. The Pencillium phylogenies identified P. ramulosum (50% pre-,\n29% postharvest) and P. expansum (15% pre-, 53% postharvest) as the most\ncommonly occurring species associated with WCR symptoms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98608.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
