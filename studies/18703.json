Taxonomic and\nphylogenetic studies on Melanopus group were carried out. On the basis\nof morphological characters and phylogenetic evidence of DNA sequences\nof multiple loci including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregions, the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small\nsubunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit\nmitochondrial rRNA gene sequences (mtSSU), the translation elongation\nfactor 1-α gene (EF1-α), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II\n(RPB1), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), and\nβ-tubulin gene sequences (β-tubulin). The phylogenetic result indicates\nthat Melanopus group is not a monophyletic assemblage with black stipes.\nFour new species in Melanopus group of Polyporus, P. baishanzuensis, P.\nsubtropicus, P. subtubaeformis and P. tibeticus, are newly described and\nillustrated. A key to species of Melanopus group is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111812.phy"}]}
