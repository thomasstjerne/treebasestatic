However, the genome sequence of this organism has\nnot been reported so far. Results: We report the complete genome\nsequence of C. werkmanii BF-6 together with the description of the\ngenome features and its annotation. The size of the complete chromosome\nis 4,929,789 bp with an average coverage of 137Ã—. The chromosome\nexhibits an average G+C content of 52.0%, and encodes 4570 protein\ncoding genes, 84 tRNA genes, 25 rRNA operons, 3 microsatellite sequences\nand 34 minisatellite sequences. A previously unknown circular plasmid\ndesignated as pCW001 was also found with a length of 212,549 bp and a\nG+C content of 48.2%. 73.5%, 75.6% and 92.6% of the protein coding genes\ncould be assigned to GO Ontology, KEGG Pathway, and COG (Clusters of\nOrthologous Groups) categories respectively. C. werkmanii BF-6 and C.\nwerkmanii NRBC 105721 exhibited the closest evolutionary relationships\nbased on 16S ribosomal RNA and core-pan genome assay. Furthermore, C.\nwerkmanii BF-6 exhibits typical bacterial biofilm formation and\ndevelopment. In the RT-PCR experiments, we found that a great number of\nbiofilm related genes, such as bsmA, bssR, bssS, hmsP, tabA, csgA, csgB,\ncsgC, csgD, csgE, and csgG, were involved in C. werkmanii BF-6 biofilm\nformation.\nConclusions: This is the first complete genome of C. werkmanii. Our work\nhighlights the potential genetic mechanisms involved in biofilm\nformation and paves a way for further application of C. werkmanii in\nbiofilms research.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrobacter 16S ribosomal RNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107381.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citrobacter Core Pan 1 All MFA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107382.phy"}]}
