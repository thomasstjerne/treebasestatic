The\ntransition from these early forebears to the modern onychophoran body\nplan is poorly constrained, in part due to the absence of fossils\npreserving details of the soft anatomy. Here we report muscle tissue in\na new early Cambrian (Stage 3) lobopodian, Tritonychus phanerosarkus\ngen. et sp. nov., preserved in the Orsten fashion by three-dimensional\nreplication in phosphate. This first report of Palaeozoic onychophoran\nmusculature establishes peripheral musculature as a characteristic of\nthe ancestral panarthropod, but documents an unexpected muscular\nconfiguration. Phylogenetic analysis reconstructs T. phanerosarkus as\none of a few members of the main onychophoran lineage  which was as rare\nand as cryptic in the Cambrian period as it is today.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panarthropods","tree_kind":"Species
