A powdery mildew with Pseudoidium-type\nasexual morph commonly occurs on this species, but because of lacking\nsexual stage taxonomic placement of this fungus has long been unclear. A\nnew species Erysiphe aucubae is proposed for this fungus with molecular\nphylogeny and morphological descriptions of asexual morph.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97605.phy"}]}
