Based on\nmorphology and DNA sequence data (ITS and TEF-1α), four species were\nidentified. Of these, Neofusicoccum parvum, N. mediterraneum and N.\naustrale are known, while N. algeriense is described here as new. These\nspecies are reported here for the first time in Algeria. In this study,\na relationship between vascular lesions and Neofusicoccum species\nisolated were highlighted. The Neofusicoccum spp. were most often\nisolated from wedge-shaped and yellow soft wood rot and at a much lower\nincidence from central brown necrosis and black streaking. N. parvum was\nthe most frequently isolated (n=48) followed by N. algeriense (n=4),\nwhile N. mediterraneum and N. australe were only found once.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
