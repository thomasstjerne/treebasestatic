Phylogenetic\nanalyses of these sequences, along with previously sequenced Dipsacales\nand placeholders for other Asteridae and Rosidae, lead to the following\nconclusions: (1) the genera of Caprifoliaceae (in any traditional sense)\ndo not form a monophyletic group; (2) Symphoricarpos and Lonicera\n(representing Caprifoliaceae sens. str.) are related and are united with\nValerianaceae and Dipsacaceae; and (3) Adoxa and Sambucus are directly\nlinked and are possibly related to Viburnum. Our analyses also cast\ndoubt on the monophyly of Dipsacales and Asteridae. These findings are\ngenerally congruent with other molecular results and with hypotheses\nbased on morphological data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_433.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_425.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6D","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_426.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_427.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6C","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_428.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_429.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_430.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_431.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_432.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_420.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_421.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_422.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_423.phy"}]}
