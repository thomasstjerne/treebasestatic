(CACTACEAE,\nCEREEAE) AND CLOSELY ALLIED GENERA","Journal":" Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society","Volume":" 183","Issue":" 2","Pages":" 199-210","Keywords":" Cactus  Molecular Phylogeny  Biogeography  Divergence\nestimates  PHYC  trnS-trnG","DOI":" 10.1093/botlinnean/bow010","Abstract":" The genus Cereus (Cactaceae; Cereeae) comprises\napproximately 30 predominantly South American species distributed among\nfour subgenera: Oblongicarpi, Ebneria, Mirabella and Cereus. To study\npatterns of diversification in time and space, the trnS-trnG plastid\nregion was sequenced from representatives of Cereus and the closely\nrelated genera Cipocereus and Praecereus. For a subset of our total\nsamples, we also obtained sequences of the low-copy nuclear gene\nphotoreceptor phytochrome C (PHYC). Phylogenetic analyses rendered the\ngenus Cereus as a paraphyletic taxon, indicating the genus Cipocereus as\na sister clade of the subgenus Mirabella. Moreover, with the exception\nof Mirabella, the other subgenera of Cereus are also non-monophyletic.\nThe diversification of our ingroup lineage began around the\nPlio-Pleistocene transition, and most species diversification events\noccurred during the middle to late Pleistocene. Biogeographic analysis\ndetermined the region of the Cerrado biome, in central Brazil, as the\nmost likely ancestral range of our ingroup. Furthermore, more recent\nvicariance and dispersion events were identified for internal branches.\nOverall, our results support the notion that both Neogene orogenic\nevents and Pleistocene climatic oscillations have contributed to shaping\nthe diversification of modern lineages of South American biota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95590","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95590.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97662.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95591.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95593.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95594.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97663.phy"}]}
