In artificial seawater, the four isolates formed\nfragments such as in the genus Haliphthoros, but the protoplasm\nconstriction was weaker, and fragments were longer, with smaller spaces\nbetween them, than those of Haliphthoros. The four strains form one or\nmore discharge tubes from each zoosporangium. The four strains were\nsimilar, but not identical, to the genus Haliphthoros based on\nmorphological characteristics. As a result, the four isolates were\nclassified in a new genus and species, Halioticida noduliformans gen. et\nsp. nov. Phylogenetic analysis of the D1/D2 region of the large subunit\nribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA) was performed, and the four isolates\nshowed 100%â€“99.8% concordance. In the phylogenetic tree, the four\nisolates were not classified in the subclass Peronosporomycetidae,\nSaprolegniomycetidae, or Rhipidiomycetidae. However, the four isolates\nformed a new clade with genera Haliphthoros and Halocrusticida in\nPeronosporomycetes. Within this new clade, the four isolates,\nHaliphthoros spp. and Halocrusticida spp., were grouped in their\nrespective independent subclades. These results showed that these were\nthe new genus and species from the morphological characteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronosporomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6374.phy"}]}
