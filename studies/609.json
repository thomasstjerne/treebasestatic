Hypocrea jecorina is considered to\nreproduce primarily sexually, as opposed to other Hypocrea and\nTrichoderma species where asexual reproduction predominates. Like the\noriginal isolate of T. reesei, Qm 6a, all three new isolates exhibited\ncellulolytic activities. In contrast to Qm 6a, however, they grew on\nsucrose as sole carbon source and on nitrate as sole nitrogen source,\nthus indicating that these substrate utilization criteria are not\ntaxonomically reliable in Hypocrea (Trichoderma). The nonutilization of\nsucrose and nitrate in QM 6a is due to a lack of the uptake system for\nsucrose and of nitrite reductase activity, respectively, in that\nculture. Comparison of QM 6a and the three new isolates revealed that\nall H. jecorina isolates produce intracellular but not extracellular\ninvertase. The potential for using these strains in the improvement of\nthe commercially exploited strain of T. reesei, QM 6a, is\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma and Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma and Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma and Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma and Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma and Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3586.phy"}]}
