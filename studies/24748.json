However, disease pressure from downy\nmildew is hindering re-population efforts. The organism associated with\nthe downy mildew was determined to be a Peronospora species with brown,\nellipsoid conidia measuring 21 by 16 Âµm on average, which was\nmorphologically different from validly described species of Peronospora\nthat infect Plantago species, but it was morphologically similar to the\ninvalidly published species Peronospora lanceolatae [Art. 40.1].\nComparison of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1),\nmitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II (cox2), nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), nuclear 28S rRNA D1-D2 (28S) loci revealed the\nunknown Peronospora to be molecularly divergent from Peronospora alta\nand Peronsopora plantaginis, but very similar to Peronospora from\nPlantago lanceolata, the type host of P. lanceolatae. Phylogenetic trees\ninferred with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference from a\nconcatenated alignment and individual gene trees confirmed the\ndivergence of the unknown Peronospora from P. alta and P. plantaginis\nand its similarity to P. lanceolatae. However, attempts to inoculate\nPlantago lanceolata with the strain from Plantago princeps var. princeps\nwere unsuccessful, which, in conjunction with divergence in ITS,\nsuggests that the unknown Peronospora is specific to Plantago princeps\nvar. princeps. Herein, the Peronospora strain on Plantago princeps var.\nprinceps is described as the new species Peronospora kuewa based on\nmorphology, molecular phylogenetics, and host specificity. In addition,\nPeronospora gaponenkoae is described here to honor Nina Ivanova\nGaponenko on the basis of of her description of P. lanceolatae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126932","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126932.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126933","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126933.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126925","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126925.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126936","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126936.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126931","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126931.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126929.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126930","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126930.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126934","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126934.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126935.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126920.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126921.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126922.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126923.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126924.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126926","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126926.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126927","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126927.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126928.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126937","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126937.phy"},{"tree_label":"=","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126938","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126938.phy"}]}
