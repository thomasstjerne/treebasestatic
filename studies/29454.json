In morphological\nanalysis, R. atrofuscus is characterized by its dark gray to black\npileus, white to pale yellowish white hymenophore, grayish brown to pale\nyellow context, turning orange-yellow to rusty yellow when injured,\nwhite to pale yellow to black stipe, prominently and coarsely reticulate\nover the upper 3/4 or overall. In phylogenetic analysis, the specimens\nfrom Huanggang Mountain, grouped together with R. fuscus. However, they\nhave some morphological differences, R. fuscus has grayish brown to\ngrayish black pileus, white context, grayish white to yellowish pores.\nDescriptions and hand drawings of the new species and comparisons with\nsimilar species are shown below.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135739","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135739.phy"}]}
