We report\nhere the morphological and phylogenetic analyses of two Ophiocordyceps\nspecies from Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, Lam Dong Province, southern\nVietnam. Our data showed that one of our studied Ophiocordyceps is a new\nintraspecies of O. sphecocephala and another is a new record of O.\nasiana from Vietnam.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134298","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134298.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134297","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134297.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134299.phy"}]}
