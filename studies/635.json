An hypothesis of\ncladistic structure within Araneomorphae in the form of a quantitatively\nanalysed cladogram is presented for the first time. The analysis\nsupports orb weaving spiders (Orbiculariae: Deinopoidea and Araneoidea)\nas a monophyletic group (apparently sister to Dictynoidea) and\nLinyphiidae as an araneoid family. Likely precursors of orbs are\ndiscussed, as are relevant fossil evidence and possible times of\norigin","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orbiculariae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1124.phy"}]}
