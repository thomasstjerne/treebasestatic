Interpretations of\nspecies delimitations among breadfruit and its closest relatives have\nvaried from the recognition of one to several species. To better\nunderstand the systematics and ultimately the origins of this crop, we\nconsidered evidence from molecular data. Amplified fragment length\npolymorphism data for 261 individuals of breadfruit, its closest\nrelatives, putative hybrids, and nine outgroup taxa were analyzed using\nneighbor joining and parsimony analyses. Three species, A. altilis\n(domesticated breadfruit), A. camansi, and A. mariannensis, are\nrecognized and the existence of hybrids (A. altilis x A. mariannensis)\nverified. A revised treatment based on the molecular results, as well as\nmorphological and biogeographical considerations, is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Breadfruit","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Breadfruit","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2098.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"270","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Breadfruit","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2099.phy"}]}
