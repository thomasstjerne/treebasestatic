Based on the phylogenetic\nposition of P. lagena (CBS 185.65, generic type), the genus was\ntransferred to Penicillium and its seven species classified in section\nTorulomyces together with P. cryptum and P. lassenii. The aim of this\nstudy was to review Penicillium species producing conidiophores with\nsolitary phialides classified in section Torulomyces and complete a\nmonograph of its species. We adopted a consilient species concept using\nmorphology and multigene phylogeny. Based on our results, we classify P.\nlaeve and P. ovatum in section Exilicaulis, accept 16 species in section\nTorulomyces, which include 12 new species described as P. aeris, P.\naustricola, P. cantabricum, P. catalonicum, P. oregonense, P.\nmarthae-christenseniae, P. riverlandense, P. tubakianum, P. variratense,\nP. williamettense, P. wisconsinense and P. wollemiicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_ITS_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77264","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77264.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_Combined_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77266","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77266.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces CaM MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77255.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77260.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77262.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_ITS_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77263","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77263.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_Combined_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77267.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_CaM","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces CaM MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77256.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces CaM MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77254.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces BenA MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77257.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces BenA MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77258.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces BenA BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces BenA MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77259.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Torulomyces RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77261.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_Combined_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77268.phy"},{"tree_label":"Torulomyces_ITS_BI","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77265","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77265.phy"}]}
