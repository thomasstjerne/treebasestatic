Hypoxylon\nolivaceopigmentum is characterized by its pulvinate to glomerate\nstromata, olivaceous KOH-extractable pigments, equilateral ascospores\nand indehiscent perispore. Hypoxylon texensis can be distinguished from\nmorphologically similar species by its rust to dark brick\nKOH-extractable pigments and its chemical profile. Updated descriptions\nand comprehensive illustration with detailed information on the\ndiagnostic features of H. croceum, H. fendleri and H. perforatum are\nprovided. Sequence searches using the ITS sequence of H. croceum\nrevealed that the species is a widespread endophyte and endolichenic\nfungus with a broad host range in the southeastern USA. In addition,\nNodulisporium hinnuleum was determined to be a synonym of H. croceum.\nThe multi-locus phylogenetic reconstruction of Hypoxylon supported the\nstatus of the new species and broadened the knowledge about intergeneric\nrelationships and the identities of environmental isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115253.phy"}]}
