In\nthe present study numerouscladosporium-like taxa are treated, and\nallocated to different genera based on their morphology and DNA\nphylogeny derived from the LSU nrRNA gene. Several species areintroduced\nin new genera such as Hyalodendriella, Ochrocladosporium,\nRachicladosporium, Rhizocladosporium, Toxicocladosporium and\nVerrucocladosporium. A further newtaxon is described in Devriesia\n(Teratosphaeriaceae). Furthermore, Cladosporium castellanii, the\netiological agent of tinea nigra in humans, is confirmed as synonym of\nStenellaaraguata, while the type species of Stenella is shown to be\nlinked to the Teratosphaeriaceae (Capnodiales), and not the\nMycosphaerellaceae as formerly presumed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium, 1 of 44 MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4920.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium, 50% maj rule of 800 MBTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4921.phy"}]}
