We recognise seven European species within this\nsection, three of which are described as new: Hebeloma alboerumpens, H.\ngriseopruinatum and H. parvicystidiatum. The first two of these species\nappear to be ectomycorrhizal with Cistaceae: Cistus and Helianthemum.\nHebeloma parvicystidiatum is more likely to be in mycorrhizal\nassociation with Quercus spp. We also provide a key to the European\nspecies within sect. Theobromina and an updated key of known Hebeloma\nassociates of Cistus. Molecular analyses based on multiple loci further\nillustrate the distinctness of the newly described taxa and provide\nmolecular evidence, supporting the morphological evidence, for the\nrelationship that exists among species of this section. The ITS is the\nonly one from the sequenced loci that, alongside with morphology,\ndistinguishes among all of the species of sect. Theobromina. The section\ngains most of its molecular support from the MCM7 locus, followed by\nRPB2.","trees":[{"tree_label":"theo_lsu+++","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55033","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55033.phy"},{"tree_label":"1+++","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55035.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55038.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55037.phy"},{"tree_label":"1+++","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55034.phy"},{"tree_label":"1+","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55036.phy"},{"tree_label":"concat","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55040.phy"}]}
