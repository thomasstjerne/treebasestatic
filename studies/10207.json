We gathered sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial gene regions\n(28S, 18S, Histone 3, 16S-ND1, CO1) and used them to reconstruct\nsalticid phylogeny by parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our\nresults confirm that lapsiines and hisponines are among the basal\nsalticids, i.e.Â outside the major clade Salticoida. The lapsiines are\nresolved as sister group to the spartaeines. The precise placement of\nhisponines is unclear, but they may represent a deep-branching lineage\nindependent from the spartaeines.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"All genes Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6689.phy"}]}
