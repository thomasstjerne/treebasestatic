Here we use DNA\nsequence data from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes to derive a\nrobust phylogeny of all the extant species. Our data rejects the\nwidespread notion that pelicans can be divided into white- and\nbrown-plumaged groups. Instead, we find that, in contrast to all\nprevious evolutionary hypotheses, the species fall into three\nwell-supported clades: an Old World clade of the Dalmatian, Spot-billed,\nPink-backed and Australian Pelicans, a New World clade of the American\nWhite, Brown and Peruvian Pelicans, and monospecific clade consisting\nsolely of the Great White Pelican, weakly grouped with the Old World\nclade. We discuss possible evolutionary scenarios giving rise to this\ndiversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Extant Pelicans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58452.phy"}]}
