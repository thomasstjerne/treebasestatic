Species boundaries were defined using detailed\nmorphological illustrations, comprehensive descriptions and multi-gene\nphylogeny of maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian posterior probability\n(BYPP) analyses. Our findings expanded the knowledge on host and\ndistribution ranges of the newly isolated pleosporalean taxa in\nItaly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127168.phy"}]}
