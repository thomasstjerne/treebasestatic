From the\nresults can be concluded that seven species belong to the series\nCitrina. Penicillium sizovae and Penicillium steckii are closely related\nto P. citrinum, P. gorlenkoanum is revived, Penicillium hetheringtonii\nsp. nov. and Penicillium tropicoides sp. nov. are described as new\nspecies and the combination Penicillium tropicum is proposed.\nPenicillium hetheringtonii is closely related to P. citrinum and differs\nin having slightly broader stipes, metulae in verticils of 4 or more and\nthe production of an uncharacterized metabolite, tentatively named\nPR1-x. Penicillium tropicoides resembles P. tropicum comb. nov., but\ndiffers in the slow maturation of the cleistothecia, slower growth at 30\nÂ°C and the production of isochromantoxins. The type strain of P.\nhetheringtonii sp. nov. is CBS 122392T (=IBT 29057T) and the type strain\nof P. tropicoides sp. nov. is CBS 122410T (=IBT 29043T)","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8683","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8683.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 BenA","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8684.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2 BenA","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8685","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8685.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8686","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_8686.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8687","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8687.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8688","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8688.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8689","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8689.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8690","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8690.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6 cmd","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8691","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8691.phy"}]}
