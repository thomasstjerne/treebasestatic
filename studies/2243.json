Morphological cladistic studies have suggested\nthat several other genera of Lamioideae ˆ Acrotome, Isoleucas, Leonotis,\nOtostegia (pro parte) ˆ may be closely related to Leucas, or even nested\nwithin it. Here we use phylogenetic analysis of three plastid DNA loci,\nthe trnL-F region, trnS-G spacer, and the rps16 intron and reach similar\nconclusions. Many of the morphological features used to maintain Leucas\nsince 1810 are shared ancestral (symplesiomorphic) characters. The other\ngenera (or subgeneric group in the case of Otostegia) are therefore\ndefined by apomorphic states. This is particularly apparent in the case\nof Leonotis, with its highly specialized bird-pollinated flowers,\nderived within a paraphyletic and insect-pollinated Leucas. Some\ngeographically isolated groups are monophyletic, including all Asian\nspecies of Leucas, a Socotran clade, and a large African lineage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucas group, Lamiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5879.phy"}]}
