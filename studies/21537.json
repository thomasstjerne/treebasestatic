Understanding and stabilising the taxonomy of genera and species\nof Mycosphaerellaceae is therefore of the utmost importance given their\nimpact on agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Based on previous\nmolecular studies, several phylogenetic and morphologically distinct\ngenera within the Mycosphaerellaceae have been delimited. In this study\na multigene phylogenetic analysis (LSU, ITS and rpb2) was performed\nbased on 415 isolates representing 297 taxa and incorporating ex-type\nstrains where available. The main aim of this study was to resolve the\nphylogenetic relationships among the genera currently recognised within\nthe family, and to clarify the position of the cercosporoid fungi among\nthem. Based on these results many well-known genera are shown to be\nparaphyletic, with several synapomorphic characters that have evolved\nmore than once within the family. As a consequence, several old generic\nnames including Cercosporidium, Fulvia, Mycovellosiella, Phaeoramularia\nand Raghnildiana are resurrected, and 32 additional genera are described\nas new. Based on phylogenetic data 120 genera are now accepted within\nthe family, but many currently accepted cercosporoid genera still remain\nunresolved pending fresh collections and DNA data. The present study\nprovides a phylogenetic framework for future taxonomic work within the\nMycosphaerellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108348","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108348.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 published Bayesian tree","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108343","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108343.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 published Bayesian tree","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108346","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108346.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 published Bayesian tree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108352","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 unpublished strict consensus parsimony tree","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108344","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108344.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 unpublished strict consensus parsimony tree","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108347","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108347.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108345","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108345.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"262","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae published Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108340.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 unpublished strict consensus parsimony tree","ntax":"262","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108341","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108341.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"262","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108342","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108342.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae published Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108349.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 unpublished strict consensus parsimony tree","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108350","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 unpublished RAxML tree","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108351","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 unpublished strict consensus parsimony tree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108353","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108353.phy"}]}
