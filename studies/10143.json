They are severely overlooked and their identity and\nnutritional strategies are mostly unknown. Most of these bryosymbiotic\nfungi belong to the Ascomycota. Their fruit-bodies are extremely small,\noften reduced and simply structured, which is why they cannot be\nreliably identified and classified by their morphological and anatomical\ncharacters. A phylogenetic hypothesis of bryosymbiotic ascomycetes is\npresented. New sequences of 78 samples, including 61 bryosymbionts, were\nproduced, the total amount of terminals being 206. Of these, 202 are\nAscomycetes. Sequences from the following five gene loci were used: rDNA\nSSU, rDNA LSU, RPB2, mitochondrial rDNA SSU, and rDNA 5.8S. The program\nTNT was used for tree search and support value estimation. We show that\nbryosymbiotic fungi occur in numerous lineages, one of which represents\na newly discovered lineage among the Ascomycota and exhibits a\ntripartite association with cyanobacteria and sphagna. A new genus\nTrizodia is proposed for this basal clade. Our results demonstrate that\neven highly specialized life strategies can be adopted multiple times\nduring evolution, and that in many cases bryosymbionts appear to have\nevolved from saprobic ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epibryophytic Ascomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6287.phy"}]}
