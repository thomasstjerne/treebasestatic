An example is\nthe re-classification of Rhizophlyctis rosea¬-like organisms into 3 new\ngenera within the new order Rhizophlyctidales. One genus was\nBorealophlyctis, and it contained two species–only one of which was\ndescribed. A recent survey of chytrid diversity in the state of Alabama\n(United States of America) yielded an additional two cultures of the\nunnamed species. With light and transmission electron microscopy, we\nexamined the available representatives of this species (cultures\nDOAM229843, WJD170, and WJD171). We also analyzed partial nuc 28S rDNA\n(28S) and nuc rDNA region encompassing the internal transcribed spacers\n1 and 2 and 5.8S (ITS) sequences to determine the phylogenetic placement\nof the cultures within Rhizophlyctidales. Based on molecular divergence\nfrom Borealophlyctis paxensis and morphological differences observed\nduring development, we describe the species Borealophlyctis\nnickersonii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Borealophyctis nickersonii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87194.phy"}]}
