However,\nthe phylogenetic placement of two yeast-like genera Malassezia and\nMoniliella in the subphylum remains unclear. Phylogenetic analyses using\ndifferent algorithms based on the sequences of six genes, including the\nsmall subunit (18S) ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the large subunit (26S) rDNA\nD1/D2 domains, the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS 1 and 2)\nincluding 5.8S rDNA, the two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and\nRPB2) and the translation elongation factor 1-Î± (EF1-Î±), were\nperformed to address their phylogenetic positions. Our analyses\nindicated that Malassezia and Moniliella represented two deeply rooted\nlineages within Ustilaginomycotina and have a sister relationship to\nboth Ustilaginomycetes and Exobasidiomycetes. Those clades are described\nhere as new classes, namely Moniliellomycetes with order Moniliellales,\nfamily Moniliellaceae, and genus Moniliella; and Malasseziomycetes with\norder Malasseziales, family Malasseziaceae, and genus Malassezia.\nPhenotypic differences support this classification suggesting widely\ndifferent life styles among the mainly plant pathogenic\nUstilaginomycotina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monilliella and Malassezia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96577.phy"}]}
