The diversity\nand systematics of the genera within Discodorididae are poorly\nunderstood and have led to numerous taxonomic changes. Hoplodoris Bergh,\n1880 has recently been considered a synonym of Asteronotus Ehrenberg,\n1831; however, morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses reveal\na distinct separation between these two genera. Here we provide a\nre-description of the type species Hoplodoris desmoparypha as well as\ndescriptions of four undescribed species of Asteronotus and Hoplodoris.\nBayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of two mitochondrial\nand two nuclear genes were used to evaluate the phylogenetic positions\nof the new species and clarify the relationships between Asteronotus and\nHoplodoris to the rest of the Discodorididae. Based on our results,\nHoplodoris is removed from synonymy with Asteronotus. Descriptions for\nAsteronotus markaensis sp. nov., and Asteronotus namuro sp. nov. from\nthe Red Sea, as well as Hoplodoris balbon sp. nov. and Hoplodoris rosans\nsp. nov. from the western Pacific are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"16S Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124670.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S RAxML","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124671.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI RAxML","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124673.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3 Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"H3 MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124668.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3 RAxML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"H3 RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124669.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124674.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S RAxML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124675.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125224.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125223.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125225.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125226.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125228.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124672.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125227.phy"}]}
