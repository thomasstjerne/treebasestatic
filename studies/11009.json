Virtually every ensuing\nstudy has treated T. pseudonana as a marine diatom, with genomic and\nexperimental data thought to provide insights into the diatom ecology\nand evolution of diatoms in the world’s oceans. The natural distribution\nof T. pseudonana actually spans both marine and fresh waters, and\nphylogenetic analyses show that the ancestral habitat type this model\nmarine diatom is most likely freshwater, with marine strains\nrepresenting recent recolonizations of higher salinity habitats. The\nmultitude of physical barriers that must be overcome for diatoms to\nsuccessfully colonize freshwaters suggests that T. pseudonana’s\nphysiological traits, and the genes underlying those traits, might\ndiffer substantially from those of a strictly marine diatom, undermining\nits established role as a model marine diatom. Phylogenetic analyses\nalso ally T. pseudonana with the genus Cyclotella, compelling\nresurrection of T. pseudonana’s original name, Cyclotella nana.\nCyclotella contains a mix of marine and freshwater species and so more\naccurately conveys the complexities of the phylogenetic and natural\nhistories of T. pseudonana, which merit consideration in the\ninterpretation of experimental data collected for this important model\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25641.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25640.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25647.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25646.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25644.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25645.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25642.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclotella nana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25643.phy"}]}
