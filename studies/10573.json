It is characterized by a stipe with a minutely squamulose covering\nand a volvate base, by abundant and evident velar remnants on pileus\nsurface, and very thick-walled elements in the pileipellis. A discussion\non its taxonomic position within Macrolepiota and notes on closely\nrelated species are also provided. By a molecular point of view it is\nclose to M. fuliginosa ss Vellinga, a non-veiled taxon very different\nfrom M. fuliginosa in the original sense of Barla. As there are no\nusable herbarium specimens for the type of Lepiota procera var.\nfuliginosa a lectotype and an epitype are designated hereby to preserve\ncurrent usage of the name. As lectotype the Barlaâ€™ s Fig. 5/PL. 9 (from\nLes champignons des Alpes maritimes) was selected. The epitype chosen\nfor L. procera var. fuliginosa is a recent collection from Sardinia\n(Italy).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule w/PP","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig. 1 (Tr9468)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_9468.phy"}]}
