To date, thirteen EpichloÃ« species and\ntwenty Neotyphodium species have been formally described, based on\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analyses. Most of them are\nfrom the native grass. Leymus chinensis (Poaceae) is a dominant grass\nnative to the Inner Mongolia steppe of China. Previously, it was\nreported to harbor endophytes, but little was known about these\nendophytes. To investigate their diversities and taxonomy, 96 fungal\nisolates were obtained from three field populations of L. chinensis. The\nisolates were classified into three morphotypes based on morphological\ncharacters and phylogenetic analyses of Î²â“tubulin gene (tubB),\ntranslation elongation factor 1â“Î± gene (tefA) and actin genes (actG)\nsequences. The dominant morphotype, morphotype I, was identified as a\nchoke disease endophyte, EpichloÃ« bromicola. This broadened the host\nrange and phylogenetic definition of E. bromicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr54788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_54788.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr54789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_54789.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"actG of Epichloe from Leymus chinensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60767.phy"}]}
