The fungus is characterized by the production of only one type\nof conidia, globose or subglobose in front view, broadly ellipsoidal or\noblong in lateral view, with dark brown to black central cells and\nsubhyaline to pale brown peripheral cells and sporulation in culture.\nPhylogenetic analyses of combined SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, ITS rDNA, TEF1 and\nRPB2 sequence data using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and\nBayesian inference approaches placed the fungus within a strongly\nsupported clade with other Hermatomyces species within the family\nHermatomycetaceae (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes). Morphologically, it\nis similar to other taxa with only one type of conidia such as H.\nsphaericus, H. sphaericoides and H. verrucosus but molecular data\nclearly support H. trangensis as distinct from those species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115289.phy"}]}
