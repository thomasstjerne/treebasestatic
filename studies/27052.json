In this study we\nassembled a dataset of the nuclear ribosomal cistron (ca. 6000 bases\nincluding ITS1+2, ETS regions, non-transcribed spacer and associated\ngenes) for all genera in tribe Myoporeae with a particular focus on\nEremophila (207 of total 233 species of Eremophila, and 28 species of\nrelated genera sampled). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. These resolved four\nmajor clades that were well supported. Eremophila was paraphyletic, with\nall other genera of tribe Myoporeae nested in it. We discuss two\ntaxonomic options for addressing the paraphyly of Eremophila. As an\nimmediate step we propose that the small genera, Calamphoreus and\nDiocirea, should be placed in synonymy under Eremophila, and herein make\nthe necessary new nomenclatural combinations. Additional phylogenetic\ndata are needed, ideally in the form of multiple independent nuclear\nloci, to clarify the positions of Bontia, Glycocystis and Myoporum\nrelative to Eremophila before further taxonomic changes are\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"351","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI phylogeny of tribe Myoporeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_126508.phy"}]}
