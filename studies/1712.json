The AP3/DEF gene lineage has been extensively examined\nthroughout the angiosperms in order to better understand its role in\nfloral diversity and evolution. As a result, a large number of cloned\nAP3/DEF orthologues are available, which can be used for the design of\ntaxon specific primers for phylogeny reconstruction of close relatives\nof the group of interest. Following this reasoning, we investigated the\nphylogenetic utility of the two AP3/DEF paralogues (ImpDEF1 and ImpDEF2)\nthat were recently identified in the genus Impatiens (Balsaminaceae).\nK-domain introns 4 and 5 of both AP3/DEF duplicates were amplified and\nsequenced for 59 Impatiens species. Phylogenetic analyses of the\nseparated and combined ImpDEF1 and ImpDEF2 data sets result in highly\ncongruent topologies with the previously obtained chloroplast atpB-rbcL\ndata set. Combination of chloroplast and nuclear matrices results in a\nwell-supported evolutionary hypothesis of Impatiens. Our results show\nthat introns 4 and 5 in AP3/DEF-like genes are a valuable source of\ncharacters for phylogenetic studies at the infrageneric level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Impatiens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4744.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Impatiens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4743.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Impatiens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4745.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Impatiens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4746.phy"}]}
