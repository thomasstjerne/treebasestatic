However, the extraction and purification of\nmelanins from natural sources is inefficient and not adequate for large\nscale production. Alternatively, fermentative approaches based on\nfilamentous fungi cultivation can be a feasible solution. In this study,\n102 isolates of filamentous fungi were evaluated for their ability to\nproduce extracellular melanin, and a single isolate was selected. The\npromising isolate was identified as Amorphotheca resinae by\nchemotaxonomic and morphological characterization, and the melanin was\nproduced rapidly during the autolysis phase of cell growth, reaching up\n4.5 g/L. Furthermore, elemental analysis, EPR, 13C solid-state NMR, and\npyrolysis-GC-MS were carried out for structural characterization of the\nmelanin from A. resinae and comparison with standard melanins. The\nresults indicated that the structure of extracellular melanin was\nsimilar to Sepia eumelanin. Consequently, the A. resinae identified is a\ngood candidate for commercial eumelanin production.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118839.phy"}]}
