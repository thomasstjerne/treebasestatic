We investigated how these variables contribute to the\ncommunity diversity within the thalli of 405 lichens across a broad\ntaxonomic range. We found that reproductive mode is not a predictor for\ncommunity diversity of lichens using only algal photobionts, but that\ngrowth form is a strong predictor. Crustose lichens contain the highest\nphotobiont diversity, foliose lichens contain an intermediate level of\ndiversity, and fruticose lichens have the least diverse photobiont\ncommunities. We also found that lichens using cyanobacteria as\nphotobionts decrease in diversity at higher elevations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"297","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131202","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131202.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"297","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131227.phy"}]}
