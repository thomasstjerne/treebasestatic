However, some generic adjustments are still needed\nto render some genera monophyletic. In this study, we propose a new\ngenus of Malpighiaceae to accommodate the species of Tetrapterys pro\nparte, a well-supported lineage recovered by us and by the last\nphylogenetic studies for the family. Additionally, we propose the\nsynonymy of Aenigmatanthera under Niedenzuella to finally render the\nlatter monophyletic. Morphological characters related to inflorescence\narchitecture, bract and bracteole size, presence of glands on the bracts\nand bracteoles, style size and thickness, and ratio length among\nsuperior and anterior lateral wings of mericarps were key in\ncircumscribing these lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tetrapteroids","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetrapteroids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128974.phy"}]}
