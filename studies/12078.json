{"Authors":" Miao Liu, Sarah Hambeton","Year":" 2012","Title":" Laying the foundation for a taxonomic review of Puccinia\ncoronata s.l. in a phylogenetic context","Journal":" Mycolgical Progress","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" crown rust, Uredinales, phylogeny, cryptic species,\nvariety","DOI":" 10.1007/s11557-012-0814-1","Abstract":" Intra-specific classification of Puccinia coronata has\nbeen controversial, with previous approaches falling into three major\ncategories: 1. A two-species system, namely Pu. coronifera and Pu.\ncoronata; 2. The same two-species system subdivided into many formae\nspeciales, in which the host range of each is restricted to species\nwithin one genus of Poaceae; 3. A one-species system, Pu. coronata,\nsubdivided into a few varieties with host ranges that may overlap. To\nre-assess these concepts in the context of multigene analyses and\ncomparative morphological examinations, data were generated for a\ncomprehensive set of herbarium and recently collected specimens,\nrepresenting a wide range of hosts and geographic origins. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of a combined data set of DNA sequences for four loci (BT, COI,\nITS, and RPB2) revealed a high degree of genetic variation.\nMorphological differences among phylogenetic lineages were overlapping\nbut 9 lineages were differentiated using calculated means for teliospore\nand urediniospore length/width as well as measurements for the\nteliospore hilum and digitation. The taxon infecting Avena also\ncomprises collections from a wide range of other grass hosts while other\nlineages, such as those on Bromus and Agrostis, were restricted in host\nassociation. Type specimen DNA sequences included in the analyses\nresolved the placement of 5 previously described varieties. Based on\nevidence of host specificity, morphology and multigene analyses, we\nrecognized seven species, one of which was further divided into two\nvarieties. Expanded descriptions, illustrations and a synoptic key are\nprovided. A new series, Puccinia series Coronata, was erected to\naccommodate all the lineages comprising Pu. coronata sensu lato.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
