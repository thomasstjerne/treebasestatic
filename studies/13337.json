{"Authors":" Yu Ito, Norio Tanaka","Year":" 2013","Title":" Additional Potamogeton hybrids from China: Evidence from a\ncomparison of plastid trnT-trnF and nuclear ITS phylogenies","Journal":" APG: Acta Phytotaxonomica et Geobotanica","Volume":" 64","Issue":" 1","Pages":" 1-14","Keywords":" aquatic plants, hybridization, ITS, Potamogeton,\ntrnT-trnF","DOI":"","Abstract":" Hybridization is a common phenomenon in many plant genera,\nand among them is the worldâs largest aquatic genus, Potamogeton\n(Potamogetonaceae) with about 69 species and 50 hybrids reported. Here\nwe provide genetic insights into Potamogeton hybrids from China, where\nten or more putative hybrids exist, of which eight have been genetically\nconfirmed. In the study presented here, we verified the hybrid status\nand inferred the origins of three Potamogeton hybrids using molecular\nphylogenetic analyses of plastid (chloroplast) trnTâ“trnF and nuclear\nITS sequence data sets that include previously published and newly\ngenerated data. The hybrids identified were: 1) P. Ãinbaensis, a known\nhybrid from Japan; 2) a hybrid between P. perfoliatus s.l. and P.\nwrightii, and 3) a hybrid between tetraploid maternal P. distinctus and\ndiploid paternal P. octandrus. Potamogeton Ãinbaensis is reported from\nChina for the first time, whereas the latter two hybrids are new to\nscience.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
