It was found on the surface of\nTrichaptum abietinum, a small polyporous fungus, growing on the trunks\nof Pinus densiflora and Abies sp. at elevation 1,348 m in Nagano\nPrefecture, central Japan. The ITS rDNA and nrLSU sequences were\nobtained from the specimens of Japan and Far East Russia, in which the\ndifferences were one transition and one indel for ITS rDNA (ITS1 region)\nand one transition for nrLSU (D1/D2 region). A molecular phylogenetic\ntree for the related taxa based on the ITS rDNA sequences is also\nshown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeocalicium polyporaeum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114107.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeocalicium polyporaeum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114108.phy"}]}
