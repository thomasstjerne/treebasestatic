Phylogeny based on ITS, nLSU and RBP2 regions revealed that\nDatronia in current sense includes species belonging to three distantly\nrelated clades in polypores. The Datronia in a restricted sense is\nproposed for the clade including the type species D. mollis and D.\nstereoides. Neodatronia gen. nov. was proposed for two new resupinate\nspecies, N. gaoligongensis and N. sinensis. Species of Neodatronia\ndiffer from Datronia s.s. by their resupinate basidiomes, moderately to\nfrequently branched skeletal hyphae in subiculum. Datroniella gen. nov.,\ntypified by D. scutellata was proposed for species in the other clade.\nFour new species of Datroniella, D. melanocarpa, D. subtropica, D.\ntibetica and D. tropica, were identified. Species of Datroniella differ\nfrom Datronia s.s. by their moderately to frequently branched skeletal\nhyphae in context and absence of dendrohyphidia. While, differentiate\nfrom Neodatronia by their small pileate, effused-reflexed or rarely\nresupinate basidiomes and absence of dendrohyphidia. Illustrated\ndescriptions of the new species and two new genera are provided. The\nmain morphological differences between Datronia, Datroniella,\nNeodatronia and related genera are discussed, identification keys to\nrelated genera and species in each genus are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Datronia ITS, LSU and RPB2 NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118313.phy"}]}
