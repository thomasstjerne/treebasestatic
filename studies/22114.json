In the\nmarine environment, highly mobile species sometimes show structured\npatterns of diversity, but the processes isolating populations and\npromoting differentiation are often unclear. The Delphinidae (oceanic\ndolphins) are a striking case in point and, in particular, bottlenose\ndolphins (Tursiops spp.). Understanding the radiation of species in this\ngenus is likely to provide broader inference about the processes that\ndetermine patterns of biogeography and speciation, because both\nfine-scale structure over a range of kilometers and relative panmixia\nover an oceanic range are known for Tursiops populations. In our study,\nnovel Tursiops spp. sequences from the northwest Indian Ocean (including\nmitogenomes and two nuDNA loci) are included in a worldwide Tursiops\nspp. phylogeographic analysis. We discover a new ‘aduncus’ type lineage\nin the Arabian Sea (off India, Pakistan and Oman) that diverged from the\nAustralasian lineage ∼261 Ka. Effective management of coastal dolphins\nin the region will need to consider this new lineage as an\nevolutionarily significant unit. We propose that the establishment of\nthis lineage could have been in response to climate change during the\nPleistocene and show data supporting hypotheses for multiple divergence\nevents, including vicariance across the Indo-Pacific barrier and in the\nnorthwest Indian Ocean. These data provide valuable transferable\ninference on the potential mechanisms for population and species\ndifferentiation across this geographic range.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bottlenose Dolphins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109548.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bottlenose Dolphins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109482.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bottlenose Dolphins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109483.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109484","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109484.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109537.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109511.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109510.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bottlenose Dolphins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109547.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109523.phy"}]}
