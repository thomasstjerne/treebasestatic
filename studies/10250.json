Parasitoids are important regulators of arthropod\npopulations including major agricultural pests and disease vectors, and\nNasonia is an emerging genetic model, particularly for evolutionary and\ndevelopment genetics. Our key findings include identification of a\nfunctional DNA methylation toolkit, hymenopteran specific genes\nincluding diverse venoms, lateral gene transfers among Pox viruses,\nWolbachia and Nasonia, and the rapid evolution of genes involved in\nnuclear-mitochondrial interactions that are implicated in speciation.\nNewly developed genome resources have advanced the system for genetic\nresearch, accelerated mapping and cloning of quantitative trait loci\n(QTL), and will ultimately provide tools and knowledge for further\nincreasing the utility of parasitoids as pest insect control\nagents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nasonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6916.phy"}]}
