The objective of the present study is to reveal the\nevolutionary history, including key genomic events, associated with the\nvarious regions of the mat chromosomes among ten strains representing\nall the nine known species (lineages) contained within the N.\ntetrasperma species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20602","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20602.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20603","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20603.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20610.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20608.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20606.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20613.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20595.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20617","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20617.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20609.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20612.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20616","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20616.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20615","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20615.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20614","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20614.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20611.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20605.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20604","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20604.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20597.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20596.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20598","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20598.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20599.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20601.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20600.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20607.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20621","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20621.phy"}]}
