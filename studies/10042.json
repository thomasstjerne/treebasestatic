This species is characterized by less than 15\nappendages on a chasmothecium, primary branches of the appendages\noccasionally elongated and a relatively small number (2â€“5) of ascospores\nper ascus. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on rDNA ITS and 28S\nrDNA sequences indicate that this fungus forms an independent lineage in\nthe genus Erysiphe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe corylopsidis sp. nov., 28S rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5984.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe corylopsidis sp. nov., ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6622.phy"}]}
