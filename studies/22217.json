Coumarins have many biological and pharmacological\nactivities, including anti-HIV and anti-tumour effects. To\ncomprehensively evaluate M. albus and M. officinalis coumarin content,\nmorphological variation and molecular phylogeny, we examined the\ncoumarin content, five morphological traits and the molecular\ncharacterization based on trnL-F spacer and ITS regions of 93\naccessions. Significant (P<0.05) variation was observed for coumarin\ncontent and all five morphological traits in both species. Analysis of\npopulation differentiation of the phenotypic traits (Pst) showed that\npowdery mildew resistance (PMR) had the greatest Pst, which means this\ntrait possessed the largest genetic differentiation among the\naccessions. The Pst of dry matter yield (DMY) and coumarin content (Cou)\nwere relatively high. Through biplot analysis, accessions showing higher\nDMY and higher and lower coumarin content were identified. Then analysis\nof molecular sequence variation identified seven haplotypes of the\ntrnL-F spacer and 13 haplotypes of the ITS region. Based on the analysis\nof haplotypes and sequences, the genetic variation of M. officinalis was\nfound to be higher than that of M. albus. Based on the ITS sequence the\nvariation among accessions was found to be larger than that among\nspecies across the three geographical areas, Asia, Europe and North\nAmerica. Similarly for both the trnL-F and ITS sequence the variation\namong accessions was larger than differences between the 3 geographical\nareas. Our results indicate that there has been considerable gene flow\nbetween the two Melilotus species. The coumarin content, morphological\nand genetic variation of the two Melilotus species characterized in this\nstudy may provide useful insights into germplasm improvement for dry\nmatter yield and coumarin content.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gen.200000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109842","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109842.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.210000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109843","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109843.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.220000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109844","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109844.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.150000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109837.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.160000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109838.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.170000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109839.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.180000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109840.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.190000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109841.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.0+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109792","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109792.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.1000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109793.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.2000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109794","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109794.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.3000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109795.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.4000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109796.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.5000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109797.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.6000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109798.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.7000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109799.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.8000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109800.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.9000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109801.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.10000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109802.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.11000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109803.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.12000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109804.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.13000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109805.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.14000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109806.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.15000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109807.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.16000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109808.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.17000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109809.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.18000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109810.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.19000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109811.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.20000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109812.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.21000+","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109813","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109813.phy"},{"tree
