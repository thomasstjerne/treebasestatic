Confusion exists about the type species of Gnomonia\nbecause a type was not designated. Three specific names have been\nmentioned in the literature as the type species: G. gnomon, G. vulgaris\nand G. setacea. Gnomonia gnomon was designated as the lectotype species;\nhowever, some authors have considered all three taxa to be synonymous\nwith G. setacea having priority. Gnomonia vulgaris is a nomenclatural\nsynonym of G. gnomon. Observations of type specimens and fresh material\nof G. gnomon and G. setacea reveal that these two species are distinct\nand can be distinguished by the position of perithecia in the leaf\ntissue and by ascospore morphology. Descriptions and illustrations of G.\ngnomon and G. setacea are provided and an epitype specimen with ex-type\nculture for G. gnomon is designated. Distinction between G. gnomon and\nG. setacea is also supported by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnomoniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4440.phy"}]}
