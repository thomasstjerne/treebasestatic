Conidiobolus dabieensis is confirmed\nas a new species with chlamydospore within the genus Conidiobolus based\non the morphological evidence and the molecular data of LSU rDNA region.\nThe new species differs from morphologically similar Conidiobolus\nspecies: C. adiaeretus by its absence of capilliconidia, and from C.\nfirmipilleus by its slightly larger primary conidia and slender and\ncurvious germ hypha arised from a single conidium. Phylogenetic analysis\nindicates the new species closely related to C. humicolus, C.\nkhandalensis and C. firmipilleus, but distinct from the former two\nspecies by its length of primary conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101610.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101611.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101612.phy"}]}
