Workers are eyeless,\nstrictly subterranean and rarely encountered, whereas the males,\npossessing eyes and being fully winged, are collected with greater\nfrequency in pan traps, Malaise traps, or at lights. As a result of\nthese circumstances a parallel taxonomy has developed for workers and\nmales, with little or no attempt at integration of the two systems.\nMolecular markers have the potential to link the two castes and permit\nreconciliation of the two taxonomies. Here we analyze a sample of\nfourteen Leptanilla males from a single site on the island of Rhodes,\nGreece, using morphology and DNA sequence data (10 nuclear genes; 8.6 kb\nof aligned sequence data). The two sources of data are fully concordant,\nand indicate the occurrence of three sympatric species. Phylogenetic\nrelationships of these taxa and two other Leptanilla species are\nestimated using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. Two of the\nspecies, Leptanilla GR01 and Leptanilla GR03 are sister taxa in these\nanalyses, while Leptanilla GR02 is more distantly related. The sequence\ndata reveal numerous apparent apomorphies and provide an opportunity to\nidentify the corresponding workers of these Leptanilla species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptanilla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49012.phy"}]}
