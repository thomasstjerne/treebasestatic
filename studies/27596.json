In a recent\nphylogenetic treatment of 499 isolates in the culture collection (CBS)\nof the Westerdijk Institute, we evaluated the families and genera\naccommodated in this order of important fungi. The present study\npresents multigene phylogenetic analyses for an additional 230 isolates,\nusing ITS, tef1, tub2, LSU and rpb2 loci, in combination with\nmorphological data. Based on these data, 58 species are reduced to\nsynonymy, and eight novel species are described. They include Diplodia\nafrocarpi (Afrocarpus, South Africa), Dothiorella diospyricola\n(Diospyros, South Africa), Lasiodiplodia acaciae (Acacia, Indonesia),\nNeofusicoccum podocarpi (Podocarpus, South Africa), N. rapaneae\n(Rapanea, South Africa), Phaeobotryon ulmi (Ulmus, Germany), Saccharata\ngrevilleae (Grevillea, Australia) and S. hakeiphila (Hakea, Australia).\nThe results have clarified the identity of numerous isolates that lacked\nLatin binomials or had been deposited under incorrect names in the CBS\ncollection in the past. They also provide a solid foundation for more\nin-depth future studies on taxa in the order. Sequences of the tef1,\ntub2 and rpb2 genes proved to be the most reliable markers. At the\nspecies level, results showed that the most informative genes were\ninconsistent, but that a combination of four candidate barcodes (ITS,\ntef1, tub2 and rpb2) provided reliable resolution. Furthermore, given\nthe large number of additional isolates included in this study, and\nnewly generated multigene DNA datasets, several species could also be\nreduced to synonymy. The study illustrates the value of reassessing the\nidentity of older collections in culture collections utilising modern\ntaxonomic frameworks and methods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S5B.
