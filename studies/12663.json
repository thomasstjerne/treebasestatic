It plays significant roles as\nstabilizer in metabolism and is important for enzyme activation,\nstabilization of protein synthesis and neutralization of negative\ncharges on proteins. Land plants even enlarged this spectrum of K+\nutilization after having gone ashore, despite the fact that K+ is far\nless available in their new oligotrophic habitats than in sea water.\nInevitably, plant cells had to improve and to develop unique transport\nsystems for K+ accumulation and distribution. In the past two decades a\nmanifold of K+ transporters from flowering plants has been identified at\nthe molecular level. The recently published genome of the fern ally\nSelaginella moellendorffii now helps in providing a better understanding\non the molecular changes involved in the colonization of land and the\ndevelopment of the vasculature and the seeds. In this article we present\nan inventory of K+ transporters of this lycophyte. We focus especially\non transporters of the HAK and HKT type and on K+ channels, and\npigeonhole them together with their relatives from the moss\nPhyscomitrella patens, the monocytolydon Oryza sativa, the herbaceous\nplant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the tree Populus trichocarpa.\nInterestingly, the appearance of K+ release (Kout) channels in\nSelaginella that were shown in Arabidopsis to be involved in xylem\nloading and guard cell closure indicates an evolutionary step towards\nthe specialization of vascular plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Two pore channels ML tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52509","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52509.phy"},{"tree_label":"HAK channels ML tree","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52510","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52510.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single pore channels ML tree","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52511","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52511.phy"},{"tree_label":"HKT channels ML tree","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52512","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52512.phy"}]}
