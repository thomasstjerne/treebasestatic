Leaf\nanatomy of eight species of Lapeirousia and selected species of the\nother five genera of Watsonieae was examined and compared with that of\nthe putatively primitive Pillansia. Lapeirousia subg. Lapeirousia has\ncorrugate leaves that lack a distinct midvein and are anatomically\nspecialized in having predominantly or exclusively alternate vascular\nbundles and square, truncate costal ridges in which the epidermal cells\nare abruptly enlarged and often heavily thickened in the outer\npericlinal walls. This derived leaf structure correlates with the\nspecialized woody corm tunics of the subgenus. Subgenus Paniculata has\nplane leaves with a distinct midvein, vascular bundles usually opposite,\nand rounded costal ridges with epidermal cells gradually diminishing in\nsize and usually without a heavily thickened outer periclinal wall, the\nbasic type for the tribe. Species of subg. Paniculata also have hard\ncorm tunics composed of densely compacted fibers, the basic type for the\nclade including Lapeirousia. Several morphological characters within\nboth subgenera of Lapeirousia were used in the construction of a\ncladogram indicating the major lineages in the genus. This forms the\nbasis for our infrageneric classification that recognizes two subgenera,\neach with two sections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Labeirousia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1497.phy"}]}
