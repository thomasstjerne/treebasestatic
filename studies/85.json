The genera Leysera L. and Oedera L. are demonstrated to\nhave their closest relatives within Relhania Lâ€™Her., which is shown to\nbe paraphyletic as hitherto circumscribed. A revised generic\nclassification is proposed. Relhania and Leysera are redefined more\nnarrowly. Rhynchopsidium DC. and the monotypic Nestlera Sprengel are\nreestablished. Oedera is amended to include some former Relhania\nspecies. The new genus Comborhiza Anderb. & Bremer, with 2 species,\nis described, and 14 new combinations in Oedera and Comborhiza are made.\nBecause parsimony analysis produces better phylogenetic hypotheses than\nlimited selections of alleged synapomorphies, and because the latter\napproach hitherto has been more common in generic classification, it is\nargued that, with improved phylogenetic hypotheses derived from\nparsimony analysis, generic reclassifications will become necessary also\nin other groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Relhania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1494.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Relhania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1495.phy"}]}
