Loganieae includes seven\ngenera but generic boundaries remain untested and intergeneric\nrelationships are largely unknown. The chloroplast intron petD and the\nnuclear ribosomal ETS were sequenced for 37 ingroup accessions,\nincluding all genera of Loganieae, to infer generic and infrageneric\nboundaries and intergeneric relationships within the tribe. Maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian analyses resolved several strongly supported\nclades. Mitreola s. str. was placed sister to the rest of Loganieae. The\nsouth-western Australian endemic Mitreola minima B.J.Conn was placed\nsister to Mitrasacme, Schizacme and Phyllangium, rendering Mitreola\npolyphyletic. Mitrasacme, Logania section Logania and L. section\nStomandra were each strongly supported as monophyletic, but there was no\nsupport for the monophyly of Logania. Geniostoma was paraphyletic with\nrespect to a monophyletic Labordia. It is here recommended that Mitreola\nminima be afforded generic status and that the three species of Labordia\nused in this study be reduced to synonymy of Geniostoma. Additional\nsampling is needed to clarify the relationship between Logania sect.\nLogania and L. sect. Stomandra and to increase support for intergeneric\nrelationships in Loganieae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Loganieae petD, ETS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57927.phy"}]}
