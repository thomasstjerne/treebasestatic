Under high temperature and moisture conditions, there are necrotic\nspots with concentric circles and leaf becomes withered. Pathogenicity\ntests indicated that the hyphae of Microdochium sp. isolated from\ndiseased V. zizanioides plants could cause leaf spot by inoculating\nuninfected plants. Microscopic examination showed that the species was\nmorphologically distinct from related Microdochium species. Phylogenetic\ntree inferred from the combined ITS, LSU, BTUB and RPB2 sequences also\nrevealed the strain to be a novel species of Microdochium sp. Combined\nthe result of phylogenetic, pathogenicity and morphological analyses, we\nproposed a new species named M. vetiveriae for the pathogen of V.\nzizanioides in southern China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129113","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129113.phy"}]}
