The cultures were isolated from a variety of algal hosts,\nnotably the red algae Chondrus crispus, Mastocarpus stellatus and\nOsmundea species, and the brown algae Chorda filum and Fucus serratus.\nThe phylogeny revealed that the majority of isolates fell into four\ngenera in the Ulvales: Acrochaete, Ulva (sister to Acrochaete),\nBolbocoleon, and an unknown genus provisionally assigned to the\nKornmanniaceae. Acrochaete was monophyletic, with the exception of A.\nendozoica which was isolated from a shell. The genus was also more\nspecious than previously described with fourteen species, including up\nto six new species awaiting formal description. Isolates identified as\nAcrochaete repens, the type species of the genus, were polyphyletic. The\nremainder of the isolates were placed in the Ulotrichales and fell into\nup to seven new taxa. The results confirm that the endophytic habit\nsupports a broad diversity of algal taxa and suggest that blade\nformation is a relatively recent innovation within the green algae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26283","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26283.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26282.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26285.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26280.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26284.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26281","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26281.phy"}]}
