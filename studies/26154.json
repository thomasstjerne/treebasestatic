Each clade\nwas recognized as a species from the morphological characteristics and\nother features, respectively. Five species of Phyllosticta sensu stricto\nwere recognized, and two of them were newly recorded in Japanese\nmycoflora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123225.phy"}]}
