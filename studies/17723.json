A\nphylogenetic study based on morphological characters combined with\nmulti-sequence analysis of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1),\nRNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB1), RNA polymerase II second\nlargest subunit (RPB2) and the nuclear intergenic region Bloc was\ncarried out on Beauveria strains isolated in Reunion and Madagascar from\nH. marginalis. This study revealed that these strains, previously\nidentified as Beauveria brongniartii, did not match this that species\nand are closely related to but still distinct from B. malawiensis\nstrains. Therefore, we describe the Reunion Island fungus as the new\nspecies B. hoplocheli.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bloc+TEF1+RPB1+RPB2","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Beauveria hoplocheli sp. nov.
