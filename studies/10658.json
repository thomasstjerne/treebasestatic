Its macromorphology is similar to Albatrellus spp.,\nbut phylogenetic analysis based on LSU revealed that it is placed within\na clade consisting of Postia, Amylocystis and Jahnoporus where all\nspecies have white and fleshy to soft corky context and monomitic hyphal\nsystem with clamped generative hyphae. Most sequences showing high\nhomology with P. stellifera are those of brown rot polypores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Postia stellifera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9927.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Postia stellifera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9926.phy"}]}
