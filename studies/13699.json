Some\nphylogenetic systems of this alliance have been previously proposed\nbased on molecular and morphological analyses. However, several\ntaxonomic problems within this alliance as well as between it and its\nallies remain unsolved. Methodology/Principal Findings: We combinedITS,\ntrnL-F, matK, psbA-trnH, atpI-atpH, and trnS-trnfM into a single dataset\nfor the phylogenetic analysis of the Aeridesâ“Vanda alliance. The strict\nconsensus trees strongly support that the Aeridesâ“Vanda alliance is\nmonophyletic, and the 14 genera of this alliance can be grouped into the\nfollowing clades with 14 subclades: 1. Aerides, comprising two\nsubclades: Rhynchostylis and Aerides; 2. Ascocentropsis; 3.\nPapilionanthe; 4. Vanda, comprising five subclades: Neofinetia,\nChristensonia, Seidenfadenia, Ascocentrum, and Vanda-Trudelia, in which\nVanda and Trudelia form a subclade; 5. Tsiorchis, comprising the three\nsubclades Chenorchis, Tsiorchis, and two species of Ascocentrum; 6.\nParaholcoglossum; and 7. Holcoglossum. Among the 14 genera, only\nAscocentrum is triphyletic: two species of the Ascocentrum subclade, an\nindependent subclade Ascocentrum subclade in the Tsiorchis clade;\nAscocentrum subclade in the Vanda clade; and one species in the\nHolcoglossum clade. The Vanda and Trudelia species belong to the same\nsubclade. The molecular conclusion is consistent with their\nmorphological characters. Conclusions: We elucidated the relationship\namong the 14 genera of the Aeridesâ“Vanda alliance. Our phylogenetic\nresults revealed that the Aeridesâ“Vanda alliance is monophyletic, but\nit can be divided into 14 genera. The data proved that Ascocentrum is\ntriphyletic. Plants with elongate-terete leaves and small flowers should\nbe treated as a new genus, Pendulorchis. Saccolabium himalaicum\n(Ascocentrum himalaicum) should be transferred to Pendulorchis.\nAscocentrum pumilum, endemic to Taiwan, should be transferred to\nHolcoglossum. A new combination, Holcoglossum pumilum, was also\nestablished. Trudelia should not be recognized as an independent genus.\nTwo new species, Pendulorchis gaoligongense and Holcoglossum\nsingchianum, were described as well.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59292","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59292.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59295","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_59295.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59287.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59288.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59289.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59291.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59290.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59294.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epidendroideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59293.phy"}]}
