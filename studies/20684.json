Symptoms of these diseases have\nincreasing been observed over the past few years. In order to assess the\ncurrent status of Diaporthe on grapevines in the Western Cape Province\nof South Africa, isolations were made from dormant grafted nursery\nvines, dormant rootstock canes and dying or dead spurs of field vines.\nCultures identified as Diaporthe based on morphological features were\nidentified to species level by sequencing the internal transcribed\nspacer region and, for a representative sub-sample of isolates, the\nbeta-tubulin region. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined ITS and\nbeta-tubulin data revealed nine Diaporthe species associated with\ngrapevines during this survey, of which one represents an undescribed\nspecies and three others are reported on grapevines in South Africa for\nthe first time (D. novem, D. cynaroidis and D. serafiniae).\nMorphological features of pycnidia produced in culture were measured and\ncompared with published descriptions. Three sets of species-specific\nprimers were designed for PCR identification of D. ampelina, D. ambigua\nand D. foeniculina, which were the most common species. Pathogenicity\nstudies conducted on detached grapevine shoots indicated that, of the\nspecies tested D. ampelina, D. novem and the new sp. were the most\npathogenic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113195","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113195.phy"}]}
