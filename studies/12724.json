Monophyly of\nFringillidae and its two constituent subfamilies, Fringillinae and\nEmberizinae, was consistently supported with the exceptions of\nPeucedramus being placed outside of Fringillinae and Euphonia being\nplaced within Fringillinae instead of within Emberizinae. Within\nEmberizinae, Thraupini (tanagers), Cardinalini (cardinals and\ngrosbeaks), and Emberizini (New World sparrows) did not form separate\nmonophyletic groups. Our results indicate that Emberizinae consists of\nthree clades, each with a different overall geographical distribution.\nSeveral taxa traditionally considered members of Thraupini fall outside\nof the thraupine clade, including the only North American genus,\nPiranga. Consequently, the thraupine clade includes only Neotropical\nspecies. Increasing evidence suggests that Fringillidae, often called\n“New World nine-primaried oscines,” does not in fact have a New World\norigin.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fringillidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52916.phy"}]}
