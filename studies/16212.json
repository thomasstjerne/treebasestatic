However, the functioning and evolutionary\nhistory of immune-related genes remains unknown for most invertebrate\nspecies. A striking observation coming from the analysis of the pea\naphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genome is the absence of important conserved\ngenes known to be involved in the antimicrobial responses of other\ninsects. This reduction in antibacterial immune defences is thought to\nbe related to their long-term association with beneficial symbiotic\nbacteria and to facilitate symbiont maintenance. An additional\npossibility to avoid elimination of mutualistic symbionts is a\nfine-tuning of the host immune response. To explore this hypothesis we\ninvestigated the existence and potential involvement of immune\nregulators in aphid agonistic and antagonistic interactions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76850","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76850.phy"}]}
