Using a combination of\nmicro-morphological characters and ITS and multi-gene (nr SSU, nr LSU,\nEF1-Î±, RPB1 and RPB2) phylogeny, the isolates were classified as seven\ntaxa, three of which were previously undescribed, and one of them was a\nfirst record in Japan. The new species P. boninensis and two new\nvarieties of P. chlamydosporia var. ellipsospora and var. spinulospora\nwere recovered from the Chichi-jima, Aogashima, or Okinawaâs main\nisland. The three new taxa are distinguished from known species and\nvarieties by conidial morphology. The finding of P. rubescens was a\nfirst for Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr58282","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58282.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr58284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58284.phy"}]}
