We investigated 52 rust fungi representing 9 families and\nthree outgroup species. Neighbor joining analysis and a Bayesian method\nof phylogenetic inference using Monte Carlo Markov chains confirm (1)\nthe rust fungi as natural group and indicate that (2) Puccinia,\nUromyces, Endophyllum, and Cumminsiella have a common origin. (3) The\nautoecious Rosaceae-rusts Phragmidium, Kuehneola, Triphragmium, and\nTrachyspora are a monophyletic group. (4) The gasteroid genus Ochropsora\nis closely related to Tranzschelia. (5) The Pucciniastreae sensu Dietel\n(1938) are recognized as a monophyletic group in neighbor joining\nanalysis, while (6) the Pucciniaceae s.l. (Dietel 1928) are supported by\nBayesian analysis. (7) The following genera appear to be monophyletic:\nChrysomyxa, Coleosporium, Cronartium, Gymnosporangium, Melampsora,\nPhragmidium, and Tranzschelia, whereas (8) the genera Puccinia,\nPucciniastrum, Thekopsora and Uromyces are not.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Uredinales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4022.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Uredinales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4023.phy"}]}
