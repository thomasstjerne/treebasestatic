Because morphological species\nrecognition in fungi can hide diversity, we applied a phylogenetic\napproach to search for cryptic species. We examined 23 isolates from the\nSan Francisco Bay Area, and another seven from around the US. Using\nmarkers we developed for three polymorphic protein coding loci (chitin\nsynthase 1, beta-tubulin 2, and trichodiene synthase 5), we infer that\ntwo distinct phylogenetic species exist within the single described\nmorphological species. We have found no correlation between genetic\nisolation and geographic distance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stachybotrys chartarum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4007.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stachybotrys chartarum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4008.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stachybotrys chartarum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4009.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stachybotrys chartarum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4010.phy"}]}
