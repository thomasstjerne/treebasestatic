New\nmolecular phylogenetic and divergence analyses presented here show that\ndispersal and diversification in Caribbean bats are synchronous with sea\nlevel drops during inter-stage transitions in the Miocene. The\nphylogenies indicate that several continental bat species descended from\nWest Indian ancestors, as the exceptionally low sea level of the Miocene\ntransitions allowed for two-way biotic exchange between the islands and\nthe continent. These results suggest a common mechanism underlies\ncolonization and subsequent speciation in the Caribbean, and underscore\nthe importance of geological history in all biogeographic scenarios,\nincluding dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule consensus of Bayesian trees","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52819","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52819.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule consensus of Bayesian trees","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52820","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52820.phy"}]}
