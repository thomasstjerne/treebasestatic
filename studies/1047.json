RPB1 and RPB2\nnucleotide sequences of the holotype of I. angustispora support a close\nphylogenetic relationship between this species and Cortinarius croceus\nof subgenus Dermocybe, also evident by the shared presence of\ninterhyphal pigment deposits. A taxonomic description, illustrations,\nand gene phylogenies are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 RPB1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe & Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4193.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 RPB2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe & Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4194.phy"}]}
