Field collections included 20 of the 33 known\nhost associations and resulted in discovery of four new associations.\nPhylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets were in\ngeneral agreement, resulting in a well resolved Fahrenholzia phylogeny.\nAnalyses supported monophyly of lice parasitizing the host subfamily\nHeteromyinae (spiny pocket mice), and lice parasitizing the genera\nChaetodipus (pocket mice) and Perognathus (silky pocket mice) each\nrepresent monophyletic lineages. Phylogenetic patterns and levels of\ngenetic differentiation suggest that the widespread species F. pinnata\nmay contain several cryptic species. Cryptic species also may exist\nwithin the less widely distributed species, F. microcephala and F.\nreducta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COI EF1 MPboot","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_568.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI EF1 MP","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_569.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI MP MajRul","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_662.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI MP boot","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_663.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a MP con","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2550.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a ML boot","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2551.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a Bayes","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fahrenholzia sucking lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2554.phy"}]}
