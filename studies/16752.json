Recent studies have suggested greater species richness\nin tropical Asia than previously envisaged. We used morphological,\ncytological, and molecular phylogenetic analyses to confirm the\nexistence of a novel, cryptic species of the Nervilia adolphiÂ–punctata\nspecies alliance in southwest Japan, supporting earlier findings from a\ngenetic fingerprinting study. Nervilia futago is formally described and\nillustrated here. In the vegetative state, the new species is\npractically inseparable from the more widespread N. nipponica, with\nwhich it co-occurs at several sites, but it can be distinguished in\nflower by its glabrous petals, by the lack of tall clavate hairs on the\nlip, and by the placement of the pollinia on the stigma prior to\nanthesis. Chromosome numbers and DNA content also differ. Despite their\nwide geographic separation, sequence data indicate greater affinity of\nN. futago to Himalayan members of the alliance than to other species of\nEast Asia. The utility of genetic approaches in resolving identities and\nrelationships in this taxonomically intractable genus is\nemphasised.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79964.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79959.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79957.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79962.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79958.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79960.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79961.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79963.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Nervilia (Orchidaceae)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79965.phy"}]}
