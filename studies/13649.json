Abundant\nepibionts were previously described as coating the exterior of M.\nbactericola, which is found within the anoxic sulfide-oxidizing\nmicrobial mats of the Santa Barbara Basin, California, USA. 16S rRNA\ninvestigation of the bacterial community associated with this polychaete\ndiscovered the presence of bacteria belonging to Mesorhizobium. We\nidentified these bacteria using phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA and\nthree additional functional genes, nifH, atpD, and recA, and\ngroup-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).","trees":[{"tree_label":"recA Maximum Likelihood Tree with Bootstrap\nSupport","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58950","tree_kind":"Species
