Considering that the abundance of large\nterrestrial herbivores increased on the African continent with the\nexpansion of grassland and savannah ecosystems, modified sterile flowers\ncould have been an innovation that boosted the diversification of an\nAfrican Achyranthoid clade of Amaranthaceae, with large animals serving\ndispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108548","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108548.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108549","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108549.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCC tree","ntax":"189","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MCC tree of post-burn-in posterior tree distribution\ninferred with BEAST","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108364.phy"}]}
