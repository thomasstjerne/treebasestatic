Contrary to this morphologically-based\ntaxonomy, previous plastid DNA data have shown that O. regalis is\nparaphyletic, with the American O. regalis sister to O. japonica and O.\nlancea. It remains to be confirmed whether this paraphyletic topology\nresults from hybridization, budding speciation, or classification\nissues. To clarify the evolutionary history of O. regalis and O.\njaponica, we performed multiple molecular phylogenetic analyses using 38\nworldwide samples and sequences from 15 nuclear and six plastid DNA\nregions. The phylogenetic trees of the nuclear and plastid single-region\nanalyses were incongruent. Phylogenetic networks were also discordant\nbetween the nuclear and plastid regions. Statistical analysis for\ndetecting the introgressed sequences found hybridization signals between\nthe American O. regalis and O. japonica lineage, particularly in plastid\nregions. Along with the paleobotanical data, the results suggest that\nthe ancient introgression occurred at an estimated time of 12.8Â–4.1 Ma in\nEast Asia, when and where both species coexisted. Post-hybridization\ngeographical fluctuation led to the present amphi-Pacific distribution\npattern. The phylogenetic network suggests that the New World O. regalis\nspread across continents in a relatively short time, while the Old World\nO. regalis experienced long-term geographical isolation between\n(sub)continents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
