Of the ~700 described taxa 71 are included\nin a phylogenetic analysis using the chloroplast rbcL gene and the\ntrnL-F spacer. Our results support Hymenasplenium as the sister lineage\nto all other asplenioid ferns, and all other putative satellite genera\nare nested within this asplenioid clade. Instead of the classical and\nwell-recognized separation into Old and New World clades asplenioid\nferns reveal a separation of the deeper branches into tropical and\ntemperate clades. Temperate clades have evolved from tropical,\nmore-basal clades and the phylogeny indicates up to six shifts between\ntemperate and tropical preferences in the evolution of this widespread\ngenus. Implications for speciation processes and biogeographic aspects\nincluding the re-colonization of temperate regions after the last\nglacial period are discussed and we present a phylogenetic framework\nfrom which the historical biogeography of asplenioid ferns can be\ninferred for Europe and North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1762.phy"}]}
