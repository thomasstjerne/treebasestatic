Sequence data obtained from the\nsmall subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU nrDNA) place this fungus with 100%\nbootstrap support in a clade containing the type species of\nRhynchostoma, R. minutum. Another similar fungus with verruculose\nascospores was also observed on a member of the Proteaceae from\nAustralia, Lomatia polymorpha, which is described here as Rhynchomeliola\nlomatiae sp. nov. These two species are illustrated and contrasted to a\nthird species from Proteaceae, Rhynchomeliola australiense, known from\nGrevillea in Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 29","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic placement of Rhynchostoma proteae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5774.phy"}]}
