We applied both\nphylogenetic and biological species recognition to a collection of\nstrains representing the diversity of N. tetrasperma. First, we were\nable to confirm a monophyletic origin of N. tetrasperma. Furthermore, we\nfound nine phylogenetic species within the morphospecies. When using the\ntraditional broad biological species recognition all investigated\nstrains of N. tetrasperma constituted a single biological species. In\ncontrast, when using a quantitative measurement of the reproductive\nsuccess, incorporating characters such as viability and fertility of\noffspring, we found that the phylogenetic and biological species limits\noverlap. Taken together, phylogenetically and biologically defined\ngroups of individuals exist in N. tetrasperma, and these should be taken\ninto account in future studies of its life history traits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma species phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6054.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma, het-c","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6251.phy"}]}
