The familial placement is tested through the\ninclusion of Cauquenia in the lastest major morphological analyses of\nthe superfamily Lycosoidea published to date, the subfamily placement of\nthe South American zoropsid genus Itatiaya Mello-LeitÃ£o is also tested\nincluding them in the Raven and Stumkat (2005) analysis. Cauquenia and\nItatiaya are closely related to the African genera Griswoldia\nDippenaar-Schoeman & JocquÃ© and Phanotea Simon, with which it\nshares a cup-shaped median apophysis on the male pedipalp and tooth-like\nprojections on the lateral lobes of the epigyne in females. The patterns\nof evolution of cribellum and male tibial crack in Lycosoidea are\nexplored, the cribellum shows up as primitive present, with tree losses\nand four independt adquicitions, the mail tibial crack is lost twice.\nAsymmetric cost in cribellum gain:loss of 6:1 produce a primitive\ncribellum with 12 losses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycosoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120060.phy"}]}
