A total of\n72 leaf samples were obtained from two orchards in the Waikato region of\nthe North Island of New Zealand and tested by reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus-specific RT-PCR,\nsequencing and mechanical inoculation on herbaceous host plants detected\nthe presence of CLRV in three samples. This is the first report of CLRV\non apple in New Zealand. Based on a thorough review of literature,\nresults obtained in this study may likely represent the first case of\nCLRV in apple.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CLRV","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cherry leafroll virus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52949.phy"}]}
