Among the mix of secreted\nproteins are an expanded, lineage-specific family of protein kinases\ntermed rhoptry kinases (ROPKs), several of which have been shown to be\nkey virulence factors, including the pseudokinase ROP5. The extent and\ndetails of the diversification of this protein family are poorly\nunderstood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ROPK Subfamilies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63497.phy"}]}
