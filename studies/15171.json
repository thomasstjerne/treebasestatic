The\ndata are in excellent agreement that Poecilanthe is paraphyletic with\nrespect to other genera of the tribe Brongniartieae. Each of the three\nindependent lineages of Poecilanthe sensu lato combines a morphological,\ngeographical, and ecological distinction. They will be ranked at the\ngenus level and Poecilanthe sensu stricto is recircumscribed to\nencompass the extra-Amazonian species that occur in highly seasonal dry\nforests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poecilanthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69461.phy"}]}
