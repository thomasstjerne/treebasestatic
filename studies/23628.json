Coalescent simulations integrating species\ndistribution models and population genetics showed that the post-glacial\nassembly of European bryophytes involves a complex history from multiple\nsources. The contribution of allochtonous migrants is estimated at\n95-100% of extant populations in about half of the investigated species,\nwhich is consistent with the globally balanced genetic diversities and\nextremely low divergence observed among biogeographic regions. Such a\nsubstantial contribution of allochtonous migrants in the post-glacial\nassembly of European bryophyte floras is unparalleled in other plants\nand animals. The limited role of northern micro-refugia, which was\nunexpected based on bryophyte life-history traits, and of southern\nrefugia, is consistent with recent paleontological evidence that the\nfull-glacial landscape of Eurasia was largely treeless.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114934","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114934.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114935.phy"}]}
