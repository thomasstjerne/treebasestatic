The species has suffered declining numbers following\nthe introduction of goats to the island over 150 years ago. Callitropsis\nguadalupensis is closely related to Callitropsis forbesii (Tecate\ncypress), distributed in small isolated populations in mainland Baja\nCalifornia and southern California. The objective of the present study\nwas to compare the genetic diversity of the island endemic to the more\nwidely distributed continental species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Island Endemic Guadalupe Cypress","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_25890.phy"}]}
