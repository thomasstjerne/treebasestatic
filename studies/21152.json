Ripidium (Tripidium)\nspecies into sugarcane based on both genera being part of the ‘Saccharum\nComplex’, an interbreeding group of species believed to be involved in\nthe origins of sugarcane. However, recent low copy gene studies indicate\nthat Tripidium and Saccharum are much more divergent than previously\nthought. The extent of genus Tripidium has not been fully explored and\nmany species that should be in Tripidium are still classified as\nSaccharum. Moreover, Tripidium is currently defined as incertae sedis\nwithin the Andropogoneae. For the first time, we have undertaken a\nlarge-scale whole plastid study of eight newly-assembled potential\nTripidium species. Our findings show that Tripidium and Saccharum are 11\nmillion years divergent and we prove that four species should be removed\nfrom Saccharum/Erianthus and included in genus Tripidium. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that Tripidium is sister to a clade formed by\nRottboelliinae, Ischaeminae and Coicinae. We re-define the ‘Saccharum\ncomplex’ to a group of genera that can interbreed in the wild and extend\nthe Saccharinae to include the Sorghinae along with Pogonatherum and\nImperata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105252","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105252.phy"}]}
