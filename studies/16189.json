Here, we use high throughput\nsequencing to determine three mitochondrial genomes of Acanthochitonina.\nWe further explore phylogenetic relationships with expanded taxon\nsampling based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data. Phylogenetic\nanalyses recover two major lineages roughly corresponding to\nCryptoplacoidea and Mopalioidea, but the necessity of reassigning\nmultiple genera challenges their conventional definition and that of the\nfamilies Mopaliidae, Schizoplacidae and Lepidochitonidae. Two\nmitogenomes share a gene rearrangement that might represent a\nsynapomorphy for Lepidochitonidae. Our phylogenetic results support the\nreinterpretation of certain morphological characters as homologous,\npreviously assumed to be convergent. They further reveal that major\nAcanthochitonina lineages were restricted to particular ocean basins,\nwhere they diverged into endemisms with disparate morphology. Our\nresults are corroborated by morphological and biogeographical evidence\nand contribute toward resolving the phylogenetic relationships of\nAcanthochitonina, and highlight the need for further phylogenetic and\nsystematic studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML mitogenome nt","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76752.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian MRC mitogenome aa","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76753.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian MRC mitogenome nt","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76750.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML mitogenome aa","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76751.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian MRC multilocus nt","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76755.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML multilocus aa","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76756.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML multilocus nt","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian MRC multilocus aa","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthochitonina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76754.phy"}]}
