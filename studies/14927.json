(Helotiales, Ascomycota), an\nendophytic fungus associated with Abies spp. in China and Europe","Journal":" Mycoscience","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Fungal endophytes; Molecular phylogeny; Phenotypic\ndivergence","DOI":"","Abstract":" A new species of Pezicula, P. neosporulosa associated with\nAbies alba in the Netherlands and A. beshanzuensis in China is\ndescribed, illustrated and compared to its sister species P. sporulosa,\nP. cinnamomea and P. eucrita. Morphologically, P. neosporulosa is shown\nto be similar to P. sporulosa both in sexual and asexual sporulating\nstructures. However, from China the species is only known from\nendophytic isolates, and sporulating structures were never obtained in\nthem . In contrast to the three sister species, the new species does not\nproduce microconidia directly from ascospores or from macroconidia, but\nonly from conidiophores in conidiomata. Moreover, the colony appearance\nis highly variable in endophytic isolates. Bayesian, maximum parsimony\nand maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses based on four unlinked loci\n(ITS, RPB2, TEF-1Î± and Î²-tubulin) in concatenated datasets confirmed\nthat all isolates in P. neosporulosa were well separated from closely\nallied species with high bootstrap value and posterior probability.\nTaken together, the molecular and morphological evidence supports the\nintroduction of P. neosporulosa s as a novel taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67920.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67919.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phylogenetic multigene analysis of ITS, RPB2, TEF1-?\nand ?-tubulin sequences of Pezicula species.","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67922.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67931","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67931.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67932","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67932.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67933","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67933.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phylogenetic multigene analysis of ITS, RPB2, TEF1-?\nand ?-tubulin sequences of Pezicula species.","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67934","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67934.phy"}]}
