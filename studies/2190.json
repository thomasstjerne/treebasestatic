In spite of the geographically separated samplings, high sequence\nsimilarity was found among the obtained DNA sequences, which suggested\nthat S. sikokianus might be highly specialized to the group of fungi. It\nis known that Sebacina spp. are saprobes or ectomycorrhiza forming\nfungi. The mycorrhizal fungi of S. sikokianus were regarded to be\nsaprobic from environments of the habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sebacinaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5392.phy"}]}
