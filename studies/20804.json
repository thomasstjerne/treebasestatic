In this paper, a\nchecklist of Amazonian Cyathus species with detailed descriptions and\nillustrations of five uncommon species are given. A new species named C.\nalbinus is proposed, and three other species are recorded for the first\ntime from their localities. Also, polyphyly is detected into Striatum\ninfra-generic group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus albinus ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106913.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106910.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus albinus ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106911.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyathus albinus ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106912.phy"}]}
