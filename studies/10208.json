To obtain insights about the origin of this groundplan, the\nevoultion of its structural components in Hamamelidoideae\n(Hamamelidaceae, Saxifragales, core eudicots) is explored. Phylogenetic\nhypotheses were obtained from independent analyses of morphological and\nmolecular data, and from two alternative approaches to integrating\nmorphological and molecular data from living and fossil taxa. In spite\nof being largely incomplete, fossils were unambiguously placed within\nparticular clades in the well resolved trees obtained from morphological\ndata. Phylogenetic analyses of individual and combined molecular data\nsets using different optimization criteria resulted in congruent trees\nthat share most of their strongly supported nodes. Although\nmorphological and molecular trees depict different relationships, no\nsupported incongruence exists. A total evidence analysis including only\ncomplete taxa was congruent with molecular trees but resolution\ndecreased substantially as incomplete taxa and incomplete characters\nwere included. A parsimony analysis of morphological data constrained\nwith the strongly supported nodes from the total evidence tree resulted\nin the same backbone relationships as the molecular trees and in the\nunambiguous placement of incomplete taxa, however, relationships within\nsome clades were unique. The floral characters of ancient fossils and\ntheir nested placement in the phylogeny indicate morphological stasis\nsince the origin of major lineages of Hamamelidoideae. Individual floral\nstructural elements display independent evolutionary histories,\nsuggesting that the core eudicot floral groundplan evolved through the\naccretion of structural components which originated at different points\nduring angiosperm history, some outside eudicots, and others, namely the\nbipartite perianth and the pentamerous merosity, most likely within core\neudicots.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPrbcL","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids rbcL MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6655.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLmatK","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids matK ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6658.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPmatK","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids matK MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6208.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6645.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids 4genes_MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6110.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLspac","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids spacer ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6154.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPatpB","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids atpB MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6421.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids 4genes ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6068.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLrbcL","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids rbcL ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6661.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLatpB","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids atpB ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6680.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPspac","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids spacer MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6317.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids morphology_MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6277.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelids TotalEvidence1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6361.phy"}]}
