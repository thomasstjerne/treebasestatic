Today it is\nwidely accepted that land plants (embryophytes) evolved from\nstreptophyte algae, also referred to as charophycean algae. The\nstreptophyte algae are a paraphyletic group of green algae, ranging from\nunicellular flagellates to morphologically complex forms such as\nstoneworts (Charales). The latter are often considered to be the sister\ngroup of the embryophytes. For a better understanding of the evolution\nof land plants, it is of prime importance to identify the streptophyte\nalgae that are sister-group to the embryophytes. However, despite many\nyears of phylogenetic studies this question has not been resolved and\nremains controversial.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Origin of land plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47409.phy"}]}
