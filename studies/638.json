Species of the genera Ornithoptera and Troides in the\nstudy were shown to be closely related. Species of the subgenus\nOrnithoptera also displayed a very close relationship, as well as\nspecies of the subgenus Schoenbergia. The genera Pachliopta and Losaria,\nas well as Atrophaneura and Byasa, were suggested to be closely related.\nOn the other hand, Battus is excluded from the Troidini\nphylogenetically. the common ancestor of Ornithoptera and Troides was\nsupposed to have evolved either in the region that includes Australia\nand New Guinea Island, or in a part of South-east Asia, and diverged\ninto the two genera before or after the time when fragments of\nGondwanaland collided against Asia.
