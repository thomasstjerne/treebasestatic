This first paper focuses on 21 genera\nof phytopathogenic fungi: Bipolaris, Boeremia, Calonectria,\nCeratocystis, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Coniella, Curvularia,\nMonilinia, Neofabraea, Neofusicoccum, Pilidium, Pleiochaeta, Plenodomus,\nProtostegia, Pseudopyricularia, Puccinia, Saccharata, Thyrostroma,\nVenturia and Wilsonomyces. For each genus, a morphological description\nand information about its pathology, distribution, hosts and disease\nsymptoms are provided. In addition, this information is linked to\nprimary and secondary DNA barcodes of the presently accepted species,\nand relevant literature. Moreover, several novelties are introduced,\ni.e.Â new genera, species and combinations, and neo-, lecto- and epitypes\ndesignated to provide a stable taxonomy. This first paper includes one\nnew genus, 26 new species, nine new combinations, and four typifications\nof older names.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"190","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytopathogenic fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_104288.phy"}]}
