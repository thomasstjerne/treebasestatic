We accept 24 genera in\nDiatrypaceae with 19 genera involved in the phylogram and the other five\ngenera are lacking living materials with available sequences. Eleven\nspecies include in four genera (viz.Â Allocryptovalsa, Diatrype,\nEutypella and Allodiatrypella gen. nov.) have been isolated from seven\nhosts species, of which ten novel species (Allocryptovalsa castanea,\nAllodiatrypella betulae, A. betulicola, A. betulina, A. hubeiensis, A.\nxinjiangensis, Diatrype betulae, D. castaneicola, D. querquecina and\nEutypella castaneicola) are introduced in this study, while Eutypella\ncitricola is a new record from Morus host. Current results show the high\ndiversity of members of Diatrypaceae species which are wood-inhabiting\nfungi in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceous fungi ITS tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129689.phy"}]}
