The first species is characterized by its\nascospores with two widely separated equatorial crests and tuberculate\nto verrucose convex surfaces. This has affinities with several known\nspecies of the genus, bearing ascospores with a similar ornamentation,\nbut can be distinguished from these species by other morphological\ncharacteristics such as smaller cleistothecia and conidiophores,\nspathulate vesicles and rather ellipsoidal codidia. The second species\nis characterized by its unique ascospores with two low equatorial\ncrests, evident furrow as a deep depression and finely reticulate convex\nsurfaces. The validation of these new species is supported further by\nanalyses of the b-tubulin, calmodulin and actin gene sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neosartorya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6941.phy"}]}
