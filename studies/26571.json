The results obtained showed\nstrong evidence for the polyphyly of Flourensia identifying two\nwell-supported groups: Flourensia, a clade from North America including\nthe type F. laurifolia, and another clade, here designed as the new\ngenus Austroflourensia, containing the South American species.\nAustroflourensia is related to the other four genera composing the\nsubtribe Enceliinae, whereas Flourensia s.s. is sister to all of them.\nAustroflourensia can be mainly distinguished by having a shrubby or\nsubshrubby habit, capitula always radiate usually arranged in weakly\ncymose-corymbose capitulescences, phyllaries 23-seriate, and disc\ncorollas shortly dentate. This paper proposes twelve new combinations to\naccommodate species previously described in the genus Flourensia and\nprovides emended descriptions of Flourensia and the new genus\nAustroflourensia. The illustration of the type of the new genus, a\ndistribution map, and a key to the genera of Enceliinae are also\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE
