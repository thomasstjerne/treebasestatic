This endophytic fungus,isolated from a leaf\nof Japanese andromeda (Pieris japonica), has knob-tipped appendages on\nthe apical and basal cells of the conidia. The conidial morphology is\nsimilar to that of Pestalotiopsis theae except that the color of the\nmedian cells is paler in P. pallidotheae. Molecular analyses of the\nITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2 site placed P. pallidotheae in a group different\nfrom P. theae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6854.phy"}]}
