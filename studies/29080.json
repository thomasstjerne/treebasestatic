This\npaper reports our research result of diversity, taxonomy and phylogeny\nof anamorphic Chaetosphaeriaceae in China, which is based on a\nsystematic study by using the integrated approach of morphological\nobservation and phylogenetic analysis for a large collection (>1500\nherbarium specimens and 1200 living strains). The family\nChaetosphaeriaceae is further expanded to accomendate 91 accepted\ngenera, including 24 new genera and 10 newly assigned genera. Most of\nthese genera (except for Chaetosphaeria and several other relatively\nlarge genera) are delimitated as monophyletic genera with well-defined\ndiagnostic morphological characters. The phylogenetic connection of\nnon-phialidic Sporidesmium-like fungi with the family is further\nconfirmed and expanded to 10 different genera. The polyphyletic\nCodinaea/Dictyochaeta complex is partly resolved with a taxonomic\nframework of 27 monophyletic genera by redelimitation of Codinaea and\nDictyochaeta in narrow concept, acceptance of 11 established genera, and\nfinally introduction of 14 several new genera. Chloridium is\nphylogenetically redefined as monophyletic genus with narrow concept as\ntypified by the type species, a systematic review in both generic and\nspecies level is still needed for the genus. Revision is also made for\nseveral published Chaetosphaeria species. For biodiversity of\nchaetosphaeriaceous fungi, a total of 372 species in 77 genera,\nincluding 129 new species, 56 new combinations, and 1 new name, are\nfully documented in this paper and the identification keys are provided\nfor most genera. One of the future research area for this family should\nbe systematic revision of several relatively large polyphyletic genera,\nincluding Ellisembia, Stanjehughesia, Cacumisporium, Chaetosphaeria,\nChloridium, Craspedodidymum, Cryptophiale, Cryptophialoidea,\nDictyochaetopsis, Minimidochium, and many published species of Codinaea\nand Dictyochaeta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134701","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134701.phy"}]}
