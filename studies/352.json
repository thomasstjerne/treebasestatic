The\nunsegmented, mud-dwelling echiuran spoon worms and the gutless, deep-sea\npogonophoran tube worms (including vestimentiferans) share several\nembryological and morphological features with annelids, but each group\nalso has been considered as a separate metazoan phylum based on the\nunique characters each group displays. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA\nsequencdes from the nuclear gene elongation fatctor-1a place echiurans\nand pogonophorans within the Annelida. This result, indicating the\nderived loss of segmentation in echiurnas, has profound implications for\nour understanding of the evolution of metazoan body plans and challenges\nthe traditional view of the phylum-level diversity and evolutionary\nrelationships of protosome worms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protostomia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5500.phy"}]}
