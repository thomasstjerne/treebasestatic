The sample was isolated from biopsy fragments of\ndisseminated lesions on the skin of a pediatric patient with acute\nmyeloid leukemia. The study of the virulence factors showed that the\nstrain was not able to produce the enzymes proteinase, phospholipase and\nhemolysin. The isolate was characterized as low biofilm producer. With\nthe exception of amphotericin B and voriconazole, the sample presented\nhigh values of minimum inhibitory concentration against azole and\nechinocandins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichosporon veenhuisii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114074.phy"}]}
