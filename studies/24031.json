It is also the\ntype species of a large genus of plant pathogens that cause severe wilt\nand stem canker diseases on many tree species. A previously published\ngenome of this species (isolate CBS114723) was based on 454 sequence\ndata, which had a size of 29.4 Mb, 20x genome coverage and an N50 value\nof 42.9 kb. In this study, the genome sequence of the same isolate was\ndetermined using Illumina HiSeq technology. This resulted in a genome\nsize of 30.1 Mb with more than 630x coverage, and an N50 value of 173.7\nkb. In addition, this study provides the first curated gene predictions\nof C. fimbriata<>, incorporating RNA sequence data as evidence.\nA total of 7284 protein coding genes were predicted of which 71%\ncontained Pfam domains and 62% had functional assignments. This genome\nannotation will provide a basis for the annotation of other species\nwithin Ceratocystidaceae and thus allow for the investigation of\nevolutionary questions in this genus.","\n":"","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microascales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116141.phy"}]}
