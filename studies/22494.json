A number of these rare traits show a\ndistinct tippy pattern, where they appear widely dispersed across a\nphylogeny, are concentrated along the tips of short branches, and often\ndo not have the same trait state as their sister species. This\nphylogenetic pattern has classically been attributed to the trait being\nan evolutionary dead end, where the trait arose due to some short-term\nevolutionary advantage, but it ultimately leads species to extinction.\nWhile the higher extinction rate associated with a dead end trait could\nproduce such a tippy pattern, a similar pattern could have also arisen\nif lineages with the trait speciated slower than other lineages, or if\nthe trait was lost more often that it was gained. In this study, we\ninvestigate the macroevolutionary processes that best explain the rare\nand tippy distribution of red flowers in the Solanaceae family. We test\n16 alternative models using HiSSE, which allows the inclusion of models\nwith multiple diversification rates. We found the best model to be one\nwhere lineages with red flowers exhibit reduced diversification rates\ndue to elevated extinction rates and a bias towards loss of red flowers.\nThese results suggest that red Solanaceae flowers are rare and tippy due\nto a combination of processes, including being an evolutionary dead\nend.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"1350","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110753.phy"}]}
