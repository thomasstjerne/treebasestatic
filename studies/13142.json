The described material belongs to two\njunvenile individuals. Recent field work has provided new cranial and\npost-cranial material. This new material presents a combination of\nplesiomorphic and apomorphic eusauropod characters adding more data to\nthe skull and post-cranial skeletal morphology. A phylogenetic analysis\n(237 characters, 39 taxa: 16 parsimonious trees of 479 steps, CI = .53,\nRI-.73) (Läng 2008) indicates an unsolved phylogenetic position of\nChebsaurus within the non-neosauropod Eusauropoda. Indeed, Chebsaurus is\npositioned in a multifurcuration with Middle Jurassic ‘cetiosaurids’\nLapparentosaurus madagascariensis, Ferganasaurus verzilini, Cetiosaurus\nmogrebiensis, and Cetiosaurus oxoniensis from Oxford. This polytomy\ncould be explained by numerous missing data and also from evolutive\nradiation that might have succeeded the extinction at the end of the\nEarly Jurassic (Pliensbachian - Toarcian) and/or the Pangea\nbreak-up.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 22","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55674.phy"}]}
