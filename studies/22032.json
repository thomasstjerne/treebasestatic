A phylogeny based on available\nsequence data; introducing Parmulariales ord. nov., and Hemigraphaceae,\nMelaspileellaceae and Stictographaceae fam. nov.","Journal":" Phytotaxa","Volume":" 369","Issue":" 2","Pages":" 063-079","Keywords":" taxonomy, phylogeny, biotrophs, lichenicolous fungi","DOI":"","Abstract":" The family Parmulariaceae comprises three polyphyletic\ngenera, but with very little data in GenBank and is presently placed in\nthe order Asterinales. In this study we re-analyze the available\nsequence data for taxa of the family and re-examine the types of\nHemigrapha, Inocyclus and Parmularia. The phylogenetic tree generated\nfrom maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined LSU-SSU\nsequence data demonstrate the relationships among Hemigrapha, Inocyclus\nand Parmularia species, and the relations of Buelliella, Karschia,\nLabrocarpon, Lembosia, Melaspileella, Melaspileopsis and Stictographa.\nWe introduce Parmulariales ord. nov. to accommodate Parmulariaceae and\nthe order Asterinales accommodates Asterinaceae, Asterotexaceae,\nHemigraphaceae fam. nov., Melaspileellaceae fam. nov. and\nStictographaceae fam. nov. The notes for each new order and the new\nfamilies are provided. We confirm that Asterinaceae sensu lato is\ndistant from Asterinaceae sensu stricto in the phylogenic analysis. The\nclassification presented here is provisional, as more species are needed\nto re-collected and sequenced. We expect further support for our ordinal\nand familial lineages, as well as further novel lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109067","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109067.phy"}]}
