The\nspecies range in age from 17 Ma to modern, representing the earliest\nknown members of the group and its most recent members. Four most\nparsimonious cladograms were discovered,generally agreeing with the\noccurrence of species in the fossil record. Character distributions\nsupport all described species in the context of the phylogenetic species\ndefinition, and important features diagnosing these species are\npresented. The groupâ€™s fossil record and use of its species as\nbiostratigraphic and ecological indicators are discussed. Results of the\ncladograms are also used to detail potential nomenclatural modifications\nof both Thalassiosira itselp and within the plicated Thalassiosira, and\nan outline of this future research is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25648.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25649","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25649.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25650.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25651.phy"}]}
