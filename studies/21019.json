Purpureocorticium and P. microsporum are\ncharacterized by having a resupinate basidiocarp with smooth hymenial\nsurface which turns purple in KOH, and becomes purplish after storage;\nmicroscopically having compact texture of subiculum, nodose-septate\nthin-walled generative hyphae, absence of cystidia, basidia subclavate\nwith a medium constriction, or utriform, bearing ovate-ellipsoid\nsmall-sized basidiospores, which are smooth and thin-walled, inamyloid\nand indextrinoid. Two sets of phylogenetic analyses indicated that\nPurpureocorticium does not belong to all known clades of\nAgaricomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105864.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105863.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105861","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105861.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105859.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105862.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105860","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105860.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105858.phy"}]}
