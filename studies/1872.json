The monotypic genus Gilbertella Hesseltine, which\nis classified into the monogeneric family Gilbertellaceae Benny, appears\nin close phylogenetic relatedness to the Choanephoraceae. The monophyly\nof the Choanephoraceae is supported by aberrantly from low to higher\nranging bootstrap proportions (67 and 98 % in distance and maximum\nparsimony analyses, respectively), whereas the monophyly of the\nChoanephoraceae-Gilbertellaceae clade is supported by high bootstrap\nvalues (98 and 100 %) proposing that both families can be joined into\none family which leads to the elimination of the Gilbertellaceae as a\nseparate family. In order to validate these relationships single-locus\nNeighbor-joining analyses were performed on nuclear genes of the 18S,\n5.8S, 28S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 ribosomal RNA and the\nelongation factor 1 alpha (tef) and beta tubulin (btub) nucleotide\nsequences. The monophyly of the Choanephoraceae-Gilbertellaceae clade\ncould be confirmed in all gene trees. The ultrastructure of sporangia,\nsporangiola and sporangiospores show several morphological characters\n(e.g. longitudinal sutures splitting the sporangial walls, striations\nand polar ciliate appendages on the sporangiospores) which occur only in\nthe Choanephoraceae-Gilbertellaceae clade. Based on these results and\nreanalysis of other morphological and physiological evidences from the\nliterature, we propose to fuse the two families Choanephoraceae and\nGilbertellaceae into one family, the Choanephoraceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1039.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2f","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1040.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1033.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1035.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Choanephoraceae and Gilbertellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1036.phy"}]}
