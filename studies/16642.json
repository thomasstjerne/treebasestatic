Morphological, anatomical and chemical characters and\nmolecular inferences from 3 loci (ITS, nuLSU and mtSSU) strongly support\ntheir assignment to Hypotrachyna (subgenus Longilobae) and\nRemototrachyna. Hypotrachyna producta is further assigned to H. subgenus\nLongilobae and is newly reported for Réunion as well as Remototrachyna\ncostaricensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79504.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79505.phy"}]}
