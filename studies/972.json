The type species\nof Diaporthopsis is D. angelicae, an earlier name for D. nigrella.\nMolecular analysis of the large subunit of the ribosomal nuclear DNA\nplaces D. angelicae within a group that includes the type and many other\nspecies of Diaporthe. In addition, D. angelicae is similar in stromatal,\nperithecial, and centrum morphology to other species of Diaporthe. Based\non morphological and molecular data Diaporthopsis angelicae is\ntransferred to Diaporthe and the genus Diaporthopsis is considered a\nsynonym of Diaporthe. A description and illustrations of D. angelicae\nare presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5777.phy"}]}
