Multiple phylogenetic studies\nhave included taxa of Gloeophyllales, but none have sampled the order\nthoroughly, and so far only ribosomal RNA genes have been used.\nConsequently the limits and higher level placement of the Gloeo-\nphyllales are obscure. We obtained sequence data for three\nprotein-coding genes (rpb2, atp6, tef1) and three rRNA regions (nuc-ssu,\nnuc-lsu, 5.8S) in 19 species of Gloeophyllales representing seven genera\nand analyzed them together with a diverse set of Agaricomycotina,\nemphasizing Polyporales. Boreostereum, which is suspected to produce a\nwhite rot, is the sister group of the rest of the Gloeophyllales, all of\nwhich produce a brown rot. Gloeophyllum contains at least two\nindependent clades, one of which might correspond to the genus\nOsmoporus. White rot and resupinate fruiting bodies appear to be\nplesiomorphic in Gloeophyllales. Relaxed molecular clock analyses\nsuggest that the Gloeophyllales arose in the Cretaceous, after the\norigin of Pinaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT 03","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20678.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 02","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20677.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 01","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20676.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales, Relaxed Clock","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50441.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 5","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50435.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50440.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20691.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 09","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20684.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 05","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20680.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 10","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20685.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 07","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20682.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 08","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20683.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 06","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20681.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 04","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20679.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 11","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20686.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 2","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50432.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 3","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50433.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50431.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 7","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50437.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 9","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50439.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 8","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50438.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 6","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50436.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 4","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50434.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50442.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloeophyllales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50444.phy"}]}
