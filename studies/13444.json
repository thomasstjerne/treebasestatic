We designed and tested primers to\namplify these genes across early-diverging fungal clades, with emphasis\non the Kickxellomycotina, zygomycetous fungi with characteristic flared\nseptal walls forming pores with lenticular plugs. Phylogenetic tree\nresolution and congruence with MCM7 and TSR1 were compared against those\ninferred with nuclear small (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) rRNA genes. We\nalso combined MCM7 and TSR1 data with the rDNA data to create 3- and\n4-gene trees of the Kickxellomycotina, that help to resolve evolutionary\nrelationships among and within the core clades of this subphylum.\nPhylogenies suggest that Orphella, Barbatospora, Spiromyces, and\nRamicandelaber may represent unique lineages. It is suggested that these\nmarkers may be more broadly be useful for phylogenetic studies among\nother groups of early-diverging fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 5 Bayesian 4-Gene tree","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57635","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57635.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 Bayesian MCM7p tree","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57636","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 Bayesian rDNA tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57637","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 Bayesian SSU tree","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57638","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S1 Bayesian MCM7n tree","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57631","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57631.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S1 M-L MCM7n tree","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kickxellomycotina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57622.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2 Bayesian TSR1p tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kickxellomycotina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57639.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3 M-L LSU tree","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57624","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57624.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 M-L 3-Gene tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57625","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57625.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 M-L rDNA tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57628","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57628.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S4 M-L rDNA for TSR1 taxa tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57623","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57623.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S4 Bayesian rDNA for TSR1 taxa tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57632","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57632.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3 Bayesian LSU tree","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57633","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 Bayesian 3-Gene tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57634","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 M-L SSU tree","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57629","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57629.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 M-L MCM7p tree","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57627.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5 M-L 4-Gene tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57626.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2 M-L TSR1p tree","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57630","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57630.phy"}]}
