Colonies on CMD appear distinct, form colorless to white\ncrystals upon isolation, a yellowish to brown pigment, and a\nwhite-spored anamorph exhibiting verticillium-like to gliocladium-like\nstructural elements. ITS1 and 2 sequences exhibit all genus-specific\nfeatures but also contain several unique hallmarks permitting\ndevelopment of a species-diagnostic barcode. Based on the analyses of\npartial rpb2 and tef1 sequences, H. crystalligena\nconstitutes a separate evolutionary lineage with H. megalocitrina\nand H. psychrophila as next neighbors. All these species form one\nphylogenetic clade with the H. pulvinata - H. citrina node.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Hcryst NJ","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea crystalligena sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4604.phy"}]}
