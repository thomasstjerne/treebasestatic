A notable example of\nsymbiosis is that of attine ants (Attini; Formicidae: Hymenoptera) and\ntheir fungal cultivars (Lepiotaceae and Pterulaceae; Agaricales:\nBasidiomycota). In recent years, this mutualism has emerged as a model\nsystem for studying coevolution, speciation, and multitrophic\ninteractions. Ubiquitous in this ant-fungal symbiosis is the “weedy”\nfungus Escovopsis (Hypocreales: Ascomycota), known only as a\nmycoparasite of attine fungal gardens. Despite interest in its biology,\necology and molecular phylogenynoting, especially, the high genetic\ndiversity encounteredwhich has led to a steady flow of publications over\nthe past decade, only two species of Escovopsis have formally been\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished LSU First of 1000 equally MPTs","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65635.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S15 first of 1000 parsimony trees","ntax":"264","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67265","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67265.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S14 NJ with HKY85","ntax":"264","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67264.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S14 parsimony consensus","ntax":"264","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67266","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67266.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S15 NJ with HKY85","ntax":"267","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67267.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S15 parsimony consensus","ntax":"267","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67269.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S15 first of 1000 parsimony trees","ntax":"267","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67268.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65633.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished LSU Maximum likelihood tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished ITS Bayesian tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65636.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65638","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished ITS Maximum likelihood tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Escovopsis ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65637.phy"}]}
