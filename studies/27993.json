Albatrellus alpinus is characterized by\nbuff to pale yellow pileal surface, clamped generative hyphae with\nyellow and shapeless oily substance, and small amyloid basidiospores.\nPhylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS), the large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), indicated\nthat the new species was nested within the genera Albatrellus sensu\nstricto. A key to Chinese species of Albatrellus sensu lato is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albatrellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133594.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albatrellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133596.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albatrellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133595.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albatrellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133597.phy"}]}
