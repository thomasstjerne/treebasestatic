This\nAmerican genus, which included two species from the Caribbean, was\ncircunscribed utilizing morphological and molecular characters; in order\nto analyze both species of the genus, S. amphistemon and S. dura, a\ndetailed study of the micromorphology of the upper anthecium and leaf\nanatomy, together with exomorphological characters, was performed; both\nspecies differ in vegetative and reproductive characters, such as blade\ndistribution, ligules, presence of axillary inflorescences, upper glume\nand lower lemma consistence, lower palea consistence, presence of a\nlower flower, upper anthecium ornamentation, and presence of a rachilla\nextension; regarding the anatomical pattern, S. dura is a C4 PCK\nspecies, while S. amphistemon has C3, non-Kranz leaf anatomy. The\nphylogenetic analysis, based on molecular characters, also support these\nmorphological differences. As a result, we concluded that Scutachne, as\npresently circunscribed, is a polyphyletic genus. Therefore, the genus\nScutachne is here redefined and S. amphistemon is transfered to the new\ngenus. Affinities of the new genus with other genera of Paniceae are\nalso discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML RAxML","ntax":"333","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salariato ndhf Paniceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian BEAST","ntax":"333","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salariato ndhf Paniceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46027.phy"}]}
