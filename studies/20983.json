Location: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Chile and\nNorth America. Methods: Using five mitochondrial and three nuclear gene\nfragments we recovered garli-part maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nphylogenetic hypotheses for 10 of the 11 extant petaltail species.\nBiogeographical patterns were analysed using Lagrange and interpreted\nthrough beast relaxed clock dating analysis. Results: Petaluridae is\nmonophyletic with an origin in the mid-Jurassic, c. 157 Ma. The family\nconsists of two major clades: one with a Laurasian distribution\ncontaining the genera Tachopteryx and Tanypteryx, and another containing\nthe genera Petalura, Phenes and Uropetala, distributed in Gondwanan\nremnants. Based on our beast molecular clock, these two clades separated\nc. 146 Ma. Species ages in Petaluridae range from c. 100 to c. 30\nmillion years, with the majority of the species persisting for 7075\nmillion years. Analysis with Lagrange points to an origin for the family\nassociated with New Zealand, with subsequent dispersal to other\nGondwanan remnants (Australia and Chile) as well as Laurasia (eastern\nand western North America) and subsequent dispersal from western North\nAmerica to Japan. Main conclusions: The extant species of Petaluridae\nare extremely old, with most species persisting as independent lineages\nsince the Jurassic. Our results suggest that New Zealand was close to\nthe origin point in the Jurassic; one possibility is that Antarctica was\nat the centre of the petalurid distribution, based on Permian fossil\nevidence. Such long persistence for species is surprising, especially\nconsidering the specialized habitat required by petalurid larvae; unlike\nthe majority of modern dragonflies, which spend their larval stage in\nponds or streams, petaltails live in fen habitats. Petaltails also take\nmultiple years to develop from egg to adult, another trait uncommon in\nmodern dragonflies. Specialization in a species is normally associated\nwith higher extinction rates; the petaltails appear to be an exception\nto this rule.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1+","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petaluridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107283.phy"}]}
