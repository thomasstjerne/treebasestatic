Based on their morphological and\nphysiological characters and the similarity of their ITS DNA sequences\nwith sequences of isolates at GenBank designated as P. citricola, these\nisolates were routinely identified as P. citricola. In this study DNA\nsequence data from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and\nITS2) and 5.8S gene of the rRNA operon, the mitochondrial coxI and\nβ-tubulin genes were used in combination with morphological and\nphysiological characteristics to characterise these isolates and compare\nthem to the ex-type and the authentic type isolates of P. citricola, and\ntwo other taxa of the P. citricola complex, P. citricola I and the\nrecently described P. multivora. Due to their unique combination of\nmorphological, physiological and molecular characters these\nsemipapillate homothallic isolates are described here as a new species,\nP. plurivora sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS BAYES","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6058.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6474.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT BS","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6475.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6580.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX BS","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6581.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX BAYES","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6683.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BS","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6096.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora citricola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6095.phy"}]}
