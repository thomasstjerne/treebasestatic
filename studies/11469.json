Despite such\nremarkable species diversity and ubiquity, the evolutionary history of\nthis major freshwater fish clade – Otophysi – remains largely\nunexplored. To provide an overview of the history of otophysan\ndiversification, we constructed a timetree based on whole mitogenome\nsequences across 110 species representing 55 of the 64 families.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Best ML of 66 Otophysan and 44 Outgroup species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47638.phy"}]}
