Three lineagesthe Bacillariales, Rhopalodiales, and\nSurirellalespossess a complex and presumably highly derived raphe that\nis physically separated from the cell interior, most often by a set of\nsiliceous braces. Because the relationship among these three lineages is\nunclear, the number of origins of the canal raphe system and the\nhomology of it and its constitutive parts among these lineages, is\nequally unclear. We reconstructed the phylogeny of raphid pennate\ndiatoms and included, for the first time, members of all three canal\nraphid diatom lineages, and used the phylogeny to test specific\nhypotheses about the origin of the canal raphe. The canal raphe appears\nto have evolved twice, once in the common ancestor of Bacillariales and\nonce in the common ancestor of Rhopalodiales and Surirellales, which\nform a monophyletic group in our analyses. These results recommend\ncareful follow-up morphogenesis studies of the canal raphe in these two\nlineages to determine the underlying developmental basis for this\nremarkable case of parallel evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatom Canal Raphe System","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27573.phy"}]}
