Because of their blunt and largely undifferentiated\nmacromorphology, their microscopic features, especially the spore shape,\nsize, colour and number of septa, together with the morphology of the\nparaphyses, are critical in the discrimination of the species. Even\nthough it has been hypothesized that several species could be associated\nwith various plants and mosses (Nitare, 1982; Bergemann &\nGarbelotto, 2006; Ohenoja et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011), the ecology\nof Geoglossum and related genera remains insufficiently understood and,\nso far, no clear correlations between the various species and potential\nhosts have been conclusively established (Hustad et al., 2013). A number\nof taxonomic and monographic studies over the years have mainly focused\non American and Northern or Central European collections (Durand, 1908,\n1921; Mains, 1940, 1954, 1955; Imai, 1940; Nannfeldt, 1942; Hakelier,\n1967; Nitare, 1983, 1984, 1988; Læssøe & Elborne, 1984; Olsen, 1986;\nHallgrimsson, 1987; Schoch et al., 2009; Kučera & Gaisler, 2012;\nHustad et al., 2013). By contrast, the genus had been, until recently,\npoorly documented in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Priou,\n1992).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geoglossaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85680.phy"}]}
