Three infrageneric classifications have been proposed in the last\n110 years, all of them based on morphological characters and none of\nwhich have been tested with molecular data. In the present study, xxx\nnuclear and xxx chloroplast sequences from 50 species were analyzed in\norder to test the infrageneric classifications proposed for Prestonia,\nincluding representatives of all the sections ever proposed, as well to\nconfirm the monophyly of the genus with a larger sample compared to\nprevious studies. Prestonia was shown to be monophyletic, but all the\ninfrageneric sections proposed by Schumann, Woodson and Pichon are\nnon-monophyletic. Based on our results, we proposed a new infrageneric\nclassification for Prestonia, recognizing seven sections: Annulares,\nCoalita, Denticulata, Exserta, Molles, Prestonia. Prestonia pickelii\nMarkgr. is recognized again as an accepted species and removed from the\nsynonymy of P. quinquangularis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98830","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98834","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98837.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98832.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98835","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98835.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98836","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98836.phy"}]}
