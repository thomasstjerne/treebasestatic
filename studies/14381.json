During\nthe course of a species-level revision of UK waxcap (Hygrophoraceae)\ndiversity, two previously unrecognized species were discovered. We\ndescribe Gliophorus europerplexus sp. nov. and G. reginae sp. nov.,\nrespectively orangebrown and purplepink waxcap mushrooms, from\nnutrient-poor grasslands in Britain. Both share some morphological\nfeatures with specimens assigned to Gliophorus (=Hygrocybe) psittacinus.\nHowever, analysis of sequences of the nuclear ITS DNA barcode region\nfrom these and related taxa confirmed the phylogenetic distinctness of\nthese lineages. Furthermore, it revealed that the holotype of\nHygrophorus perplexus, a North American species morphologically\nresembling G. europerplexus, was phylogenetically divergent from all our\ncollections. It is likely that further collections of G. europerplexus\nwill be revealed by sequencing European material currently filed under\nG. perplexus, Hygrophorus perplexus, Hygrocybe perplexa and H.\npsittacina var. perplexa. However, two such collections in K yielded\nsequences that clustered together but were divergent from those of G.\neuroperplexus, G. perplexus and G. psittacinus. By contrast, G. reginae\nis morphologically distinct and can usually be recognized in the field\nby its purplish viscid pileus and relatively stout, flexuose, pale\nstipe. It is named to commemorate the diamond jubilee of Her Majesty\nQueen Elizabeth II in 2012 and the 60th anniversary of her coronation in\n2013.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64382.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64381.phy"}]}
