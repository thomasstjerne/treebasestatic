Phylogenetic analysis with\nmaximum likelihood (ML) using IQtree v1.4.1 of combined data (Histone H3\nand 28S rDNA) reveals that the new genus Vittaliana belongs to a clade\nconsisting of Opsius versicolor (Distant, 1908), Opsiini gen. sp.,\nLibengaia sp., Hishimonus phycitis (Distant, 1908) and Yinfomibus\nmenglaensis Du, Liang & Dai (2019) with good branch support, and\nthat the tribe Opsiini is paraphyletic. This resolves the placement of a\nnew genus in the tribe Opsiini under Deltocephalinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum-likelihood (ML) tree estimated from the\ncombined dataset (Histone H3, 28S rDNA)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125011.phy"}]}
