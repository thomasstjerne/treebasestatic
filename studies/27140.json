Hyphoderma\npuerense is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate\nbasidiomata with smooth to flocculent hymenial surface, a monomitic\nhyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamped connections, IKI,\nCB and ellipsoid, colorless, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores measuring\nas 67.5 × 34.5 µm. Hyphoderma tenuissimum is characterized by resupinate\nbasidiomata with tuberculate to mini-grandinoid hymenial surface, a\nmonomitic hyphal system, presence of septate cystidia and cylindrical to\nallantoid, colorless, thin-walled, smooth basidiospores. Sequences of\nITS+nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated and\nphylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum\nparsimony and Bayesian inference methods. These phylogenetic analyses\nbased on molecular data of ITS+nLSU sequences showed that two new\nspecies clustered into Hyphoderma, in which H. puerense grouped with H.\nmoniliforme, and H. tenuissimum was sister to H. mopanshanense.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129695.phy"}]}
