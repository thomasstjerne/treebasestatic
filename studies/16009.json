In the R. maritima\ncomplex, while multiple hybrid speciation through allopolyploidy and\nrepeated hybridizations followed by a chloroplast capture contributed\nthe diversity in a mostly polyploidy lineage, a mode of speciation in a\ndiploid lineage has not yet been intensively discussed. Here we test a\nhypothesis of ecological differentiation in relation with Pleistocene\nglobal cooling to explain morphologically and ecologically diverged\nsister taxa in the diploid lineage. The analysis revealed that the most\nrecent common ancestor of the two taxa was evolved in inland North\nAmerica from a related coastal taxon in Miocene. The evolution was\nfollowed by a speciation in Pleistocene, indicating that the significant\nmorphological and ecological differences were established between the\ntwo taxa in the last 1.5 Mya. By contrast, the sister coastal taxon\nexpanded its distribution from North America to Eurasia and Pacific in\nthe last 2.8 Mya and still no such differences were known among the\nregions, strongly indicating that the speciation between the two taxa is\nexplained by the accelerated rate at which ecological differentiation\nevolves in the Pleistocene glaciations, perhaps because of stronger\ndivergent selection resulting from greater ecological opportunities in\ndepauperate boreal habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75759.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75767.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75766.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75764.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75768.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75760.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75761.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75762.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75763.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75765.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75769.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ruppia ptDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75770.phy"}]}
