The\nresults of phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear ITS and chloroplast\ntrnLtrnF data support C. aureliana as a clearly distinct taxon within\nthe Campanula ser. Gagranicae Trinajstić. Its description is given and\ndiagnostic morphological and SEM seed micromorphological characters of\nclosely related species are compared and discussed. Morphologically C.\naureliana shows close relation with C. fenestrellata Feer, mainly for\nthe habit, shape and size of the corolla, but differs in a lot of\nsignificant features. Information on its ecology and conservation status\nof newly described taxa is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78581","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78581.phy"}]}
