Three distinct conidial morphologies were found. In one\ntype the conidia become brown before they are discharged from the\npycnidia and remain aseptate. In the second morphological type conidia\nare initially hyaline and aseptate and only after they are released from\nthe pycnidia do they develop a septum and become coloured dark brown.\nConidia of the third group are initially hyaline and aseptate, but only\nrarely do they develop a septum and become pale brown. The phylogenetic\nanalyses resolved three main clades each one coinciding with three\ndistinct morphologies of the asexual morphs. Two of the clades were\nwell-supported by high bootstrap values in ML and MP while the third was\nweakly supported. This third clade consisted of a well-supported\nsub-clade comprising typical Diplodia species as typified by D. mutila\nand another comprising D. bulgarica, D. cupressi and D. tsugae, which\nare somewhat atypical of this genus. It was concluded that what was\npreviously regarded as Diplodia comprises three distinct morphological\nand phylogenetic genera and two new genera are introduced here, namely\nHaplodia and Pidlodia. The status of D. bulgarica, D. cupressi and D.\ntsugae remains uncertain, but for the time being they are retained\nwithin Diplodia until more species can be studied and their phylogenetic\nposition established.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124968.phy"}]}
