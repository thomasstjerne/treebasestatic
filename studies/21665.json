Two strains of the species displayed typical\ncharacteristics of the genus Citeromyces. Gene sequences D1/D2 domains\nof large subunit (LSU) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) including\n5.8S rDNA, mitochondrial small-subunit rRNA gene (MtSm), and translation\nelongation factor-1α (EF-1α) showed that the strains were separated from\nthe other four existing species of the genus Citeromyces. Therefore, the\ntwo strains were proposed to be represented a novel species within the\ngenus Citeromyces, Citeromyces cibodasensis ; the type strain is NBRC\n110244T (=InaCCY703T= AK01).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Citeromyces cibodasensis sp. nov neighbor-joining","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110329.phy"}]}
