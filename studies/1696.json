Seven\nspecimens of two of the three recognized species were sampled to infer\nthe phylogenetic relationships of this lineage to other polygrammoid\nferns and the diversity within this lineage. All approaches found\nSynammia clearly separated from other polygrammoid ferns, but the exact\nrelationships are still unclear. Model-based methods recovered Synammia\nas sister to a mainly neotropical clade of polygrammoid ferns, but\nsupport for this hypothesis was provided only by Bayesian inference of\nphylogeny. The deletion of nearly the whole rps4-trnS IGS is a\nsynapomorphy of Synammia. The lineage is separated from other extant\npolygrammoid ferns, but very low to zero sequence diversity was found\namong the seven samples of Synammia. The results strongly support an\nindependent lineage of polygrammoid ferns in southern South\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygrammoid Ferns, MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polygrammoid Ferns, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2303.phy"}]}
