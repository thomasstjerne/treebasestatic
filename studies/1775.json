Previously, we\nidentified ancient allelic variation at het-c in pseudohomothallic N.\ntetrasperma, which confirmed outcrossing in this species. Here, we\nreport distinct ancestral alleles at het-6 and un-24, two closely linked\ngenes with het incompatibility function in N. crassa. The pattern of\nvariation at het-6 and un-24 in N. tetrasperma is similar to that\nobserved for N. crassa, where two ancestral allele specificities exist\nfor each locus, Oak Ridge (het-6OR, un-24OR) and Panama (het-6PA,\nun-24PA). Only het-6OR/un-24OR and het-6PA/un-24PA allele combinations\nhave been observed. The absence of recombinant haplotypes (e.g.,\nhet-6OR/un-24PA) appears to derive from an ancestral chromosomal\nrearrangement that limits recombination. Allelic variation at this het\nlocus in N. tetrasperma provides further evidence of outcrossing in this\npredominantly selfing organism and indicates that selection maintains\nallelic diversity at het loci.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Linkage disequilbrium in pseudohomothallic Neurospora\ntetrasperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2718.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Linkage disequilbrium in pseudohomothallic Neurospora\ntetrasperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2719.phy"}]}
