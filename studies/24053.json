It was found on Andosol soil along a road\nbank at elevation from 1,200 to 1,900 m in Nagano and Yamanashi\nPrefectures, central Japan. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of\nJapanese samples based on the nrLSU sequence showed that L. meridionalis\nwas genetically distinct from L. grisella and L. oreades. Lichenomphalia\nmeridionalis has been known exclusively from Mediterranean countries,\nbut our finding showed that L. meridionalis could be widely distributed\nthan previously thought.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coccomyxa ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121727.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichenomphalia ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121730.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichenomphalia LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121729.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lichenomphalia ITS1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121728.phy"}]}
