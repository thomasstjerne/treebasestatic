The all six isolates\nshowed similar morphology each other, and had complexly branched\nsecondary hyphae, globose non-proliferating sporangia and smooth surface\noogonia which have one or two oospores per oogonium. The combination of\nthese characteristics differentiated these isolates from the other known\nspecies of Pythium. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the\nD1/D2 region of the large subunit ribosomal DNA showed that the all\nPythium isolates were clustered in a single clade which distantly\nrelated from other known clades of the genus. We described these\nisolates as a new Pythium species, Pythium apinafurcum, based on\nmorphology and molecular phylogeny. The P. apinafurcum isolates infected\nnon-symptomatically the roots of seedlings of bermudagrass, cabbage and\ncucumber in a pot inoculation test.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6389.phy"}]}
