Microscopic examinations of the chasmothecia suggested a\nspecies belonging to Erysiphe sect. Erysiphe, above all due to mycelioid\nchasmothecial appendages, although circinate apices of the appendages\nwere rather in favor of Erysiphe sect. Uncinula, which is a fairly rare\ncombinations of appendage characteristics in Erysiphe. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of ITS and 28S rDNA sequences demonstrated that the two\nexamined powdery mildew collections on D. parviflora clustered together\nas an independent lineage within Erysiphe with 100% bootstrap support,\nrepresenting a species of its own, which is phylogenetically allied to\nbut clearly distinct from Erysiphe deutziae and, in addition,\nmorphologically quite different from all known Erysiphe species on hosts\nbelonging to the Hydrangeaceae. The new species on D. parviflora is\ndescribed as Erysiphe deutziicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe deutziicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117992.phy"}]}
