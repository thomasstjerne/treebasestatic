Dentipellis\nlongiuscula is characterized by annual, resupinate hydnoid basidiomata\nwith moderately long spines, rough basidiospores (56 × 33.6 µm) and\nabsence of gloeoplerous and gloeocystidia. Dentipellis tropicalis is\ncharacterized by hydnoid basidiomata with numerous gloeocystidia\npresenting in hymenium, and minutely rough basidiospores (55.5 × 2.53.2\nµm). Phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) and nuclear large subunit ribosomal (nLSU) RNA gene regions\nconfirmed the affinity of the new species in Dentipellis and indicated\ntheir relationships with other species in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102689","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102689.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102690.phy"}]}
