Here we\ndescribe new material of “Rossella” nodastrella from cold-water coral\nreefs in the NW Atlantic (Florida). Morphological comparison with the\nholotype from the Azores and specimens recently reported from off\nIreland reveal at least two distinct species, which we corroborate with\nmolecular data. Because the diphyletic nature of “Rossella” is further\nsupported with inclusion of the new specimens in the molecular\nphylogeny, we erect a new genus, Nodastrella gen. nov., for these two\nspecies. The Irish specimens are synonymized with our new species\nNodastrella asconemaoida sp. nov. Subtle morphological and molecular\ndifferences between the E and W Atlantic specimens are for the time\nbeing ascribed to intraspecific geographic variation, but indicate that\nNodastrella might contain more (sub)species, pending investigation of\nadditional specimens, especially from intermediate locations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rossellidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53149.phy"}]}
