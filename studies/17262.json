Hakusan in Japan for more than 20 years. Among\nagaric fungi found in the alpine dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) forests,\ndominant, large, stout, red Russula species were temporarily named\nHakusan-akane-hatsu (HAH) in Japanese, and 11 samples were deposited in\nthe National Museum of Nature and Science. To clarify whether HAH is a\nknown species of Russula and also whether HAH is a single species, DNAs\nof the HAHs deposited in the Herbarium, together with HAHs newly\ncollected since 2009 were sequenced and the microscopic features of the\nfungi were examined. From the paraformaldehyde-fumigated samples\ndeposited in the Herbarium, short sequences of the ITS2 region were\namplified and sequenced, and the ITS1 to ITS2 region was also sequenced\nas a universal DNA barcode marker. Many of the samples showed identical\nsequences with R. paludosa reported from the northern part of Europe,\nand others were identified as R. xerampelina, R. decolorans and unknown\nspecies of Russula. This is the first record in Japan of R. paludosa\n(the main species of HAH). The finding of identical sequences of R.\npaludosa in northern Europe and Japan suggests a relatively recent\nmigration southward to Japan, possibly during the last glacial\nperiod.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Russula paludosa in alpine dwarf pine ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86134.phy"}]}
