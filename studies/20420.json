The main goal of this study was to use\nmolecular data to clarify the relationships of P. chrysolepis inside the\npolygrammoid clade. Sequences from three plastid regions (cpDNA - rbcL,\nrps4 and rps4Â–trnS IGS) from fifty species belonging to thirty-two genera\nof Polypodiaceae were analyzed using maximum likelihood and bayesian\ninference. Polypodium chrysolepis constitutes an isolated lineage among\nthe neotropical polygrammoid ferns, close to Serpocaulon and the\ngrammitids, and is recognized here in a new genus. It can be\ndistinguished by its entire leaves with free veins and peltate,\npedicellate, lanceolate paraphyses. A new combination and a complete\ntaxonomic treatment are presented, and conservation status was assessed\nusing IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adetogramma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125874.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adetogramma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125875.phy"}]}
