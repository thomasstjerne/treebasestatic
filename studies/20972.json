This combination of molecular\nand phylogenetic sampling is used to reconstruct the cosmopolitan\nradiation of lobeliads, with special focus on the origin of the giant\nlobelias.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BestTree","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103996","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103996.phy"}]}
