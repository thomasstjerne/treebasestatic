As a consequence,\nthese three genera have been removed from the Woodsiaceae and placed in\ntheir own family, the Cystopteridaceae. Despite the ubiquity of the\nfamily in rocky habitats across the northern hemisphere, and its\ncosmopolitan distribution (occurring on every continent except\nAntarctica), sampling of the Cystopteridaceae in phylogenetic studies to\ndate has been sparse. Here we assemble a three-locus plastid dataset\n(matK, rbcL, trnG-R) that includes most of the recognized species in the\nfamily and multiple accessions of widespread taxa from across their\ngeographic ranges. All three sampled genera are strongly supported as\nmonophyletic, Cystopteris is strongly supported as sister to\nAcystopteris, and those two genera together are sister to Gymnocarpium.\nThe Gymnocarpium phylogeny is marked by a deep divisions two three major\nclades, which we label the disjunctum clade, the robertianum clade, and\ncore Gymnocarpium. The Cystopteris phylogeny, similarly, features four\ndeeply diverged clades: C. montana, the sudetica clade, the bulbifera\nclade, and the fragilis complex. Acystopteris includes only three\nspecies, each of which is supported as monophyletic, with A. taiwaniana\nsister to the clade of the other two. Our results yield the first\nspecies-level phylogeny within the genera and the first molecular\nphylogenetic evidence for species boundaries. These data provide an\nessential foundation for further investigations of complex patterns of\ngeographic diversification, speciation, and reticulation in this\nclade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootrep9","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57687","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57687.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep11","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57689","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57689.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep28","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57706","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57706.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep8","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57655.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep21","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57668.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57648.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP13","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57709","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57709.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep4","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57682","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57682.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep5","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57683","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57683.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep6","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57684.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep8","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57686","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57686.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep12","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57690.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep13","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57691.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep14","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57692.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep15","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57693","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57693.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep16","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57694","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57694.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep17","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57695","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57695.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep18","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57696","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57696.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep19","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57697","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57697.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep20","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57698","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57698.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep21","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57699.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep23","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57701","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57701.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep24","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57702","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57702.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep25","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57703","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57703.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep26","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57704","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57704.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep27","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57705","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57705.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep29","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57707","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57707.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep100","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57708","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57708.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP8","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57647","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57647.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep2","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57649","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57649.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep3","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57650","tree_kind":"NA","tr
