They are resolved within a clade of\nLastreopsis, Megalastrum and Rumohra, with strong support. Lastreopsis\nis recovered as polyphyletic, and the two Australia genera are nested in\none of the polyphyletic groups. Compared to the related genera,\nCoveniella exhibits unique morphology through its once-pinnate fronds.\nOn the other hand, Oenotrichia is distinguished via several characters\nincluding the position of the sori, frond indument, and scales. In order\nto resolve the taxonomy of Australian Oenotrichia, which are clearly\nseparate from Oenotrichia s.s. in the Dennstaedtiaceae, a new generic\nname is proposed, Dantela Nagalingum gen. nov. The new genus is endemic\nto Australia and is restricted to the northeastern Queensland\nregion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLconsensus","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71678","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71678.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLbipartitions","ntax":"146","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71679","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71679.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLbipartitions","ntax":"447","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71677","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71677.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLconsensus","ntax":"447","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71676","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71676.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLconsensus","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71680","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71680.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLbipartitions","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr71681","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_71681.phy"}]}
