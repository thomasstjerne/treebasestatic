Dentary and maxillary characters\npreviously considered as autapomorphies of K. kohlerorum and P.\nisonensis, respectively, are shown to be synapomorphies uniting the\nlatter with Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus from the Campanian of the Wangshi\nGroup, Shandong Province, China. This study provided conclusive evidence\nof the presence of the Lambeosaurinae in Europe. Tsintaosaurus\nspinorhinus and Pararhabdodon isonensis were inferred to form a clade of\nbasal lambeosaurines characterized by a maxilla with an elevated\narticular facet for the jugal (continuous with the ectopterygoid ridge)\nand an extremely medially projected symphyseal region of the dentary.\nThis clade originated in Asia during the middle or late Campanian.\nPararhabdodon isonensis or its ancestors migrated from Asia to the\nIberian island of the European archipelago. Reconstruction of ancestral\nareas by Fitch parsimony attributes the European occurrence of P.\nisonensis to a single dispersal event from Asia no later than middle to\nlate Campanian.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosauroidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55988.phy"}]}
