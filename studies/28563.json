Morphological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that\npowdery mildew fungi on A. esculentus was Golovinomyces ambrosiae. A\nmultilocus phylogenetic examination with ITS, 28S rDNAï¼ŒIGS, and chsI\nsequence data was carried out to confirm that G. spadiceus should be\nallocated to G. ambrosiae with sequences data Malvaceae specimen.\nAnalyses of sequences from ITS determined there were G. ambrosiae and G.\nbolayi within Golovinomyces were attacked okra, rather than involved\nwith G. cichoracearum, G. orontii in a sensu lato, and G.\nspadiceus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132434","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132434.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_12","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132433","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132433.phy"}]}
