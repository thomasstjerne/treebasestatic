A phylogenetic study to investigate the putative\nmonophyly of the tribe and the intergeneric relationships is presented\nhere. Nucleotide sequences of the plastid gene rbcL, trnL intron and\ntrnL-trnF intergenic spacer were analyzed from 114 Annonaceae taxa,\nincluding 24 Miliuseae species and two outgroups using maximum parsimony\nand Bayesian inference. The two data sets (rbcL and the trnL-trnF\nregions) were analyzed separately and in combination. Miliuseae were\nfound to be polyphyletic due to the position of Mezzettia and are part\nof a large, predominantly Asian and Central-American clade (miliusoid\nclade). Although intergeneric relationships were poorly resolved, all\ngenera, except Polyalthia, were monophyletic, supporting previous\ngeneric delimitation based on morphology. A group of three Polyalthia\nspecies seems the most likely sister group of Miliusa. Several\ninfrageneric groups of Miliusa, Orophea, and Polyalthia are supported by\nboth molecular and morphological data. No morphological synapomorphies\nhave yet been found for the miliusoid clade. Molecular clades within the\nmiliusoid clade, however, can be characterized by size and the shape of\nthe outer petals, number of ovules per carpel, and the size of the\nfruits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Annonaceae rbcL, trnL-F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1751.phy"}]}
