Reefs are\nstructurally complex, highly productive shallow-water marine ecosystems\nfound in tropical (coral reefs) and temperate zones (rocky reefs) which\nharbor exceptional-levels of biodiversity. We investigated whether reef\nhabitats promote the evolution of morphological diversity in the feeding\nand locomotion systems of grunts (Haemulidae), a group of predominantly\nnocturnal fishes that live on both temperate and tropical reefs. Using\nphylogenetic comparative methods and statistical analyses that take into\naccount uncertainty in phylogeny and the evolutionary history of\nreef-living we demonstrate that rates of morphological evolution are\nfaster in reef-dwelling haemulids. The magnitude of this effect depends\non the type of trait; on average, traits involved in the functional\nsystems for prey capture and processing evolve twice as fast on reefs as\nlocomotor traits. This result, along with the observation that haemulids\ndo not exploit unique feeding niches on reefs, suggests that fine-scale\ntrophic niche partitioning and character displacement may be driving\nhigher rates of morphological evolution. Whatever the cause, there is\ngrowing evidence that reef habitats stimulate morphological and\nfunctional diversification in teleost fishes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52358","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52358.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52359","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52359.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52360","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52360.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52361","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52361.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52362","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52362.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52363","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52363.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52364","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52364.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52365","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52365.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52366","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52366.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52367","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52367.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52368","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52368.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52369.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52370.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52371.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52372","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52372.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52373","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52373.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52374","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52374.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52375","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52375.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52376","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52376.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52377","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52377.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52378.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52379.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52380.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52381.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52382.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52383.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52384.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52385.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52386.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52387.phy"}]}
