While mtDNA often differs substantially between species, large\ndifferences may also be found within species. The evaluation of such\ndivergent lineages, for example in intraspecific contact zones (hybrid\nzones), commonly involves sequencing numerous individuals. Large-scale\nsequencing is both expensive and labour-intensive. Based on sequences\nfrom 15 individuals, we devised a simple and quick PCR-assay for\nidentification of divergent mtDNA lineages in a secondary contact zone\nof the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The application uses\nlineage-selective primers to amplify a lineage diagnostic product, and\nis based on each group of mtDNA haplotypes being a monophyletic\nassemblage of haplotypes sharing the same maternal ancestry, deeply\ndivergent from the other group. The assay was tested on a larger sample\n(n=147) of specimens from the contact zone, confirming its usefulness in\nquick and reliable identification of mtDNA lineages. This approach can\nbe modified for other species, provided diagnostic lineage variation is\navailable, and may also be performed in simple laboratory settings while\nconducting fieldwork.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Genealogy of mitochondrial lineages in Uta stansburiana\nfor MAMA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2806.phy"}]}
