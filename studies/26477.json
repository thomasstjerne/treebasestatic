During a survey of fungi associated\nwith ambrosia beetles in Florida, USA, an undescribed Esteya species was\nfound. A phylogenetic analysis based on LSU and β-tubulin DNA sequences\nsupported this isolate as a new species, Esteya floridanum Y. Li, Araújo\n& Hulcr. Morphological and phylogenetic characteristics and a\nspecies description are provided here. The fungus was observed to kill\nthe pine wood nematode in vitro. To evaluate its ability to protect\ntrees against the pine wood nematode in vivo, the effect of prophylactic\ninoculation was tested on Pinus koraiensis and Larix olgensis in\nLiaoning, China. The results suggest that the fungus is not a plant\npathogen and that it delays the wilt and postpones death of two conifer\ntrees. This presents a potential new avenue for research on biocontrol\nof the pine wilt disease, and stresses the value of research on pest\norganisms in their native regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125097","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125097.phy"}]}
