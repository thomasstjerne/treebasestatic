In addition to new\nspecies, eight known species of Diaporthe, D. eres, D. foeniculina, D.\ngulyae, D. novem, D. ravennica, D. rhusicola, D. rudis and D. sterilis\nwere identified. Phylogenetic relationships of the new species with\nother Diaporthe species are revealed by DNA sequence analyses based on\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha (TEF), partial regions of the β-tubulin (BT) and\ncalmodulin (CAL). Among 44 isolates, D. eres is the dominant species,\naccounting for 27.3% of the frequency of occurrence. Our study revealed\na high diversity of undescribed Diaporthe species from various hosts in\nItaly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe species from Italy","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107088.phy"}]}
