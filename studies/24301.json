The pathogen occurs mostly in the\nNorthern Hemisphere but has also been reported in Central America and\nColombia. BSNB can lead to stunted growth and tree mortality and has\nresulted in severe damage to pine plantations in the past. There have\nbeen increasingly frequent new reports of this pathogen in Europe and in\nNorth America during the course of the past 10 years. This is despite\nthe fact that quarantine practices and eradication protocols are in\nplace to prevent its spread. Taxonomy: Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota;\nSubphylum Pezizomycotina; Class Dothideomycetes; Subclass\nDothideomycetidae; Order Capniodales; Family Mycosphaerellaceae; Genus\nLecanosticta. Host range and distribution: Lecanosticta spp. occur on\nvarious Pinus species and are found in North America, Central America,\nSouth America (Colombia), Europe as well as Asia. Disease symptoms:\nSmall yellow irregular spots appear on the infected pine needles that\nbecome brown over time. They can be surrounded by a yellow halo. These\ncharacteristic brown spots develop to form narrow brown bands that\nresult in needle death from the tips down to the point of infection.\nNeedles are prematurely shed, leaving bare branches with tufts of new\nneedles at the branch tips. Infection is usually most severe in the\nlower parts of the trees and progresses upwards into the canopies.\nUseful websites: The EPPO global database providing information on L.\nacicola
