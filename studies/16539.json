In the present study, we\ninvestigated 91 Pestalotiopsis isolates from the CBS-KNAW Fungal\nBiodiversity Centre (CBS) culture collection. The phylogeny of the\nAmphisphaeriaceae was constructed based on analysis of 28S nrRNA gene\n(LSU) sequence data, and taxonomic changes are proposed to reflect more\nnatural groupings. We combined morphological and DNA data, and\nsegregated two novel genera from Pestalotiopsis, namely\nNeopestalotiopsis and Pseudopestalotiopsis. The three genera are easily\ndistinguishable on the basis of their conidiogenous cells and colour of\ntheir median conidial cells. We coupled morphological and combined\nsequence data of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), partial Î²-tubulin\n(TUB) and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) gene\nregions, which revealed 30 clades in Neopestalotiopsis and 43 clades in\nPestalotiopsis. Based on these data, 11 new species are introduced in\nNeopestalotiopsis, 24 in Pestalotiopsis, and two in\nPseudopestalotiopsis. Several new combinations are proposed to emend\nmonophyly of Neopestalotiopsis, Pestalotiopsis and\nPseudopestalotiopsis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopestalotiopsis and Pseudopestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78564.phy"}]}
