This genus split from other powdery mildew genera at an\nearly stage of evolution, and thus has been considered as one of the\nmost ancestral genera in the Erysiphales. Phylogenetic analyses using\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 28S rRNA gene\nsequences indicated that one of the species, P. septata, is divided into\nthree distinct genotypes. The ITS sequence similarities between the\nthree genotypes were 96% or less, suggesting species level differences\namong the genotypes. Combined with detailed morphological observations,\nP. septata s. lat. is divided into three species, viz. P. septata s.\nstr., P. polyspora, and P. uncinata. These species are clearly defined\nby morphological characteristics such as the number of ascospores per\nascus and morphology of appendages, as well as DNA sequences. A key to\nthe species of Parauncinula is also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parauncinula ITS+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102755.phy"}]}
