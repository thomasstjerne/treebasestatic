Badnaviruses (family Caulimoviridae) are considered one of the\nmost prevalent viruses infecting yam plants. Recently, it has been shown\nthat endogenous Dioscorea bacilliform virus (eDBV) sequences are present\nin the yam genome. In Brazil, only Dioscorea bacilliform AL virus has\nbeen found infecting yam. Foliar samples of yam were obtained in 2014\nfrom a Brazilian germplasm collection. Total DNA was extracted from\nsymptomatic leaf of the DGC-379 sample, and used as a template for PCR\namplification using degenerate primer set designed based on RT/RNaseH\ncoding sequences of members of the genus Badnavirus. Amplicon of the\nexpected size was commercially sequenced. In the present study,\nDioscorea bacilliform SN virus is reported for the first time in yam in\nBrazil and in the worldwide host Dioscorea bulbifera. These results\nincrease concern about safe germplasm exchange among yam breeding\nprograms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89167","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89167.phy"}]}
