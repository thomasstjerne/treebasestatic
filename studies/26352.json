Given different taxonomic\ninterpretations and proposals for generic and specific relationships, a\nrepresentative phylogenetic analysis is required to clarify the\nsystematics of this group. The present study provides a framework for\nunderstanding phylogenetic relationships and contributing to the\ndevelopment of an appropriate taxonomic treatment of Gilliesieae.\nMolecular analyses, based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid DNA sequences\n(trnL-F spacer and rbcL gene), resolve with strong support the monophyly\nof the tribe and the differentiation of two major clades. Clade I\ncomprises the genera Gilliesia, Gethyum, and Solaria and Clade II\ninclude Miersia and Speea. These well-supported clades are mostly\ncongruent with vegetative and karyotype characters rather than,\ne.g. floral symmetry. At the generic level, all molecular analyses\nreveal the paraphyly of Gilliesia and Miersia. Gethyum was found to be\nparaphyletic, resulting in the confirmation of Ancrumia as a distinct\ngenus. Several instances of incongruent phylogenetic signals were found\namong data sets. The calibrated tree suggests a recent diversification\nof the tribe (PliocenePleistocene), a contemporary process of speciation\nin which instances of hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting could\nexplain patterns of paraphyly and incongruence of floral\nmorphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS MCC Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gilliesieae ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123873.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS + Indels MCC Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123871","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123871.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA + indels MCC Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123875","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123875.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA + indels Consensus Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123874","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123874.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA Consensus Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123876","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123876.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Consensus Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123872","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123872.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS + Indels Consensus Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gilliesieae ITS + indels","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123870.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA MCC Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gilliesieae rbcL + trnL-F","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123877.phy"}]}
