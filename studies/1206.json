Our study makes use of DNA\nsequences from two mitochondrial and two nuclear genes, and we use\nmodel-based methods of phylogenetic analysis to infer relationships and\ndetermine the level of support for each proposed relationship.\nRelationships among geomyine pocket gopher genera remain only partially\nresolved despite a number of earlier attempts to reconstruct their\nphylogenetic history and despite the newly generated sequence data\nanalyzed in this study. This lack of resolution does not appear to\nresult from insufficient or inappropriate DNA data, nor is it caused by\ninadequate sampling of taxa. Rather, molecular data and fossil data\ntogether lead to the conclusion that diversification within the Geomyini\nlikely occurred during a geologically brief period in the Blancan. Rapid\nclimate change during the Blancan, the origin of patchily distributed\ngrasslands, and the evolution of hypsodonty may have triggered the rapid\ndiversification that eventually produced the five extant genera of the\nGeomyini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pocket gophers, RY tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pocket gophers, GATC tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1848.phy"}]}
