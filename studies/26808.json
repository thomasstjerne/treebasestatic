Phylogenetic\nanalyses using a matrix composed of an internal transcribed spacer,\ntef1-α, tub2, and rpb2 sequences revealed that the examined\nLasiodiplodia isolates were divided into eleven clades, which\ncorresponds to L. theobromae, L. brasiliensis, L. swieteniae, L.\npseudotheobromae, and Lasiodiplodia spp. These Lasiodiplodia species\nwere also identified based on their morphological characteristics and\nthe optimum growth temperature of each isolate. Moreover, four of the\nLasiodiplodia isolates were newly added to the Japanese mycoflora, while\nfour other speciesL. latispora, L. parvispora, L. ryukyuensis and L.\nyaguchii were proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia its+tef+tub2+rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125404.phy"}]}
