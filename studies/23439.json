During the last decade, molecular‐based approaches have\nadvanced the field by providing additional sources of evidence to\nclassical, morphology‐based taxonomy. However, taxonomy has not yet\nfully embraced molecular species delimitation beyond threshold‐based,\nsingle‐gene approaches, and taxonomic knowledge is not commonly\nintegrated into multilocus species delimitation models. Here we aim to\nbridge empirical data (taxonomic and genetic) with recently developed\ncoalescent‐based species delimitation approaches. We use the\nmultispecies coalescent model as implemented in two Bayesian methods\n(dissect/stacey and bp&p) to infer species hypotheses. In both\ncases, we account for phylogenetic uncertainty (by not using any guide\ntree) and taxonomic uncertainty (by measuring the impact of using a\npriori taxonomic assignments to specimens). We focus on an entire\nNeotropical tribe of butterflies, the Haeterini (Nymphalidae:\nSatyrinae). We contrast divergent taxonomic opinion  splitting, lumping\nand misclassifying species  in the light of different phenotypic\nclassifications proposed to date. Our results provide a solid background\nfor the recognition of 22 species. The synergistic approach presented\nhere overcomes limitations in both traditional taxonomy (e.g. by\nrecognizing cryptic species) and molecular‐based methods (e.g. by\nrecognizing structured populations, and not raising them to species).\nOur framework provides a step forward towards standardization and\nincreasing reproducibility of species delimitations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114337.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114338.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114340.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114342.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114343.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114339.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haeterini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114341.phy"}]}
