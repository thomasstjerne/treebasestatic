I.","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 19","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 60-72","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Restriction site maps of the chloroplast DNA of four tree\nferns (Alsophila bryophila, Cyathea furfuracea, Sphaeropteris cooperi,\nand Lophosoria quadripinnata) have been constructed using four enzymes.\nGenome sizes were estimated as ranging from 161.8 kilobases for L.\nquadripinnata to 179.2 kilobases for C. furfuracea, the largest sizes\nthus far reported for ferns. Evolutionary relationships of 23 species of\nCyatheaceae were assessed by comparative chloroplast DNA restriction\nsite mapping. A total of 67 restriction site mutations, 58 of which were\nphylogenetically informative, was detected using 20 restriction enzymes.\nPhylogenetic analyses of restriction site mutations were carried out\nusing both Wagner and Dollo parsimony and the resulting monophyletic\ngroups were evaluated by bootstrapping. The data show strong support for\nthree major evolutionary lineages within the family: the Alsophila\nclade, the Cyathea clade, and the Sphaeropteris clade. The Alsophila\nclade appears to be the most basal group in the family whereas the\nCyathea and Sphaeropteris clades are derived sister groups. Comparison\nof these results to the three modern classification systems for the\nfamily demonstrates that our findings are most consistent with the\nsystem of Lellinger.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyatheaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1594.phy"}]}
