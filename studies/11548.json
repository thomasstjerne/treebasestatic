In this study we focus on the resolution of some of the most\napical branches in the Tree of Life through exploration of the\nphylogenetic relationships of darters, a species-rich clade of North\nAmerican freshwater fishes. With a near complete taxon sampling of close\nto 250 species we aim to investigate strategies for efficient\nmulti-locus data sampling and the estimation of divergence times using\nrelaxed-clock methods when a clade lacks a fossil record. Our\nphylogenetic dataset comprises a single mtDNA gene and two nuclear genes\nsampled from 245 of the 248 recognized darter species. This dense\nsampling allows us to determine if a modest amount of nuclear DNA\nsequence data can resolve relationships among closely related animal\nspecies. Darters lack a fossil record to provide age calibration priors\nin relaxed-clock analyses. Therefore, we use a near-complete species\nsampled phylogeny of the perciform clade Centrarchidae, which has a rich\nfossil record, to assess two distinct strategies of external calibration\nin relaxed-clock divergence time estimates of darters: using ages\ninferred from the fossil record and molecular evolutionary rate\nestimates. Comparison of Bayesian phylogenies inferred from mtDNA and\nnuclear genes reveal that heterospecific mtDNA is present in\napproximately 12.5% of all darter species. We identify three patterns of\nmtDNA introgression in darters: proximal mtDNA transfer, which involves\nthe transfer of mtDNA among extant and sympatric darter species,\nindeterminate introgression, which involves transfer of mtDNA from a\nlineage that cannot be confidently identified because the introgressed\nhaplotypes are not clearly referable to mtDNA haplotypes in any\nrecognized species, and deep introgression, which is characterized by\nspecies diversification within a recipient clade subsequent to the\ntransfer of heterospecific mtDNA. The results of our analyses indicate\nthat DNA sequences sampled from single copy nuclear genes can provide\nappreciable phylogenetic resolution for closely related animal species.\nA well-resolved near-complete species sampled phylogeny of darters was\nestimated with Bayesian methods using a concatenated mtDNA and nuclear\ngene dataset with all identified heterospecific mtDNA haplotypes treated\nas missing data. The relaxed clock analyses resulted in very similar\nposterior age estimates across the three sampled genes and methods of\ncalibration, and therefore offer a viable strategy for estimating\ndivergence times for clades that lack a fossil record. In addition, an\ninformative rank-free clade-based classification of darters that\npreserves the rich history of nomenclature in the group and provides\nformal taxonomic communication of darter clades was constructed using\nthe mtDNA and nuclear gene phylogeny. On the whole, the appeal of mtDNA\nfor phylogeny inference among closely related animal species is\ndiminished by the observations of extensive mtDNA introgression and by\nfinding appreciable phylogenetic signal in a modest sampling of nuclear\ngenes in our phylogenetic analyses of darters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"407","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Darters, 3 gene posterior Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_46188.phy"}]}
