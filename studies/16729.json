The description of T. stratificans sp.\nnov. is based on more than 10 specimens collected on fallen decayed wood\nin subtropical forests of Rio Grande do Sul State. The species is\nrecognized by its resupinate, poroid, golden brown, perennial basidiomes\nthat become multi-layered, dimitic hyphal system, abundant hymenial\nsetae, and subglobose to ellipsoid, brownish-yellow to ferruginous-brown\nbasidiospores. Based on nrDNA ITS sequences, Bayesian and maximum\nlikelihood phylogenetic analyses of Tropicoporus nested the new taxon in\nthe T. linteus clade. A description and illustrations of the new species\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropicoporus ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89262.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI con50majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropicoporus BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89261.phy"}]}
