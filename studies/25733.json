The study included species available in algae collections and\nthose isolated directly from the environment in Poland. As a result, the\nobtained phylogenetic tree of the Phacus genus includes 50 species, out\nof which 7 are represented on the tree for the first time (Phacus\nanacoelus, P. anomalus, P. curvicauda, P. elegans, P. lismorensis, P.\nminutus and P. stokesii) and many have been taxonomically verified. For\nall verified species, diagnostic descriptions were emended, the naming\nwas reordered and epitypes were designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121672.phy"}]}
