The species produces dimorphic, primary, and secondary\nconidiophores that form consistently greenish conidial masses on\nartificial media. It resembles therefore C. rosea f. catenulata although\nit differs from this species by less adpressed branches in the secondary\nconidiophores. The new species is also phylogenetically related to C.\nbyssicola and C. rhizophaga. Our inventory suggests that C. byssicola,\nC. chloroleuca, C. pseudochroleuca, C. rhizophaga, C. rogersoniana, and\nC. rosea commonly occur in native and agriculturally used soils of the\nCerrado and Amazon Forest. Using sequences available from two\ngenomesequenced strains employed as biological control agents, we\nconfirm the identity of the European strain IK726 as C. rosea and\nidentify strain 67-1 from China as C. chloroleuca.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clonostachys spp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clonostachys spp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97494.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clonostachys spp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97493.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97495.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clonostachys spp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97496.phy"}]}
