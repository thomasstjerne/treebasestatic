Perenniporia tibetica is\ncharacterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate basidiocarps with\ncream-buff to pinkish buff pore surface and white to cream colored\nrhizomorphs, a dimitic hyphal system with slightly dextrinoid and\ndistinctly cyanophilous skeletal hyphae, and its basidiospores are\nellipsoid, truncate or not, strongly dextrinoid and cyanophilous, 6.78.7\n´ 5.36.8 µm. Its preliminary phylogenetic relationships are inferred\nbased on sequence data from the ribosomal ITS and LSU regions, both\nsuggest that Perenniporia tibetica formed a distinct lineage in the\ngenus Perenniporia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perenniporia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64877.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perenniporia ITS+LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64878.phy"}]}
