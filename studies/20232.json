However, the interplay between abiotic and\nbiotic factors driving the evolution and distribution of Indo-Pacific\ninsects remains largely unexplored. We focus on the trap-jaw ant genus\nOdontomachus to elucidate the roles of paleogeography and ecology for\nthe evolutionary success of insects in tropical and subtropical\nenvironments. The origin of Odontomachus ants (3945 Ma) coincided with\nthe warm climate of the early Cenozoic, and its ancestral widespread\ndistribution in the Oriental and New World regions is in line with the\nBoreotropical para-tropical rainforests dominating the Northern\nHemisphere. Long-distance dispersal from the New World along the\nEquatorial Pacific has significantly contributed to the extant ant\ndiversity of the Indo-Pacific region. Trans-Pacific dispersal events in\nOdontomachus are reported for the mid-Miocene, Pliocene, and modern\nhuman-mediated spread. Biotic interactions and shifts in habitat\npreferences, as suggested by the original taxon cycle hypothesis, may\nhave facilitated further geographical range expansion across distinct\nMelanesian ant lineages over the past 10 Ma. Overall, Indo-Pacific ants’\ndiversity and distribution have likely been modulated by\npaleoenvironmental changes, including ancient climate and geographical\nmodifications, as well as ecological interactions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Odontomachus","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Odontomachus Time-Calibrated tree using Birth-Death\nmodel","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_99994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Odontomachus","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Odontomachus Time-Calibrated tree using FBD model","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_99995.phy"}]}
