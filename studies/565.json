A\n437 bp portion of the 16S mitochondrial and a 1149 bp 5â€™ portion of the\nnuclear large sub-unit rRNA molecule were sequenced for 53\nproteocephalidean cestodes (representing nine subfamilies and 22 genera)\nand for one outgroup species. Parsimony and distance-based analyses of\nthe two databases, alone and combined, failed to support the monophyly\nof the two traditionally accepted families, of numerous subfamilies\n(with the exception of the Rudolphielliinae and Othinoscolescinae which\nwere validated in our analysis) and of various genera, including the\ngenus Nomimoscolex (Woodland), Ophiotaenia (La Rue) as well as the type\ngenus Proteocephalus (Weinland). Palaearctic Proteocephalus species\nnevertheless constituted a well defined clade. The two genes globally\nyielded compatible results, however the nuclear ribosomal gene provided\na better resolution of relations among Proteocephalidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteocephalidea 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3489.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proteocephalidea 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3490.phy"}]}
