This palm foliage\npresumably carries along diverse fungi whose taxonomic and functional\ndiversity have not been addressed so far. The present study investigated\nBotryosphaeriaceae fungi associated with foliage of palm species\nChamaedorea elegans, C. metallica, C. seifrizii, Dypsis lutescens and\nLodoicea maldivica imported from Mexico. Six species were identified\nusing combined morphological characterisation and multilocus\nphylogenetic analyses based on ITS, TEF-1Î±, TUB2 and RPB2. Besides\nEndomelanconiopsis endophytica, Lasiodiplodia brasiliensis and L.\neuphorbicola, two new species, namely L. lodoiceae sp. nov. and L.\nmexicanensis sp. nov are proposed. Apart from E. endophytica mostly\nknown as endophyte, L. brasiliensis and L. euphorbicola are responsible\nfor different rot diseases and dieback of important tropical crop\nplants. In pathogenicity tests on the temperate pome fruits apple and\npear, all the six Botryosphaeriaceae species induced necrotic lesions at\ndifferent degree of severity, with highest aggressiveness of L.\neuphorbicola and L. mexicanensis on apple and of L. mexicanensis on\npear. The results indicate that tropical palm foliage can be pathway of\npotentially pathogenic fungi that may give rise to concerns with regard\nto plant health in the destination countries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS+TEF+TUB+RPB2 tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132853","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132853.phy"}]}
