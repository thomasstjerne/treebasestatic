Results To examine the degree of\ncongruence between the phylogenies of nine Anicetus species and their\nscale insect hosts, we used DNA sequence data from mitochondrial (COI)\nand nuclear (28S-D2) regions to reconstruct the phylogeny of Anicetus\nspecies, and analyzed the level of cophylogeny by using distance-based\nand tree-based methods. Conclusions Cophylogenetic analyses indicated a\nsignificant fit between trees using distance-based tests, but no\nsignificant cospeciation signal using tree-based tests, suggesting the\npresence of parasite sorting on related host species. Our results\nprovide insight into the diversification process of Anicetus species\nparasitizing scale insects.","trees":[{"tree_label":"parasitoid","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anicetus parasitoids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Host","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scale Insect Hosts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69165.phy"}]}
