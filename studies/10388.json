Phylogenetic\nanalyses identify two primary groups: a morphologically diverse group\nfrom western South America, characterized by orange fruits, and a\nprimarily Mesoamerican clade with black/purple fruit and little\nmorphological diversity. We also identify an early diverging lineage of\nJaltomata species with red fruits which is sister to the rest of the\ngenus. Ancestral character state reconstruction supports a view of the\ncommon ancestor of the genus originating in South America and having\nrotate corollas similar to many species of Solanum. In addition, we\ninfer independent colonizations of lomas habitats by Jaltomata species\nand show a correlation between red nectar production and campanulate\nfloral form in multiple lineages, suggesting a common evolutionary\nsyndrome related to pollination.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Jaltomata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7809.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Jaltomata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7808.phy"}]}
