Its major diagnostic features are white, minutely and densely\naculeate hymenial surface, colorless generative hyphae, colorless, in\nmass pale colored, narrow, moderately encrusted skeletal-like hyphae in\naculeal trama and ellipsoid basidiospores. Bayesian inference of the\nphylogeny based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial 28S\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene sequences showed that phylogenetic distance\nbetween F. alba and F. gossypina is near equal to the distance between\nmorphologically well-delimited species, F. gossypina and F. brevidens.\nMorphology description, basidiomata photographs, micromorphology\ndrawings and scanning electron microscopic images of crystalline\ndeposits on skeletal-like hyphae, are provided for the new species. A\nkey to the all known species of Fibrodontia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fibrodontia & allied fungi LSU Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64544.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fibrodontia & allied fungi ITS Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64543.phy"}]}
