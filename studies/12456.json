Traditional approaches to taxonomy and phylogeny are\nconfounded by multiple factors, including the conservative and often\nconvergent morphology of workers and the rarity of reproductive castes\nin collections. Monophyly of Stenamma and relationships within the genus\nare uncertain as nearly all previous taxonomic work has been regional in\nscope. Furthermore, the sister group to Stenamma has not been well\nestablished. Here an extensive molecular dataset consisting of ten genes\n(∼8 kb of data), 48 ingroup taxa (20 Nearctic, 6 Palaearctic and 22\nNeotropical) and 8 outgroup taxa (6 closely related non-Stenamma and 2\nadditional myrmicines) is used to investigate the broad-scale phylogeny\nand evolutionary history of Stenamma. Phylogenetic analysis is performed\nunder maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks on individual genes and\nseveral alternate concatenated datasets, which are used to investigate\nthe effects of inclusion or exclusion of COI and intronic regions. The\ntiming of Stenamma evolution is inferred in beast and ancestral areas\nare reconstructed using both the s-diva and DEC methods, as implemented\nin the programs rasp and lagrange, respectively. Stenamma is revealed as\nmonophyletic with high support and tentatively is sister to a group of\nNew World species placed currently in Aphaenogaster Mayr and Messor\nForel. Within Stenamma, two major clades are recovered: a ‘Holarctic\nclade’ (HOC) and a ‘Middle American clade’ (MAC). The HOC consists of\nthe European S. striatulum Emery sister to two well-supported groups,\nthe informal ‘debile’ and ‘brevicorne’ clades. The ‘brevicorne’ clade is\nentirely Nearctic, whereas the ‘debile’ clade includes both Nearctic and\nPalaearctic representatives. The MAC occurs from the southern United\nStates to northern South America and, with the exception of S.\nhuachucanum Smith, is almost completely isolated geographically from the\nHOC. It includes a depauperate northern clade and the ‘MAC core’, which\nis a diverse assemblage of wet forest adapted species found throughout\nCentral America. Divergence dating and biogeographic reconstruction show\nthat Stenamma is most likely to have originated in the Nearctic at the\nEoceneOligocene boundary (∼35 Ma) and diversified more rapidly at 16 and\n8 Ma for the HOC and MAC, respectively. Potential environmental factors\naffecting the evolution of Stenamma include the intense global cooling\nof the late Eocene combined with aridification and mountain building.\nThe phylogenetic results are discussed in relation to the current\nStenamma species groups and several new morphological characters are\npresented to help in identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"part3 MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51254","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51254.phy"},{"tree_label":"part6 GARLI best","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51248","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51248.phy"},{"tree_label":"part4 BEAST consensus chronogram","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51252","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51252.phy"},{"tree_label":"TPI MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51262","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51262.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51264","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51264.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ubx MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51263","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51263.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAD MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51256","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51256.phy"},{"tree_label":"ArgK MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51258","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51258.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51255","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51255.phy"},{"tree_label":"F2 MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51260","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51260.phy"},{"tree_label":"LWRh MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51257","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51257.phy"},{"tree_label":"part3 GARLI best","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51253","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51253.phy"},{"tree_label":"part4 MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51251","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51251.phy"},{"tree_label":"wg MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenamma","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51259.phy"},{"tree_label":"part6 MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenamma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51249.phy"},{"tree_label":"abdA MRBAYES consensus","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenamma","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51261.phy"},{"tree_label":"part4 GARLI best","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenamma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51250.phy"}]}
