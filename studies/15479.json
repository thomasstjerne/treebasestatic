The causal agent of the disease has\nbeen identified by various researchers as Macrophoma kuwatsukai,\nPhysalospora piricola and Botryosphaeria berengeriana f. sp. piricola,\nalthough B. dothidea is currently the more widely accepted pathogen\nname. The taxonomic uncertainty has delayed the research that is needed\nto manage effectively this destructive disease. In the present study,\ngenealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) was\napplied to pathogenic fungal isolates from apple and pear ring rot from\nseveral locations in China. Phylogenetic results based on sequences of\nfour nuclear loci (ITS, EF-1Î±, HIS and HSP) revealed the existence of\ntwo cryptic species within the examined isolates. One includes an\nex-epitype isolate of B. dothidea and the other includes an isolate that\npreviously designated as B. berengeriana f. sp. piricola.\nMorphologically, the latter species presented an appressed mycelial mat\nin Petri dishes (PDA) whereas B. dothidea displayed columns of aerial\nmycelia reaching the lids, and conidia of the latter species were longer\nthan B. dothidea. B. dothidea had a faster growth rate than the latter\nspecies under relatively high temperatures. Pathogenicity tests showed\nthat on pear stems the latter species caused large-scale cankers along\nwith blisters whereas B. dothidea was non-pathogenic, but on apple\nshoots the two fungi induced large and small wart-like prominences,\nrespectively. Overall, this cryptic species demonstrated sufficient\ngenetic variations and biological differences from B. dothidea. As a\nresult of taxonomic study, we described here the latter species as a new\ncombination, Botryosphaeria kuwatsukai and designated the epitype. Both\nB. kuwatsukai and B. dothidea are considered to be the main causal\nagents for apple ring rot in China and Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Multigene MP
