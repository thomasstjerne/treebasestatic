The\nisolates were characterized based on DNA comparisons, morphology,\nculture characteristics and host affiliation, in accordance with\nprevious descriptions. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS region, combined\nwith partial BT and TEF1 genes, showed that the isolates formed three\ndistinct groups representing three new taxa. The three new species of\nDiaporthe, D. araucanorum on Araucaria araucana, D. foikelawen on Drimys\nwinteri and D. patagonica on Aristotelia chilensis are described and\nillustrated in the present study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122970.phy"}]}
