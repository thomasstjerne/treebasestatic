Bactrodesmiastrum pyriforme sp.\nnov. is characterized by large, pyriform conidia. Bactrodesmiastrum\nobovatum comb. nov. is proposed to accommodate Janetia obovata, and the\nSpanish specimen of B. obscurum, the type species of the genus,\nrepresents the second known collection of the species worldwide.\nAnalyses of rDNA sequences confirm the distinction between B. obovatum\nand B. pyriforme and reveal their relationships with the Savoryellales\n(Sordariomycetes). Bactrodesmium diversum sp. nov. is distinguished from\nthe other species of the genus by its large, pale brown conidia with a\nconspicuous pore at each septum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bactrodesmiastrum and Bactrodesmium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106355.phy"}]}
