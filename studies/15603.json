The specimens were morphologically barely\ndistinguishable from each other, each exhibiting pseudoidium-type\nconidiophores but sexual morphs lacking. Surprisingly, based on ITS\nsequence analyses, these represented two species, E. howeana, known to\ninfect Oenothera spp., and Erysiphe cf.Â alphitoides, which has never\nbeen recorded on herbaceous plants. Both species were detected on the\ninvasive O. biennis in different parts of the world including regions\nwhere O. biennis was introduced only recently.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree based on rDNA ITS region","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75344.phy"}]}
