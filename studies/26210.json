The notable features of Volvariella\nrostricystidiata sp. nov. are the mostly broadly clavate to obovoid\ncheilocystidia with rostrate apex. The pleurocystidia are scattered,\nslender, mostly fusiform, and without rostrum. In addition, V. pulla is\nreported for the first time from Thailand. The morphology of our\ncollection matches the description of the species. Blast result also\nconfirmed the complete similarity of the sequence to the type specimen.\nThe combined ITS and nrLSU gene regions were analyzed to confirm\ntaxonomical placement and infer the phylogenetic affinities of the two\nstudied species. The Volvariella species collected have potential for\ncultivation and to be introduced as new Volvariella strains on the Thai\nmarket.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123402.phy"}]}
