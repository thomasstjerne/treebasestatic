Hydnum ovoideisporum is distinguished by pilei with deep\norange tones and strong preference for calcareous soil. It is widespread\nin the Iberian-Mediterranean area. Hydnum vesterholtii is characterized\nby its ocher to light ocher pileus, and nearly all the collections were\nmade in the Pyrenees. Both ovoid-spored species are monophyletic well\nsupported groups in the maximum parsimony and Bayesian ITS phylogenies,\nwhile the remainder of the samples assigned to H. rufescens s.l. and\nhaving globose basidiospores split into six well supported clades. The\nneed to typify the name Hydnum rufescens is discussed, and a provisional\nkey is given for the European taxa of Hydnum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnum ITS BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53442.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnum ITS BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53443.phy"}]}
