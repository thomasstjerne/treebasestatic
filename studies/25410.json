In our investigation and examination of microfungi on palms\n(Arecaceae), we found two new ascomycetous species of Fissuroma.\nFissuroma arengae and F. wallichiae sp. nov. are introduced using\nmorphological and phylogenetic evidence. The novel species have\ncoriaceous ascomata, cylindrical-clavate asci and ascospores with a\ndistinct, thin, mucilaginous sheath. Fissuroma arengae is similar to F.\nwallichiae but can be distinguished by minor morphology, host substrate\nand gene base-pair differences. Phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU,\nITS, SSU, tef1-Î± and rpb2 sequence data showed that these strains\ngrouped within Fissuroma, further confirming this genus as monophyletic.\nThe two new species are described and illustrated to support their\ntaxonomic placement. Fissuroma appears to be a highly diverse genus and\nit is likely that more research will result in numerous new taxa being\ndiscovered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fissuroma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124086.phy"}]}
