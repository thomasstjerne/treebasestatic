The combination of low similarity clustering (70%) and\nrelaxed quality-filtering (allowing up to 30 ambiguous sites per read)\nperformed the best in phylogenetic analyses at both recent and deep\ngenetic divergences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS nrDNA tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110855.phy"}]}
