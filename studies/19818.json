This sequestrate, hypogeous fungus was collected in Cameroon in\na lowland Guineo-Congolian mixed tropical rainforest in close proximity\nto ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees of the genus Uapaca (Phyllanthaceae).\nMolecular data place this fungus in Boletaceae (Boletales,\nAgaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) and inform its relationship to other\nknown epigeous and sequestrate taxa within that family. Macro- and\nmicromorphological characters, habitat, and DNA sequence data are\nprovided. Unique morphological features and a molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis of 304 sequences across the Boletales justify the recognition\nof the new genus. Kombocles bakaiana is the fourth sequestrate\nBoletaceae described from the greater African tropics, and the first to\nbe described from Cameroon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS PASTA RAxML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98370.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S PASTA RAxML","ntax":"304","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98369.phy"}]}
