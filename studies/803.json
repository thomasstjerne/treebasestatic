Cladistic analyses of DNA sequence\nvariation in the trnL intron and nuclear ribosomal ITS regions strongly\nsupport five major clades in the subfamily: Schlechtendalia,\nChuquiraga-Doniophyton, Barnadesia-Huarpea, Dasyphyllum subgenus\nDasyphyllum and a clade comprising Dasyphyllum subgenus\nArchidasyphyllum, Arnaldoa and Fulcaldea. Within Dasyphyllum subgenus\nDasyphyllum, D. hystrix has a basal position, and sect. Macrocephala is\nsupported as monophyletic, while sect. Microcephala lacks jackknife\nsupport. Within Barnadesia, B. parviflora has a very divergent ITS\nsequence and a basal position in the genus. The phylogenetic trees make\nsome sense of the great morphological variation within the subfamily,\nalthough some clades identified here lack obvious defining morphological\ncharacteristics. Optimisation of geographical distributions onto the\nmolecular phylogenies shows that the Barnadesioideae most likely\noriginated in southern South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Barnadesioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Barnadesioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1167.phy"}]}
