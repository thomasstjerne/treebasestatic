A new fungal species, Neopestalotiopsis\nvitis was isolated from the grape leaf spot in Guangxi province, China.\nInitially, small circular slightly sunken necrotic spots develop on the\nleaf surface, mainly in the inter-vein regions. Later, the spots enlarge\nrapidly and become brittle with age. Phylogenetic species recognition\nbased on multilocus analysis of the ITS, TUB2 and tef1 combined gene\nsequences coupled with morphology distinguished N. vitis from other\nspecies in the genus. This is the first report of Neopestalotiopsis\nspecies causing a disease on leaves of grapevine in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94706","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94706.phy"}]}
