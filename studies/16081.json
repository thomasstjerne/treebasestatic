Here we present a\nmolecular analysis to address the problems. Nuclear ITS and plastid\natpB-rbcL fragments were analyzed using maximum parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood, and Bayesian inference methods. Within tribe Anemoneae, two\nstrongly supported clades corresponding to subtribes Anemoninae and\nClematidinae are recovered. Anemoclema and Clematis s. l. are sister\nwithin the Clematidinae and Anemone s. l., a genus previously regarded\nas closely related to or congeneric with Anemoclema, is alone within\nAnemoninae clade. Our results clearly demonstrate that Anemoclema is\nmore closely related to Clematis than to Anemone, and thus should be\ntransferred from Anemoninae into Clematidinae. From a morphological\nperspective and with the intention of maintaining nomenclatural\nstability we suggest that Anemoclema be recognized as a second genus\nwithin Clematidinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anemoclema BI CP ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76236.phy"}]}
