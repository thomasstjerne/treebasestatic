A well-known result of this\nproblem is the ‘temporal paradox’ argument that is sometimes made\nagainst the theropod hypothesis of avian origins. Here we report on an\nexceptionally well-preserved small theropod specimen collected from the\nearliest Late Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of western Liaoning, China.\nThe specimen is referable to the Troodontidae, which are among the\ntheropods most closely related to birds. This new find refutes the\n‘temporal paradox’ and provides significant information on the temporal\nframework of theropod divergence. Furthermore, the extensive feathering\nof this specimen, particularly the attachment of long pennaceous\nfeathers to the pes, sheds new light on the early evolution of feathers\nand demonstrates the complex distribution of skeletal and integumentary\nfeatures close to the dinosaur-bird transition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Troodontidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55921.phy"}]}
