Recent studies of 18S rDNA sequence data supported an\nalliance of the DO group, but no data from Sphaeroplea and its allies\nwere included. This investigation presented a test of the phylogenetic\nhypothesis suggested by the flagellar apparatus evidence using sequence\ndata from the nuclear-encoded, small-subunit rDNA (18S) and large\nsubunit rDNA (26S) genes, combined with additional taxon sampling.\nResults from phylogenetic analyses weakly supported monophyly of\nbiflagellate DO taxa and indicated that pyrenoids with cytoplasmic\ninvaginations are present in numerous, distinct lineages. Analysis of\nboth molecular data sets supported a class Chlorophyceae comprised of at\nleast six major groups that generally correspond to currently recognized\norders or families: Chaetophorales, Chaetopeltidales, Chlamydomonadales,\nSphaeropleales, Sphaeropleaceae and Oedogoniales. In addition,\nCylindrocapsa, Elakatothrix, Treubaria and Trochiscia formed a seventh\nchlorophycean clade that is new to science. This investigation\ndemonstrated that the 26S rDNA gene provides more phylogenetic signal,\nper unit sequence, than the 18S rDNA gene and that combined analysis\nyields topologies with more robust support than independent analysis of\neither data set.
