We have previously\nidentified a ciliary opsin gene from the brachiopod Terebratalia\ntransversa, whose expression in gastrula stage embryos coincides with a\nphotoresponse behavior, suggesting the presence of a functional\nphototransduction system in these early embryos. To further evaluate the\npotential for light reception in these embryos we surveyed transcriptome\ndata to identify phototransduction genes and evaluated their expression.\nIn addition to the previously described ciliary opsin gene, we have\nidentified two Go-class opsins that are also expressed in gastrula stage\nembryos. Representative members from all classes of Gα-protein genes\nwere also expressed, with a Gα12-class gene being localized in the same\nanterior ectodermal domain as the opsin transcripts. Both CNG-class and\nTRP-class ion channels were expressed in the gastrula stage embryos, as\nwere GRK and arrestin genes, which are associated with inhibition of\nrhodopsin activity. Taken together these data support the presence of a\nfunctional phototransduction system in the early brachiopod embryo.","trees":[{"tree_label":"opsin con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"opsin Bayesian consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62477.phy"},{"tree_label":"TRP con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TRP Bayesian consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62478.phy"},{"tree_label":"Arrestin con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arrestin Bayesian consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62479.phy"},{"tree_label":"GRK con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GRK Bayesian consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62480.phy"},{"tree_label":"G-alpha con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"G-alpha Bayesian consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62481.phy"}]}
