Although these regions are mostly conserved as National\nParks due to the specific nature and biome, quite limited fungal biota\nis reported currently. We examined mushroom fungi under such environment\nand found a unique yellowish-cap Tricholoma species. Multi-gene\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis and morphological observation for the\nspecimens showed that the Tricholoma species position to the sister\nclade to T. fumosoluteum known in the North America under\nalpinesubalpine zones. The Japanese yellowish-cap Tricholoma species\nshowed larger basidium size and pileipellis hyphal width as compared to\nT. fumosoluteum, In addition, the Japanese yellowish-cap Tricholoma\nspecies had cheilocystidia on the gill edge. Thus, we describe the\nfungus as T. alpinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131730.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma gpd","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131736.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma atp6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131732.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma mtSSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131737.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131725.phy"}]}
