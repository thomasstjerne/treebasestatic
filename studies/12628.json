Its\nevolution depends on the sexual selective pressure mainly leaded by the\ninterspecific interaction. In sympatry with Close Related Species (CRS),\nthe selection for specific signals to avoid mismatch make this pressure\nstabilizing. This leads to a saltationnal evolution across phylogenetic\nlineage. Conversely, in allopatry with CRS, as in many insular systems,\nthe lack of hydridization risk may promote a relaxation of the\nstabilizing selection and change the courtship signal evolution. We\ntested this hypothesis using genetic and chemical comparative approachs\non a courtship signal trait, the Sexual Marking Pheronones (SMP) of four\nbumblebee species including Coriscan insular (allopatry with CRS) and\nmainland (sympatry with CRS) population. Analyses showed 1) genetic and\nSMP differentions of insulars and, 2) a lower genetic variability and a\nhigher SMP variability of insular. A correlation between the neutral\nloci distance and the SMP distance was detected for the insulars.\nDifferentiations of Corsican bumblebees have lead to a rapid speciation\nin about 15000 years. The incrase of the SMP variability and the\ncorrelation genetic-SMP suggested a relaxation of the stabilizing\nselection on the courtship signal leading to a gradual differentiation\nin insular system with species free of their CRS.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"200","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52397.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52402.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52405.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"205","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52408","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52408.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52394.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"200","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52399.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52395.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52411.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52396.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52403","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52403.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP5","ntax":"201","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52404.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"205","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52406","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52406.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP4","ntax":"205","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52407","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52407.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"200","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52398.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52401.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52400.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52410","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52410.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52409","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52409.phy"}]}
