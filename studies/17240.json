Currently, its distribution is restricted only to\nthe type locality (Carrizalillo, Atacama Region, Chile) and despite\nbeing a highly variable species no study has provided a clear diagnosis\nor color photographs. Here, we provide a phylogenetic hypothesis for the\nL. nigromaculatus group based on mitochondrial DNA, where L. silvai is\nstrongly supported as the sister taxon to L. zapallarensis. Also, we\nprovide a detailed diagnosis, description of variation, and four new\nlocality records for L. silvai. In addition, we call attention to\nseveral taxonomic issues with the L. nigromaculatus group that need to\nbe solved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Liolaemus ND2 ML tree","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liolaemus nigromaculatus group ND2 MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86024.phy"}]}
