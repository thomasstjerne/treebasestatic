Aspicilia species were distributed\namong three main well supported groups and one group with low support\nthat included the type species; a division of the family into five\ngenera is proposed. The old names Circinaria and Sagedia are\nreintroduced for groups not including A. cinerea, the type of Aspicilia.\nThe monotypic Megaspora is closely related to Circinaria, while\nLobothallia is the sister group of the other Megasporaceae genera.\nAspicilia recedens and A. farinosa are transferred to Lobothallia.\nSpecies of the ‘Sphaerothallia group’ are nested in Circinaria.\nAspilidea is not a member of Megasporaceae but seems to be more closely\nrelated to Ochrolechiaceae. Aspilidea myrinii is neotypified, and\nlectotypes are designated for Aspicilia gibbosa, A. leprosescens and\nLecanora gibbosula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of 52 species of Pertusariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_19966.phy"}]}
