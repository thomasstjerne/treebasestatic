It has been placed variously within the bromeliad subfamily\nTillandsioideae along with five other recognized tillandsioid genera\n(Catopsis, Guzmania, Mezobromelia, Tillandsia, and Vriesea); in its own\ntribe of the tillandsioid subfamily; and, alternatively, has been\nconsidered to be a subgenus within Pitcairnia (subfamily\nPitcairnioideae). New data on chromosomes and stigma architecture\nprovide, respectively, plesiomorphies and autapomorphies relative to the\nfamilyâ€™s sister taxon. All available data including morphology and\nanatomy, as well as the cladistic analysis, support retention of\nGlomeropitcairnia within subfamily Tillandsioideae and suggest that the\ngenus is sister taxon to the most recent common ancestor of the\ntillandsioid genera, Guzmania and Mezobromelia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomeropitcairnia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1598.phy"}]}
