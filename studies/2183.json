The species is known only from eastern North\nAmerica and is reported here for the first time from states in New\nEngland and Canada. A taxonomic description is provided, including the\nfirst photographic record of the species and discussion of its\nevolutionary history. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis the\nspecies is most closely related with significant measures of statistical\nsupport to two other narrowly endemic species of Inocybe: one also from\neastern North America (I. tahquamenonensis) and another from northern\nEurope (I. relicina), the latter is the type of the genus Inocybe. These\nthree species constitute the clade that corresponds with section\nInocybe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tubarioides (Bayesian tree with highest ln L)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_377.phy"}]}
