D27 expression is known to be responsive to phosphate starvation.\nIn Medicago truncatula and rice (Oryza sativa) this transcriptional\nresponse requires the GRAS-type proteins NSP1 and NSP2; both proteins\nare essential for rhizobium induced root nodule formation in legumes. In\nline with this, we questioned whether MtNSP1-MtNSP2 dependent MtD27\nregulation is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CCD","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizobium Strigolactones CCD","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91457.phy"},{"tree_label":"D27","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizobium Strigolactones D27","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91456.phy"}]}
