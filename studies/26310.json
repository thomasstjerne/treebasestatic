The Seto Inland Sea is a shallow enclosed sea in\nJapan, but geological evidence showed that a large freshwater drainage\nhad intermittently appeared in this area between the late Pliocene and\nPleistocene. Here we demonstrated that this paleodrainage greatly\naffected the genetic variation of the East Asian freshwater snails,\nSemisulcospira spp. We found that the mtDNA haplotypes originated in the\nLake Biwa endemic Semisulcospira species at the upstream side of the\npaleodrainage were frequently observed in the riverine Semisulcospira\nspecies at its downstream side. The genome-wide DNA and morphological\nanalyses consistently showed that there was no clear evidence of nuclear\nintrogression between the Lake Biwa endemics and riverine species. These\nresults suggest that the large paleodrainage had facilitated\nmitochondrial introgression and had broadly spread the introgressed\nmtDNA haplotypes to its downstream region around the Seto Inland Sea.\nOur study highlights the role of paleodrainages in shaping the genetic\nvariation of freshwater organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123713","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123713.phy"}]}
