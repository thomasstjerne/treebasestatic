Two most\nparsimonious hypotheses corroborate the monophyly of Acestrorhynchus but\ndiffer in the hypothesized relationships of Acestrorhynchus heterolepis.\nThree proposed supraspecific assemblages are at least partially\ncorrelated with groups of species previously diagnosed on the basis of\ncolour pattern: (1) Acestrorhynchus britskii, Acestrorhynchus\ngrandoculis, Acestrorhynchus microlepis, and Acestrorhynchus minimus;\n(2) Acestrorhynchus falcirostris, Acestrorhynchus isalineae, and A.\nAcestrorhynchus nasutus; and (3) Acestrorhynchus abbreviatus,\nAcestrorhynchus altus, Acestrorhynchus falcatus, Acestrorhynchus\nlacustris, and Acestrorhynchus pantaneiro. In one hypothesis A.\nheterolepis is proposed as the closest relative of the clade formed by\nA. falcirostris, A. isalineae, and A. nasutus, and in the alternative\nhypothesis it is proposed as a sister species of the clade formed by A.\nabbreviatus, A. altus, A. falcatus, A. lacustris, and A. pantaneiro.\nRelationships among species of the latter clade remain unresolved. Two\nindependent episodes of reduction of body size are hypothesized to have\noccurred within the genus: one associated with the clade formed by A.\ngrandoculis and A. minimus, and the other with the clade formed by A.\nisalineae and A. nasutus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 25A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acestrorhynchus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53938.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 25B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acestrorhynchus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53939.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 26","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acestrorhynchus spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53940.phy"}]}
