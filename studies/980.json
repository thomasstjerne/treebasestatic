The\nascospores are 1â€“3 transseptate and hyaline at first but become\nmelanized and rough after release, as is the case in some members of\nMassarina and Lophiostoma. SSU rDNA data indicate that it is closely\nrelated to M. eburnea but is biotrophic in leaves of sugar cane and not\ncorticolous, the ascomata are less melanized, and it has Stagonospora-\nand Phoma-like synanamorphs, not a Ceratophoma-like anamorph. A second\nspecies, Leptosphaeria taiwanensis, is transferred to Saccharicola. It\ndiffers in slightly larger, normally 1-septate, hyaline spores with more\nattenuated ends. The family Massarinaceae is resurrected to accommodate\nMassarina s. str., Keissleriella, Saccharicola and Helminthosporium.\nThese genera formed a clade with 100% bootstrap support in a parsimony\nanalysis of SSU rDNA sequences from 38 ascomycetes, 30 of them members\nof Pleosporales (including Melanommatales).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saccharicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5788.phy"}]}
