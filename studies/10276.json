Unfortunately, our knowledge of the biology and\nevolution of most of these groups is limited. Typhloscolecidae and\nLopadorhynchidae are two such examples of recognized families of\nholopelagic annelids about which little is known. Both groups have a\nlimited number of known species (13 and 15, respectively) and are rarely\ndiscussed in the literature other than to note occurrence. Placing these\ngroups in a phylogenetic context has been difficult due to their\nseemingly unique morphology, and, to the best of our knowledge, lack of\nmolecular data. Nonetheless, previous authors have suspected that they\nare members of Phyllodocida and perhaps within Phyllodocidae. To test\nsuch hypotheses, we have employed nuclear 18S and 28S ribosomal data in\nboth a Bayesian inference and a maximum likelihood framework. The\nresultant topology indicates that typhloscolecids and lopadorhynchs are\nsister taxa nested within Phyllodocidae near another holopelagic taxon,\nalciopids. Whereas posterior probabilities strongly support this\nplacement, an AU hypothesis testing approach and bootstrap values are\nmore equivocal but both still strongly suggest Phyllodocidae\naffiliations. Recognition of Typhloscolecidae and Lopadorhynchidae as\nannelid families is called into question.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllodocidae, ML tree of 18S & 28S rRNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6901.phy"}]}
