The novel species exhibited conidiogenesis on 7th\nday of incubation on potato dextrose agar (26 °C) and cleistothecioid\nascomata on 14th day of incubation (40 °C). Colonies were floccose,\nirregular having undulate margin with an umbonate elevation.\nPhylogenetic analysis of the combined sequences of the internal\ntranscribed spacer, LSU rRNA and the β-tubulin genes confirmed the\nspecies novelty within the genus Westerdykella. Growth pattern study of\nthe organism showed early hyphal growth, followed by pycnidia formation,\nand changes in structural form of fruiting bodies upon 14 days of\nincubation. Morphological and phylogenetic analysis suggest a novel\nspecies Westerdykella indica and first report on extracellular glycosyl\nhydrolases production. Xylanase and cellulase activities in the crude\nfermentation extract were 1.855 and 0.234 IU ml-1 min-1,\nrespectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian tree","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Multigene analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_129389.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML analysis tree","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129390.phy"}]}
