Rhizochaete is characterized by a smooth to\ntuberculate, pellicular hymenophore and hyphal cords that turn red or\nviolet in potassium hydroxide, monomitic hyphal system of simple or\nnodose septate hyphae, cystidia, and small, cylindrical to subglobose\nbasidiospores. Morphologically, it is most similar to Phanerochaete.\nAnalyses of nuclear ribosomal and internal transcribed spacer region\nsequence data support a close relationship of Rhizochaete to\nPhanerochaete. The new taxon R. brunnea, from southern Argentina, is\ndescribed and illustrated. In addition, the new combinations R.\namericana, R. borneensis, R. filamentosa, R. fouquieriae and R. radicata\nare proposed. A key to the species of Rhizochaete is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4217.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS maximum likelihood","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4218.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MrBayes tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4219.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4220.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU maximum likelihood","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4221.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU MrBayes tree 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4222.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5859.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU rDNA Maximum likelihood","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5860.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU rDNA MrByes tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete–a new genus of phanerochaetoid fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5861.phy"}]}
