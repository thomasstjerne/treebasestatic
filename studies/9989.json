The two new species have one-septate ascospores. C.\nanglusa resembles C. gracilis by having narrow one-septate hyaline\nascospore however they differ in ascomata and ascospore dimensions and\nin pure culture characteristics. Single ascospore culture of C. anglusa\nproduces the conidia of its anamorph. V. anglusa is different from the\nother two Varicosporina species by having conidial branches that are\nfilamentous, hypha-like that are disarticulating into two- or one-celled\nfragments. C. portsaidica is morphologically similar to C. cinnamomia\nbut they differ in the dimensions, shape and ornamentation of the\nascospores. The new taxa were confirmed to be divergent from similar\nCorollospora species based on their phylogenetic analyses of partial\nsequences of the LSU rDNA region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corollospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6083.phy"}]}
