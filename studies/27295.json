As a result,\none isolate obtained from Gamblea innovans formed a clade with B.\nqingyuanensis from China. The other 49 isolates formed a large clade\nwith B. dothidea epitype and its related species. Isolates from Brown\nblight of walnut and Guignardia canker of Japanese alder formed small\nsubclades of B. dothidea, respectively. It was suggested that the host\nspecies and morphological characterstics may be effective in species\ndistinction in this genus. However, the resolution for species\ndistinction by the multi-region analyses adopted in the present study\nwas seemed not to be enough to distinguish B. dothidea species complex.\nTherefore, we need alternative and additional phylogenetic approach that\nwill divide species complex of B. dothidea. In addition, morphological,\nbiological, and ecological characterization are necessary to reveal\nprobable several species included in the species complex of B.\ndothidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128808.phy"}]}
