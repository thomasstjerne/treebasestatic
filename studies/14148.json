Recent molecular\nanalyses have resurrected 2 species from within these clades: 1 from the\nPacific coastal lowlands (T. atrovarius), and another from the highlands\nof the Sierra Madre Occidental (T. sheldoni). In this study, multi-locus\ngenetic analyses of 3 mitochondrial and 5 nuclear genes reveal a\npreviously undescribed 3rd species apparently restricted to the Sierra\ndel Nayar of northeastern Nayarit. In addition to molecular and\nchromosomal studies of this new species, cranial morphology is analyzed\nto help distinguish it from its congeners. This taxon, T. nayarensis, is\ndescribed herein, and a key to distinguishing the 3 species of Thomomys\nin northeastern Nayarit is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62968.phy"}]}
