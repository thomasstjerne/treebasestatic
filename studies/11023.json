World wide surveys of diseases on these trees have\nyielded a large collection of Ceratocystis isolates from dying trees or\nfrom wounds on their stems. The aim of this study was to characterise\nthese isolates and to consider their relatedness to each other. Culture\nappearance, morphological features and a distinctive fruity odour in all\ncultures were typical of species in the Ceratocystis fimbriata sensu\nlato (s.l.) complex. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences for the combined\nITS, βt and EF1-α gene regions revealed a genetically diverse group of\nisolates residing in a single large clade, which were distinct from all\nother species in the C. fimbriata s.l. complex. Based on morphology and\nphylogenetic inference, the Eucalyptus isolates are recognised as a new\nspecies, described here as C. eucalypticola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
