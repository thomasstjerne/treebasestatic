Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian inference of separate and combined matrices of\nthe chloroplast and ITS data sets strongly support the monophyly of\nOreomyrrhis and its sister relationships with the North American\nChaerophyllum. Relationships among other major clades with Chaerophyllum\nare congruence with previous studies. Based on the well supported\nphylogenetic relationship, we propose to transfer all currently\nrecognized taxa of Oreomyrrhis into Chaerophyllum. We also propose to\nuse North American clade and oreomyrrhis clade as unranked names to\ndesignate the two well supported clades within sect. Chaerophyllum, an\nalternative that can avoid nomenclatural cascades resulted from rank\nchanges. The proposed nomenclatural changes include 3 new names,\nChaerophyllum australianum, Chaerophyllum guatemalense, and\nChaerophyllum novae-zelandiae, and 26 new combinations, Chaerophyllum\nandicola, Chaerophyllum argentum, Chaerophyllum azorellaceum,\nChaerophyllum basicola, Chaerophyllum borneense, Chaerophyllum brevipes,\nChaerophyllum buwaldianum, Chaerophyllum colensoi, Chaerophyllum\ncolensoi var. delicatulum, Chaerophyllum colensoi var. hispidum,\nChaerophyllum colensoi var. multifidum, Chaerophyllum daucoides,\nChaerophyllum eriopodum, Chaerophyllum gunnii, Chaerophyllum\ninvolucratum, Chaerophyllum lineare, Chaerophyllum nanhuense,\nChaerophyllum orizabae, Chaerophyllum papuanum, Chaerophyllum plicatum,\nChaerophyllum pulvinificum, Chaerophyllum pumilum, Chaerophyllum\nramosum, Chaerophyllum sessiliflorum, Chaerophyllum taiwanianum, and\nChaerophyllum tolucanum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, ITS Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_738.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, cpDNA Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_739.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, ITS likelihood tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_740.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, cpDNA likelihood\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_741.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, Combined Bayesian\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_742.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaerophyllum and Oreomyrrhis, Combined likelihood\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_743.phy"}]}
