However,\ninformation about the Hsfs gene family in these Rosaceae species is\nlimited, and the evolutionary history of the Hsfs gene family also\nremains unresolved. Results: In this study, 137 Hsf genes were\nidentified from six Rosaceae species (Pyrus bretschneideri, Malus Ã\ndomestica, Prunus persica, Fragaria vesca, Prunus mume, and Pyrus\ncommunis), 29 of which came from Chinese white pear, designated as\nPbHsf. Based on the structural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis\nof these sequences, the Hsf family genes could be classified into three\nmain groups (classes A, B, and C). Segmental and dispersed duplications\nwere the primary forces underlying Hsf gene family expansion in the\nRosaceae. Most of the PbHsf duplicated gene pairs were dated back to the\nrecent whole-genome duplication (WGD, 30â“45 million years ago (MYA)).\nPurifying selection also played a critical role in the evolution of Hsf\ngenes. Transcriptome data demonstrated that the expression levels of the\nPbHsf genes were widely different. Six PbHsf genes were upregulated in\nfruit under naturally increased temperature. Conclusion: A comprehensive\nanalysis of Hsf genes was performed in six Rosaceae species, and 137\nfull length Hsf genes were identified. The results presented here will\nundoubtedly be useful for better understanding the complexity of the Hsf\ngene family and will facilitate functional characterization in future\nstudies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chinese white pear heat shock transcription factors NJ\nPb At Pt Hsfs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80097.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chinese white pear heat shock transcription factors NJ\nof Rosaceae Hsfs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80100.phy"}]}
