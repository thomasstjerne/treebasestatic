Typical macro- and microscopical\ncharacteristics indicate that both of 16 these two species belong to\nAmanita section Amanita but differ from other species. Amanita kal-17\nasininus is characterized by having a greyish yellow pileus covering\nwith a conical to granuliform, 18 yellowish white volval remnant; the\npresence of clamps, and a broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid basid-19\niospore. Amanita ravicrocina is characterized by having a brown to\ngreyish orange pileus covering 20 with a patchy, white volval remnant; a\ncollar-like volval remnant on the stipe, and a subglobose to 21 broadly\nellipsoid basidiospore. Multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of partial\nnuclear rDNA internal 22 transcribed spacers regions (ITS), partial\nnuclear rDNA large subunit region (nrLSU), RNA poly-23 merase II second\nlargest subunit (RPB2), partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha\n(TEF1-Î±) and 24 beta-tubulin gene (TUB) also revealed that positions of\nA. kalasininus and A. ravicrocina are well-25 supported within Amanita\nsection Amanita, but form as distinct lineages. The detailed\nmorphologi-26 cal features, line-drawing illustration and comparison\nwith morphological similar taxa are pro-27 vided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134888","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134888.phy"}]}
