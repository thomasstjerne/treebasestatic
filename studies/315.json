A Hypothetical Ancestral Sipunculan is proposed and\nprobable evolutionary pathways are presented. The PHYLIP Camin-Sokal and\nthe PAUP Wagner parsimony programs are used, as well as Diceâ€™s\nsimilarity coefficient and UPGMA cluster analysis. These provided both\ncladistic and a hybrid phenetic/cladistic analyses. Only 5 of the 12\ncharacters are clearly not homoplastic. While monophyly is not\ndemonstrated in all cases, the 17 genera are now grouped into six\nfamilies, four orders, and two classes as a result of using\nevolutionary, phenetic, and phylogenetic methodologies. The selective\nremoval of homoplastic characters within the two classes did not\nsignificantly alter the composition of the orders or families. The\nevident congruence among these methods affirms the value of a synthetic\napproach.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sipuncula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_545.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sipuncula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_546.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sipuncula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_547.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sipuncula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_624.phy"}]}
