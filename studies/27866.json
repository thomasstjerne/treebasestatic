Since the first\nconfident molecular phylogenetic placement of Hydnoraceae among\nPiperales, different studies have recovered various contradictory\ntopologies. Most phylogenetic hypotheses were inferred using only a few\nloci and have had incomplete taxon sampling at the genus level. Based on\nthese results and an online survey of taxonomic opinion, the Angiosperm\nPhylogeny Group lumped both Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae in\nAristolochiaceae; however, the latter family continues to have unclear\nrelationships to the aforementioned taxa. Here we present extensive\nphylogenomic tree reconstructions based on up to 137 loci from all three\nsubcellular genomes for all genera of Piperales. We infer relationships\nbased on a variety of phylogenetic methods, explore instances of\nphylogenomic discordance between the subcellular genomes, and test\nalternative topologies. Based on these phylogenomic results and a\nconsideration of the principles of phylogenetic classification, we\npropose to exclude Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae from the broad\ncircumscription of Aristolochiaceae, and instead favor recognition of\nfour monophyletic families in the perianth-bearing Piperales:\nAristolochiaceae, Asaraceae, Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae, with six\nfamilies total in the order.","trees":[{"tree_label":"nc_loci","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piperales nc loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Jost_2021_pt_loci","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piperales pt loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129384.phy"},{"tree_label":"137 concat","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piperales 137 concat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129387.phy"},{"tree_label":"mt_loci","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piperales mt loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129385.phy"}]}
