Hemiaustroboletus\nis supported by morphological and molecular data using LSU and RPB2\nregions. The genus is characterized by pileate-stipitate basidiomata;\npurple, brown, reddish-brown, orange-brown to dark brown vinaceous\npileus; whitish or lilac to vinaceous context, and a subclavate stipe.\nMicroscopically, it is characterized by ornamented, slightly verrucose,\ncracked to perforated brown basidiospores. Two species are described\nwithin the genus, Hemiaustroboletus vinaceobrunneus and H. vinaceus.\nAlthough both species are distributed in subtropical forests in Mexico.\nAdditional GenBank unidentified voucher or environmental nrITS sequences\nshowed that the genus is transcontinental distributed in the holartic\n(Canada, China, Mexico, and United States). Hemiaustroboletus vinaceus\nis morphologically similar to Austroboletus gracilis, therefore they\nhave been confused. This study presents the phylogenetic placement,\nmicroscopic structures, detailed morphological descriptions and\nphotographs of both new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133332","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133332.phy"}]}
