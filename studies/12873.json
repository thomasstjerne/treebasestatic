Two of them were described as new\nspecies to science, namely Hypoderma minterii and Lophodermium\njohnstonii. The third one was a known species, Hypoderma berberidis. The\nphylogenetic relationships of these species within Rhytismatales were\nanalyzed based on partial large subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA and\ninternal transcriber spacer ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the\nrhytismatalean species on Berberis, unlike most species on pines, were\nnot closely related. Three ITS sequences of Lirula macrospora in GenBank\nwere likely from misidentified sources. A key to species of\nRhytismatales on Berberis worldwide was also given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53704","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53704.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53703","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53703.phy"}]}
