We report here its occurrence in the UK,\nGermany and, for the first time, Switzerland. Based on morphological and\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) patterns, this novel pathogen\nappeared similar to the anamorph of a common North American powdery\nmildew, Erysiphe symphoricarpi (syn. Microsphaera symphoricarpi). A\nphylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences\nof the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of an English and a North American snowberry\npowdery mildew fungus showed that they are conspecific. Ascomata of the\npathogen were found only in one European collection, that being in\nGermany in 2002. The similarity in morphology of the ascomata also\nconfirmed the co-identity of the European and American snowberry powdery\nmildews.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP consensus","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"snowberry powdery mildew","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_410.phy"},{"tree_label":"ME tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"snowberry powdery mildew","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4046.phy"}]}
