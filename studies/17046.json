A. mesenterica has bigger\nbasidiospores measured as 14â“17 Ã 4.7â“5.2 Âµm, capitate cystidioles,\nand a distribution in Europe. A. asiae-orientalis has smaller\nbasidiospores measured as 12.5â“14.2 Ã 5â“6 Âµm and capitate\ncystidioles, and is found in China. A. braziliana has the smallest\nbasidiospores among the complex measured as 11.5â“12 Ã 4.5 Âµm, lacks\ncystidioles, and is discovered in Brazil. Illustrated descriptions of\nthe two new species are given based on the materials in the present\nstudy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111518.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111519.phy"}]}
