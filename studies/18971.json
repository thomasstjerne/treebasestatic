Additionally, many characters used in\nthe taxonomy of the group have ontogenetic and intraspecific variation,\nand demand new and consistent assessments to establish their correct\nhomologies. Consequently, Staurozoa is in need of a thorough systematic\nrevision. The aim of this study is to propose a comprehensive\nphylogenetic hypothesis for Staurozoa, providing the first phylogenetic\nclassification for the group. According to our working hypothesis based\non a combined set of molecular data (mitochondrial markers COI, 16S, and\nnuclear markers ITS, 18S, and 28S), the traditional suborders\nCleistocarpida (animals with claustrum) and Eleutherocarpida (animals\nwithout claustrum) are not monophyletic. Instead, our results show that\nstaurozoans are divided into two groups, herein named Amyostaurida and\nMyostaurida, which can be distinguished by the absence/presence of\ninterradial longitudinal muscles in the peduncle, respectively. We\npropose a taxonomic revision at the family and genus levels that\npreserves the monophyly of taxa. We provide a key for staurozoan genera\nand discuss the evolution of the main characters used in staurozoan\ntaxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S_parsimony_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_PA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94685.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_parsimony_tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_PA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94312.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_BA_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined_BA_tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94693.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_ML_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94689.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S_parsimony_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S_PA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined_ML_tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94692.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_BA_tree","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94455.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_ML_tree","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94454.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S_parsimony_tree","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_PA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94453.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_ML_tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94314.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_BA_tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94458.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI_BA_tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94315.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_ML_tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94457.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_parsimony_tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS_parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94456.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S_ML_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined_parsimony_tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined_PA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94691.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S_BA_tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S_BA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94687.phy"}]}
