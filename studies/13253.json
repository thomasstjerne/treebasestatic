However, the impact of polar\nauxin transport and PIN proteins on the development of non-seed plant\nspecies and green algal lineages is largely unknown. The key in\ncomparative biology in order to understand the origin of fundamental\nplant processes is the comparison with the appropriate related\norganisms, which in many cases will be streptophyte algae, the closest\nliving relatives of land plants. Using recently available sequence\ninformation from these and other non-seed plant species, we have\nconstructed a preliminary phylogenetic framework and present several\nhypotheses for PIN protein evolution. We postulate that PIN proteins\noriginated in streptophyte algae, but note that their function in these\norganisms remains unknown. We further propose that the initial\nsubcellular localization of PIN proteins was presumably at the\nendoplasmic reticulum and that plasma membrane localization was acquired\nduring land plant evolution. We also suggest that the PIN proteins are\nevolutionarily distinct from another family of auxin transporters at the\nER, the PIN-LIKES (PILS) proteins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr56113","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_56113.phy"}]}
