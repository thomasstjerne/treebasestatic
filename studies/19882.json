The ants\nreceive shelter and food from the hostplant, and in return they\naggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants.\nConsiderable attention has focused on the ecology and behavior of these\nants, but the evolutionary history of the group has received less\nscrutiny. Using ultraconserved element (UCE) sequence capture and\ncomprehensive taxon sampling, we analyze phylogeny, biogeography, and\ntrait evolution in the ferrugineus group. Results confirm the existence\nof two separate lineages of obligate acacia-ants that convergently\nevolved protective behavior, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs\nin rainforest. The older and more diverse of the two clades (eight\nextant species) is inferred to have arisen in the late Miocene in\nnorthern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout\nmuch of Mexico and Central America. The other lineage (two species) is\nestimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 2.5 Mya,\napparently piggy-backing on an existing mutualism. The initiation of the\nPseudomyrmex/Vachellia mutualism was associated with a shift in the ants\nfrom closed to open habitats, likely an environment with more intense\nplant herbivory.","trees":[{"tree_label":"raxml 1672 part bygene","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98567.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml 1672 no part","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98566","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98566.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml 1672 ry coding","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98568.phy"},{"tree_label":"astral v4108 best500 loci","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98569.phy"},{"tree_label":"beast","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98570","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98570.phy"},{"tree_label":"beast","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98571","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98571.phy"},{"tree_label":"beast","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98572","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98572.phy"},{"tree_label":"astral","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98573","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98573.phy"},{"tree_label":"astral","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98574","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98574.phy"}]}
