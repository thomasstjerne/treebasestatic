Although comprehensive taxonomic treatments exist for\nlocal floras, a picture of the evolutionary relationships for the genus\nas a whole, gained from molecular data, is still missing. More\nspecifically, the question is whether different ancestral Oxytropis\nspecies separately colonized the North American Arctic, as suggested by\ntaxonomy. To answer this question, we sequenced the nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from 16 Oxytropis specimens,\nincluding four species that were used in a previous transcriptome study.\nIn addition, 81 other Oxytropis ITS sequences were retrieved from public\nsequence databases and included in the analysis, and the dataset was\nanalyzed using phylogenetic trees and statistical parsimony networks.\nResults show that all Oxytropis ITS sequences are very similar.\nFurthermore, at least six lineages evolved from different temperate\nancestors to colonize the North American Arctic. This pattern is\nbelieved to be typical of the arctic flora. Additionally, the sequence\nrelationships analyses confirm that the Phacoxytropis may be ancestral\nin Oxytropis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxytropis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49788.phy"}]}
