There is good support from analyses of\nvarious molecular data for the clade itself, but relationships of genera\nwithin the clade are not fully understood nor has the monophyly of the\ntribes and genera been fully tested. Sequences of the plastid gene matK\nfrom 84 members of the vicioid clade were analyzed using maximum\nparsimony. Results presented here provide strong support for a\nmonophyletic Vicieae that includes Vicia, Lathyrus, Pisum, and Lens.\nVicia is paraphyletic with regard to other genera of Vicieae, but there\nis some support for monophyletic groups of species of Vicia. Pisum is\nsister to a monophyletic Lathyrus, and Lens is sister to a small group\nof species of Vicia. A monophyletic Trifolium is sister to the Vicieae,\nand together they form a moderately supported monophyletic group.\nSimilarly, a monophyletic Ononis is sister to genera of tribe Trifolieae\nincluding Medicago, Trigonella, and Melilotus. Medicago is monophyletic\nand includes the previously transferred species from Trigonella.\nMedicago and Trigonella are sister taxa, but Melilotus is nested within\nTrigonella. Morphological and biochemical features are considered as\nthey support particular groups within the vicioid clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vicioid clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4439.phy"}]}
