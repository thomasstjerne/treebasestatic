The recognition of the group was based upon the\nshared possession of unbranched fertile culms, the presence of a\ndistinct abscission line at the base of the leaf sheaths, and anthers\nthat are included at anthesis. The taxonomy of the group has been\nproblematic, and every monographer of the group used different generic\ndelimitations. Based upon a cladistic analysis of sequence data from\nmultiple chloroplast markers (trnL-F region, atpB-rbcL\nspacer, trnK intron, matK, and rbcL) for all 60\nspecies, we seek optimal generic groupings that are monophyletic,\nconservative nomenclaturally, and readily diagnosable using\nmorphological characters. We find no support for the monophyly of the\nElegia group, as the genus Askidiosperma, itself forming a\nclade of 12 species, falls outside the group. Within the remaining\nelements we find no acceptable generic groupings, consequently we\npropose an expanded circumscription of Elegia that includes the\ngenera Chondropetalum and Dovea, as these latter two\ngenera are embedded within the former. New combinations are E.\nacockii, E. aggregata, E. decipiens, E. ebracteata, E. hookeriana, E.\nmarlothii, E. microcarpa, E. recta, E. tectorum, E. macrocarpa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elegia group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2094.phy"}]}
