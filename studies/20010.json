SEMIA3007 was analyzed within the Mesorhizobium groups\nto define the underlying causes of taxonomic identification. We\npreviously used biochemical tests and phenotypic taxonomic methods to\nidentify bacteria, which can lead to erroneous classification. An\nimproved understanding of bacterial strains such as the Mesorhizobium\ngenus would increase our knowledge of classification and evolution of\nthese species. Results: In this study, we sequenced the complete genome\nof SEMIA3007 and compared it with five other Mesorhizobium and two\nRhizobium genomes. The genomes of isolated SEMIA3007 showed several\northologs with M. huakuii, M. erdmanii and M. loti. We identified\nSEMIA3007 as a Mesorhizobium by comparing the 16S rRNA gene and the\ncomplete genome. Conclusion: Our ortholog, 16S rRNA gene and average\nnucleotide identity values (ANI) analysis all demonstrate SEMIA3007 is\nnot Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae. The results of the phylogenetic\nanalysis clearly show SEMIA3007 is part of the Mesorhizobium group and\nsuggest a reclassification is warranted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesorhizobium 8 16S tds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101150.phy"}]}
