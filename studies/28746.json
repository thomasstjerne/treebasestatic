We included all\nNeotropical genera and brought together other sampled genera found in\nthe literature. Based on our results from different phylogenetic\nanalyses using sequences of nuclear (18S rDNA, nrITS) and mitochondrial\n(cox3 and matR) markers, we recognise three clades, “Sarcophytoideae”,\n“Scybalioideae”, and “Balanophoroideae”, and suggest diagnostic\ncharacter states for each of them. The infrafamilial classification\nadopted here agrees with the Englerian classification system in\nrecognising three subfamilies for Balanophoraceae s.s. In\nSarcophytoideae, the positioning of Sarcophyte suggests that it could be\nthe early divergent lineage of the family. In Balanophoroideae, we\nconfirm that Langsdorffia malagasica should be treated in the genus\nThonningia, as originally described, which suggests Langsdorffia as an\nexclusively Neotropical genus. Additionally, according to the Englerian\nclassification system, we recognise more taxonomic categories in\nScybalioideae, considering three tribes: Helosieae (Corynaea and\nHelosis), Lophophyteae (Lophophytum and Ombrophytum), and Scybalieae\n(Scybalium). Finally, we confirm the affinities and propose a new\ncombination of Lathrophytum peckoltii to the genus Ombrophytum, reducing\nthe monospecific Lathrophytum to a synonym. Based on the obtained\nresults, the family system and an updated identification key to the\nsubfamilies and tribes are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133461","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133461.phy"}]}
