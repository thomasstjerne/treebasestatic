In this study, we\nuse two nuclear and 10 plastid loci to infer phylogenetic relationships\namong all nine families of Rosales. Rosales were strongly supported as\nmonophyletic; within Rosales all family relationships are well-supported\nwith Rosaceae sister to all other members of the order. Remaining\nRosales can be divided into two subclades: 1) Ulmaceae are sister to\nCannabaceae plus (Urticaceae + Moraceae); 2). Rhamnaceae are sister to\nElaeagnaceae plus (Barbeyaceae + Dirachmaceae). One noteworthy result is\nthat we recover the first strong support for a sister relationship\nbetween the enigmatic Dirachmaceae and Barbeyaceae. These two small,\nenigmatic families have distinct morphologies and potential\nsynapomorphies remain unclear. Future studies should try to identify\nnonDNA synapomorphies uniting Barbeyaceae with Dirachmaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rep.600","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57839","tree_kind":"Species
