Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data\nfrom plastid rpl16 and ndhF, indicate that both species do not belong to\nUrochloa, genus in which they were previously placed. Also,\nmorphological characters are analyzed in relation with Urochloa. Hence,\nRupichloa was established on the basis of morphological and molecular\ncharacters. Additionally, affinities of the new genus with other genera\nof the Paniceae are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6153.phy"},{"tree_label":"not printed (rpl16+gaps) parsimony","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6505.phy"},{"tree_label":"not printed (rpl16+ndhf) Bayesian","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6027.phy"},{"tree_label":"not printed (ndhf) parsimony","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6092.phy"}]}
