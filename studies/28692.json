Furthermore, P.\npiptadeniae has a narrower concept in its morphology and distribution,\nand both P. neoaridus and P. teixeirae present a distribution range\nrestricted to seasonally dry tropical forests in South America.\nAdditionally, based on detailed morphological revisions, Phellinus\nbadius, Phellinus resinaceus and Phellinus scaber are transferred to\nPhellinotus. The geographic distribution and host range of the genus are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133000","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133000.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133001","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133001.phy"}]}
