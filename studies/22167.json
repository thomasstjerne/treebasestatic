The degree to which HGT can lead to evolutionary\nnovelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity through the\nsedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we identify their\nmajor constituent protein, OCTIN. Phylogenetic analysis strongly\nsupports acquisition of octin by HGT from bacteria to the common\nancestor of the Mucorales. A bacterial OCTIN forms high-order oligomers\nin the periplasm and disulphide bonds underlie the stability of both\ncrystals and bacterial oligomers, suggesting that they share elements of\na conserved assembly mechanism. However, estimated sedimentation\nvelocities of bacterial OCTIN oligomers preclude any speculated role in\nbacterial gravity sensing. Together, out data suggest that HGT into the\nMucorales allowed a dramatic increase in assembly scale and acquisition\nof the gravity sensing function. We conclude that HGT can lead to\nevolutionary novelties that emerge depending on the cellular context of\nprotein assembly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales OCTIN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111641.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales OCTIN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111642.phy"}]}
