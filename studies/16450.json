Poplar volatiles have been reported to function as signals\nin plant-insect interactions and intra- and inter-plant communication.\nAlthough the volatile blend is dominated by mono- and sesquiterpenes,\nthere is much to be learned about their formation in poplar.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr78096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78096.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr78094","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78094.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr78095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78095.phy"}]}
