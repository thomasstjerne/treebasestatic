An Arctic\nmarine bacterial strain collection was established consisting of 1448\nindividual isolates originating from biota, water and sediment samples\ntaken at a various depth in the Barents Sea, North of mainland Norway,\nwith an all year round seawater temperature of 4 °C. The entire\ncollection was subjected to high-throughput screening for detection of\nextracellular laccase activity with guaiacol as a substrate.In total, 13\nlaccase positive isolates were found, all belonging to the Psychrobacter\ngenus. From the most diverse four strains based on 16S rRNA gene\nsequence analysis, all originating from the same Botryllus sp. colonial\nascidian tunicate sample, genomic DNA was isolated and genome sequenced\nusing a combined approach of whole genome shotgun and 8 kb mate-pair\nlibrary sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The genomes were\nassembled and revealed genome sizes between 3.29 and 3.52 Mbp with an\naverage G+C content of around 42%, with one to seven plasmids present in\nthe four strains. Bioinformatics based genome mining was performed to\ndescribe the metabolic potential of these four strains and to identify\ngene candidates potentially responsible for the observed laccase\npositive phenotype. Up to two different laccase-like multicopper oxidase\n(LMCO) encoding gene candidates were identified in each of the four\nstrains. Heterologous expression of P11F6-LMCO and P11G5-LMCO2 in\nEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) resulted in recombinant proteins exhibiting\n2,2’-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) and\nguaiacol oxidizing activity. Thirteen Psychrobacter species with\nlaccase-positive phenotype were isolated from a collection of Arctic\nmarine bacteria. Four of the isolates were genome sequenced. The overall\ngenome features were similar to other publicly available Psychrobacter\ngenome sequences except for P11G5 harboring seven plasmids. However,\nthere were differences at the pathway level as genes associated with\ndegradation of phenolic compounds, nicotine, phenylalanine, styrene,\nethylbenzene, and ethanolamine were detected only in the Psychrobacter\nstrains reported in this study while they were absent among the other\npublicly available Psychrobacter genomes. In addition, six gene\ncandidates were identified by genome mining and shown to possess T1, T2\nand T3 copper binding sites as the main signature of the three-domain\nlaccases. P11F6-LMCO and P11G5-LMCO2 were recombinantly expressed and\nshown to be active when ABTS and guaiacol were used as substrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93995","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93995.phy"}]}
