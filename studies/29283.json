In this\nstudy, chemical composition and cytotoxicity of F. rugosa ethanolic\nextract were investigated for the first time. Five oxylipins were\nidentified by Ultra Hight Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to\nQuadrupole Time-of-Flight and Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The\nethanolic extract was weakly toxic to the tested cell lines, suggesting\nthat it can be tested for biological activities with relative\nselectivity and safety.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135191","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135191.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135192.phy"}]}
