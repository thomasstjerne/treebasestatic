The\nclarification of the phylogenetic position of Diopsina nested deeply\nwithin Diopsini is of crucial importance for the understanding of the\nrelationships and the evolution of various morphological characters\nwithin the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diopsina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7876.phy"}]}
