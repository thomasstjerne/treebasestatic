ITS1 and ITS2 sequences were successfully obtained\nfrom 19 Nectria sensu Saccardo types, representing 17 different species,\nand from Nectriella rufofusca type specimen; while for Nectria ambigua,\nN. radians and N. tjibodensis only the ITS1 was recovered. Our analyses\nsuggest that there is a need to introduce new nomenclatural combinations\nfor six species and new synonymies for seven species. For the remaining\neight species the current systematic position was confirmed. This is the\nfirst time that these over one century specimens are involved in a\nmolecular study providing new important DNA sequences from precious\nfungal type material.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126714.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bionectriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126715.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bionectriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126716.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusicolla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126717.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clonostachys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126718.phy"}]}
