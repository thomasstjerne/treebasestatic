As for\nmorphology, the misidentified species differs from A. pantherina by\nhaving clamp connection on hyphae and basidia, a larger-sized fruitbody,\nascending volval rings of stipe base and deciduous annulus. It is\ncleared that the misidentified species is a poisonous fungi containing\nibotenic acid and muscimol and causes the Pantherina Syndrome. On these\ncharacters, it is naturally concluded that the misidentified species is\nthe unexplored Amanita species treated under the Japanese name\nibotengutake after which ibotenic acid was named. Here, we described it\nas a new species Amanita ibotengutake.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita, 1/22 MP trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5779.phy"}]}
