Considering this fact, we sequenced the whole genome of\nhighly virulent Sarocladium oryzae field isolate, Saro-13 with 82x\ncoverage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr94871","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_94871.phy"}]}
