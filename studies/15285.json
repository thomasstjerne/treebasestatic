Phylogenetic species are supported by both a multi-locus\ntree-based method and Bayesian species delimitation. Lactifluus volemus\nand L. oedematopus are provided with a new description, and a third\nspecies, L. subvolemus, is described as new to science. Revealing that\nL. volemus  already considered extinct in the Netherlands and the\nBelgian Flemish region, and declining in other European countries  is\nactually a complex of three species that are even more vulnerable to\nextinction, this study emphasizes the fundamental role of taxonomy in\nspecies conservation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70251.phy"}]}
