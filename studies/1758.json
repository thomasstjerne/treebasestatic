The tree based on\ncombined data of gpd, ef and hsp showed that Japanese H. annosum s. l.\nwas close to the European S-group, forming subclade. The results of this\nstudy also provided strong support for the recognition of the\nundetermined Heterobasidion sp. as a distinct phylogenetic species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion GPD","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4788.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion HSP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4789.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4790.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4791.phy"}]}
