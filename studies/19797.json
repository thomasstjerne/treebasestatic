They do this by combining both extracorporeal and intracellular\ndigestion. Whereas many high throughput (“-omics”) techniques focus on\nbiomolecules in spider venom, so far this approach has not yet been\napplied to investigate the protein composition of spider midgut\ndiverticula (MD) and digestive fluid (DF).","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"243","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arachnida Astacins gene","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100269.phy"}]}
