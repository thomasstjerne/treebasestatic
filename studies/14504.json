This species was supported further by the analyses of the\nÎ²-tubulin, calmodulin and actin gene sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus huiyaniae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107323.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus huiyaniae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107324.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus huiyaniae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107325.phy"}]}
