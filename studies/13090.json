The holotype and paratype materials of A. bohetii are\nre-examined and found to have closer affinities with Brachiosaurus and\nrelatives than with any diplodocoid. The presence of a second\ntitanosauriform sauropod in the Tanzanian fauna is important for\nunderstanding the palaeoecology of the region. Comparisons between\nTendaguru and three other contemporaneous sauropod faunas (Morrison\nFormation, USA; Lourinhã and Alcobaça formations, Portugal; Cañadón\nCalcáreo, Argentina) are also made. The revised Tendaguru fauna, with\nits high diversity of high-browsing Macronarians, now more closely\nmatches the conifer-forest dominated landscape inferred from\npalaeobotanical evidence. The Morrison Formation, dominated by\nlow-browse, is once again the only formation containing multiple\ndiplodocids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sauropoda results","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55429.phy"}]}
