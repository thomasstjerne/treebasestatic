(Apocynaceae-Ceropegieae-Stapeliinae):\nparaphyletic but still taxonomically sound","Journal":" Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Even though the species-rich genus Ceropegia is\nconvincingly characterized by its pitfall flowers, investigation of\nnon-coding markers of cpDNA (trnT-L and trnL-F spacers, and the trnL\nintron) and nrDNA (ITS) has shown that Ceropegia is twice paraphyletic.\nThe 36 analyzed Ceropegia taxa are scattered over a grade of seven\nclades. One clade is shared by some Ceropegia and all Brachystelma\nspecies investigated, making Ceropegia (without Brachystelma)\nparaphyletic. All endemic Madagascan Ceropegia taxa investigated and the\nEast African C. robynsiana share a terminal, but in most analyses\nunresolved clade with the stapeliads. Thus, again, Ceropegia without the\nstapeliads, is paraphyletic. These results are incongruent with current\ntaxonomy. In absence of adequate morphological, anatomical or\nkaryological characters supporting a taxonomical reclassification of the\ngenus in accordance to the retrieved clades of the phylogenetic\nanalysis, it is proposed to classify Ceropegia as a \u001amorphogenus\u001a and to\nhold on to the current taxonomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpDNA tree","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceropegia, cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2660.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceropegia, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2661.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceropegia, cpDNA ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2662.phy"}]}
