Classicula fluitans forms transversly septate\nbasidia with subapically swollen sterigmata and long-fusiform\nbasidiospores. An integrated analysis of morphological, ultrastructural,\nand molecular data indicates that Classicula fluitans is a member of the\nUrediniomycetes. Among the Urediniomycetes, Classicula fluitans shares\nthe formation of simple septal pores associated with microbodies and\ntremelloid haustorial cells only with the hyphomycet Jaculispora\nsubmersa. In addition, in our molecular phylogenetic analyses with at\nleast two representatives of all known Urediniomycetous groups\nClassicula fluitans appears together with Jaculispora submersa in a\nstatistically well supported cluster. Accordingly, the family\nClassiculaceae and the order Classiculales are proposed to accommodate\nthese fungi in the Urediniomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Classicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_842.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Classicula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_843.phy"}]}
