The\nfungus is considered as a new species, namely, Setoidium castanopsidis\nsp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS rDNA regions showed that S.\ncastanopsidis formed a distinct lineage separated from Cy. tjibodensis,\nCy. lanestris, and Cy. wrightii. Setoidium castanopsidis also differs\nmorphologically from Cy. tjibodensis in having distinct appressoria\n(nipple-shaped), longer conidiophores with longer foot-cells, larger\nconidia, and being found on Ca. javanica. The teleomorphic state has not\nbeen found during the collection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Setoidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56416.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Setoidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56386.phy"}]}
