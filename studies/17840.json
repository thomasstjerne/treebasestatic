Among\nthese, S. emersum comprises two infraspecific taxa, subspecies acaule\nfrom eastern North America and subspecies emersum from Eurasia and\nwestern North America (and occasionally from eastern North America as\nwell). However, there has been some discussion regarding the monophyly\nof S. emersum sensu lato. We tested the hypothesis of a polyphyletic S.\nemersum sensu lato in a phylogenetic framework. Sequence data from six\nplastid DNA regions and nuclear phyC were analyzed using maximum\nparsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. We obtained a\nmoderately resolved phylogeny with the plastid DNA data set, while\nphylogenetically less-informative phyC was useful to distinguish\nmorphological species and discern hybrid and non-hybrid specimens.\nSparganium emersum sensu lato was resolved as polyphyletic, clustering\nwith S. angustifolium and S. glomeratum, respectively. Sparganium acaule\nis resurrected to be a sister to S. glomeratum, for which synapomorphic\nand distinguishing morphological characters are provided. Three cases of\nhybridization were detected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium ptDNA RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88675.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium PhyC RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88676.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium phyC Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88698.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium ptDNA Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88696.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium ptDNA Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88697.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium phyC Bayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88699.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium ptDNA MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium PhyC MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88687.phy"}]}
