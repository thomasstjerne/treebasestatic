Some species are associated with rust fungi and\nother plant pathogenic fungi and play an important role in biological\ncontrol. In this current work, two specimens of Simplicillium were\ncollected from Chiang Mai, Thailand. Simplicillium formicae sp. nov. was\ncollected from an infected ant and S. lanosoniveum from Ophiocordyceps\nunilateralis and is a new host record. Species were initially identified\nusing ITS gene sequences and confirmed using phylogenies from analyses\nof a combined nrLSU, nrSSU, tef-1a and rpb1 dataset and morphology.\nSimplicillium formicae differs from other species in the genus in\nproducing flask-shaped synnemata and special phialides with intercalary\nnodes. Simplicillium lanosoniveum resembles other collections of the\nspecies in its completely solitary, tapering phialides, globose to\nellipsoidal conidia which adhere in slimly head. A key to species of\nSimplicillium is provided to advance the understanding of interspecies\nrelationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Simplicillium BT-LSU SSU TEF RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117297.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Simplicillium ITS BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117296.phy"}]}
