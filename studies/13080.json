This species is rediagnosed\nbased on the unique combination of iliac central plate with depth/length\nratio less than 0.8 and sacral vertebrae with distally ‘clubbed’ neural\nspines at least four times higher than their centra. A maximum parsimony\nanalysis of 47 hadrosauroid (39 hadrosaurid) species does not support\nthe purported lambeosaurine affinities of B. sicinskii, but recovers\nthis form as a basal saurolophine hadrosaurid based on unambiguous\nsynapomorphies of the ilium. This result increases the diversity of\nsaurolophine taxa in Asia, a continent with a hadrosaurid fossil record\nso far dominated by lambeosaurines. Finally, several vertebral and iliac\ncharacters previously regarded as diagnostic of Lambeosaurinae are\ndiscussed and shown to be uninformative from a taxonomic or phylogenetic\nstandpoint.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ornithopoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55356.phy"}]}
