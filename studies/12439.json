We introduce a novel\ndistance, the Additive Dollo Distance (ADD), which is consistent for\ndata generated under a Dollo model, and show that it has some useful\ntheoretical properties including an intriguing link to the LogDet\ndistance. Simulations of Dollo data are used to compare a number of\nbinary distances including ADD, LogDet, Nei Li and some simple, but to\nour knowledge previously unstudied, variations on common binary\ndistances. The simulations suggest that ADD outperforms other distances\non Dollo data. Interestingly, we found that the LogDet distance performs\npoorly in the context of a Dollo process, which may have implications\nfor its use in connection with conditioned genome reconstruction. We\napply the ADD to two Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) datasets, one\nthat broadly covers Eucalyptus species and one that focuses on the\nEucalyptus series Adnataria. We also reanalyse gene family\npresence/absence data on bacteria from the COG database and compare the\nresults to previous phylogenies estimated using the conditioned genome\nreconstruction approach.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Adnataria PADD","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adnataria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51217.phy"},{"tree_label":"Eucalyptus PADD","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eucalyptus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51221.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adnataria ADD plus 500","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adnataria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51219.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adnataria ADD","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adnataria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51218.phy"},{"tree_label":"COG ADD","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COG Database Results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_51222.phy"}]}
