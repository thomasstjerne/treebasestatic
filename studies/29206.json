This paper describes formally\nGlobisporangium coniferarum sp. nov. as a new species and compares it\nwith other closely related known Globisporangium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135476","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135476.phy"}]}
