Much of the skeleton was damaged by colonies of\ndermestid coleopterans prior to its complete burial. However, diagnostic\ncharacters are recovered from the parts preserved, including the skull,\npartial forelimbs (including the left hand), legs, and distal portions\nof both feet. Nemegtomaia represents the fourth known genus of\noviraptorid for which individuals have been found on nests of eggs. The\nsecond new specimen, MPC-D 107/16, was collected a few kilometers to the\neast in basal deposits of the Nemegt Formation, and includes both hands\nand femora of a smaller Nemegtomaia individual. The two formations and\ntheir diverse fossil assemblages have been considered to represent\nsequential time periods and different environments, but data presented\nhere indicate partial overlap across the Baruungoyot-Nemegt transition.\nAll other known oviraptorids from Mongolia and China are known\nexclusively from xeric or semi-arid environments. However, this study\ndocuments that Nemegtomaia is found in both arid/aeolian (Baruungoyot\nFormation) and more humid/fluvial (Nemegt Formation) facies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Oviraptoridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55070.phy"}]}
