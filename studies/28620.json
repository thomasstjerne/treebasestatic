These were\nfurther evaluated based on morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic\nanalyses of a combined DNA data matrix containing SSU, LSU, ITS and\ntef1-α sequence data. The new species Rhytidhysteron xiaokongense is\nintroduced with its asexual morph, which are characterized by\nsemi-immersed, subglobose to ampulliform conidiomata, dark brown, oblong\nto ellipsoidal, 1-septate, conidia, which are granular in appearance\nwhen mature. In addition to the new species, two new records from\nThailand are reported viz. Rhytidhysteron tectonae on woody litter of\nBetula sp. (Betulaceae) and Fabaceae sp., Rhytidhysteron neorufulum on\nwoody litter of Tectona grandis (Lamiaceae). Morphological descriptions,\nillustrations, taxonomic notes and phylogenetic analyses are provided\nfor all entries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132691.phy"}]}
