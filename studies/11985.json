As a\nresult, groups of animals of recent arrival converged into similar\nhabits and formed ecological guilds with some of the endemics. We herein\npresent a reconstruction of the evolutionary events in Aspidoderidae, a\nfamily of nematodes that infect mammals that are part of this\ninterchange: dasypodids, opossums and sigmodontine, geomyid and\nhystricognath rodents. By treating hosts as discrete states of character\nand by using parsimony and Bayesian inferences to optimize these traits\ninto the phylogeny of Aspidoderidae we reconstructed Dasypodidae\n(armadillos) as the synapomorphic host for the family. In addition, four\nevents of host switching were detected. One consisted in the switch from\ndasypodids to hystricognath rodents, and subsequently to geomyid\nrodents. The remaining set of events consisted in a switch from\ndasypodids to didelphid marsupials and then to sigmodontine rodents. The\nreconstruction of ancestral distribution suggests three events of\nintrogression into the Nearctic. Two of these invasions would suggest\nthat two different lineages of parasites of dasypodids entered into the\nnorthern hemisphere at different times.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MORPHOLOGY","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48987.phy"},{"tree_label":"mrBayes20million","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony rLSU","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48984.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48981.phy"},{"tree_label":"mrBayes 20million","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48985.phy"},{"tree_label":"t2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48983.phy"},{"tree_label":"MORPH","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48991.phy"},{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspidoderidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48982.phy"}]}
