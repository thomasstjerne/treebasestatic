This new species is\ncharacterized by resupinate basidiocarps, a poroid hymenophore,\npseudodimitic hyphal system, nodose-septate hyphae, four types of\ncystidia (capitate, acicular to cylindrical, subulate to ventricose, and\napically-encrusted), and thin-walled, colorless, smooth and ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. Both Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony algorithms were used\nto construct phylogenies inferred from the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) region of rDNA. Morphological and molecular studies, along with\nintercompatibility tests, confirmed the independent status of this\nspecies. A key to known species of Hyphodontia s.l. with poroid,\nirpicoid or raduloid hymenophores is provided for the convenience in\nidentification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107723","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107723.phy"}]}
