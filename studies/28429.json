{"Authors":" Tongkai Zong","Year":" 2021","Title":" Absidia (Cunnighamellaceae, Mucorales) in China: nine new\nspecies and two new combinations","Journal":" Jounal of Fungi","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Mucoromycota; new species; new combination; taxonomy;\nmorphology; molecular phylogeny","DOI":"","Abstract":" In the present study, nine new species were described in\nthe genus Absidia, i.e.Â A. ampullacea, A. brunnea, A. chinensis, A.\ndigitata, A. oblongispora, A. odorata, A. sympodialis, A. varians, and\nA. virescens. Besides, two variants A. cylindrospora var. nigra and A.\nspinosa var. biappendiculata were elevated to a specific rank as A.\nnigra comb. nov. and A. biappendiculata comb. nov., respectively. These\nnew taxa were proposed based on a combination of morphological traits\n(such as shapes and sizes of sporangia, sporangiospores and projections\non columellae), physiological feature (maximum growth temperatures), and\nmulti-locus sequences (including internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA),\nD1-D2 domains of nuclear ribosomal DNA large subunit, partial\ntranslation elongation factor 1 alpha gene and actin gene. All species\nmentioned above are illustrated, and an identification key to all the\nknown species of Absidia in China is included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
