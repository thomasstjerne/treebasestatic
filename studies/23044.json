The present study\naimed to investigate which species of Colletotrichum are associated with\nanthracnose disease in pomegranate in the Northeast region of Brazil,\nusing multilocus phylogenetic analyzes and morpho-cultural\ncharacteristics. From these analyzes, three species belonging to the\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides complex were identified in this study.\nThis is the first report of C. theobromicola in pomegranate fruit in\nBrazil and C. siamense and C. fructicola in the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112819.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112820.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112821","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112821.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112822","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112822.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112823.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112824.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112826","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112826.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112827","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112827.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112828","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112828.phy"}]}
