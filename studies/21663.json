It is characterized by annual,\nresupinate and soft basidiocarps with sulphurous hymenophores when fresh\nand olivaceous buff to honey-yellow when dry, a monomitic hyphal system,\nsimple septate generative hyphae, the presence of hyphoid cystidia and\nsubulate cystidioles, and subglobose to globose basidiospores with a\nguttule. Molecular phylogeny inferred from ITS and LSU sequences data\nstrongly supported P. sulphureus as a distinctive species belonging to\nPhysisporinus. The new species is described and illustrated in this\npaper","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physisporinus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110257.phy"}]}
