Here we show that structural\nhabitats contribute to differential diversification of limb and body\nform in dragon lizards (Agamidae). Based on phylogenetic analysis and\nancestral state reconstructions for 90 species, we find that multiple\nlineages have independently adopted each of four habitat use types:\nrock-dwelling, terrestriality, semi-arboreality, and arboreality. Given\nthese reconstructions, we fit models of evolution to species\nmorphological trait values and find that rock-dwelling and arboreality\nlimit diversification relative to terrestriality and semi-arboreality.\nModels preferred by AIC infer slower rates of size and shape evolution\nin lineages inferred to occupy rocks and trees, and model-averaged rate\nestimates are slowest for these habitat types. These results suggest\nthat ground-dwelling facilitates ecomorphological differentiation and\nthat use of trees or rocks impedes diversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agamidae, MCC Tree Topology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6918.phy"}]}
