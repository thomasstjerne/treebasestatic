Here we present a species-level molecular\nphylogeny based on a multilocus dataset for the Andean hummingbird genus\nCoeligena. We compare this phylogeny to previous hypotheses of\nevolutionary relationships and use it as a framework to understand\npatterns in the evolution of sexual dichromatism and in the biogeography\nof speciation within the Andes. Previous phylogenetic hypotheses based\nmostly on similarities in coloration conflicted with our molecular\nphylogeny, emphasizing the unreliability of color characters for\nphylogenetic inference. Two major clades, one monochromatic and the\nother dichromatic, were found in Coeligena. Closely related species were\neither allopatric or parapatric on opposite mountain slopes. No sister\nlineages replaced each other along an elevational gradient. Our results\nindicate the importance of geographic isolation for speciation in this\ngroup and the potential interaction between isolation and sexual\nselection to promote diversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coeligena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6192.phy"}]}
