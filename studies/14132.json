However,\nmolecular age estimates using only one or a few (often misapplied)\nfossil calibration points have produced a diversity of conflicting ages\nfor important evolutionary events within this clade. I here identify 16\nfossil calibration points of relevance to the phylogeny of Bovidae and\nRuminantia and use these, individually and together, to construct a\ndated molecular phylogeny through a reanalysis of the full mitochondrial\ngenome of over 100 ruminant species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"HippotraginiCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62763","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62763.phy"},{"tree_label":"CervidaeStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62772","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62772.phy"},{"tree_label":"BovidaeCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62767","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62767.phy"},{"tree_label":"RedunciniCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62765","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62765.phy"},{"tree_label":"StartingTreeFB","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bovidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62759.phy"},{"tree_label":"CapriniStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bovidae CapriniStem","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62760.phy"},{"tree_label":"KobusEllLeCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bovidae Kobus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62761.phy"},{"tree_label":"MoschidaeStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62762","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62762.phy"},{"tree_label":"All16Calibs","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bovidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62775.phy"},{"tree_label":"AlcelaphiniCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62776","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62776.phy"},{"tree_label":"TpEuryStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62774","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62774.phy"},{"tree_label":"BoviniCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62773","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62773.phy"},{"tree_label":"TragelaphiniCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62771","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62771.phy"},{"tree_label":"TpStrepStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62770","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62770.phy"},{"tree_label":"NoPriors RandomStarting","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bovidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63192.phy"},{"tree_label":"AlcBuselCrown","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62769","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62769.phy"},{"tree_label":"BoviniStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62768","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62768.phy"},{"tree_label":"HippotraginiStem","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62766","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62766.phy"},{"tree_label":"ConnochaetesCrow","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62764","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62764.phy"}]}
