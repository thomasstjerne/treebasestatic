While these models have proved useful\nin a variety of contexts, they still do not cover all the scenarios\nbiologists want to examine. For models based on the OU process, model\ncomplexity is restricted in current implementations by assuming that the\nrate of stochastic motion and the strength of selection do not vary\namong selective regimes. Here we expand the OU model of adaptive\nevolution to include models that variously relax the assumption of a\nconstant rate and strength of selection. In its most general form, the\nmethods described here can assign each selective regime a separate trait\noptimum, a rate of stochastic motion parameter, and a parameter for the\nstrength of selection. We use simulations to show that our models can\ndetect meaningful differences in the evolutionary process, especially\nwith larger sample sizes. We also illustrate our method using an\nempirical example of genome size evolution within a large flowering\nplant clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"590","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51070.phy"}]}
