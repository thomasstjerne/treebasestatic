The new phylogeny suggested that typical bird flight (powered\nby the front limbs only) either evolved at least twice, or was lost/\nmodified in some deinonychosaurs. However, this parsimony-based result\nwas acknowledged to be weakly supported. Maximum-likelihood and related\nBayesian methods applied to the same dataset yield a different and more\northodox result: Archaeopteryx is restored as a basal bird with\nbootstrap frequency of 73 per cent and posterior probability of 1. These\nresults are consistent with a single origin of typical\n(forelimb-powered) bird flight. The Archaeopteryxdeinonychosaur clade\nretrieved by parsimony is supported by more characters (which are on\naverage more homoplasious), whereas the Archaeopteryxbird clade\nretrieved by likelihood-based methods is supported by fewer characters\n(but on average less homoplasious). Both positions for Archaeopteryx\nremain plausible, highlighting the hazy boundary between birds and\nadvanced theropods. These results also suggest that likelihood-based\nmethods (in addition to parsimony) can be useful in morphological\nphylogenetics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaeopteryx","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55148.phy"}]}
