Several Mycosphaerella\nspecies and related anamorphs also represent potentially serious foliar\npathogens of Eucalyptus. The microfungi treated in the present study\nwere isolated from symptomatic Eucalyptus leaves collected in Thailand\nduring June-October 2007. Species were initially identified based on\nmorphological and cultural characteristics. Identifications were\nconfirmed using comparisons of DNA sequence data of the internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS1, 5.8S nrDNA, ITS2) and the 28S nrDNA (LSU)\nregions. To help distinguish species of Pseudocercospora, the dataset\nwas expanded by generating partial sequences of the translation\nelongation factor 1-Î± and actin genes. By integrating the morphological\nand molecular datasets, five new taxa are distinguished, namely\nMycosphaerella pseudomarksii, M. irregularis, M. quasiparkii,\nPseudocercospora chiangmaiensis and Penidiella eucalypti. New records\nfor Thailand include M. vietnamensis and M. heimii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella on Eucalyptus, 1 of 2 MPT, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6049.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella on Eucalyptus, MPT from ITS, TEF and\nACT.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella on Eucalyptus, 1 of 1,100 MPT, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6408.phy"}]}
