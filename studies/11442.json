The\nsection is distinguished principally by its papillate abaxial leaflet\nsurface, and the petals saccate at base and villous adaxially. The\nrather widespread edaphic generalist P. ferrugineum shares a common\nancestor with two small clades, one containing two white-sand\nspecialists (P. reticulatum and P. alvarezianum) that appear to have\ndiverged from a common ancestor allopatrically via fragmentation of\nwhite-sand habitats, and the other exhibiting degrees of edaphic\nspecialization among variants of P. subserratum. This scenario\nhighlights the role of edaphic heterogeneity as a driver in the\ndiversification of the Amazon flora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Papilloprotium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43822.phy"}]}
