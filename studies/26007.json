It occurs on Rhododendron species and is distributed across\nEurope, India and North America. The genus was previously established to\nepitypify Cucurbitaria rhododendri, referring to its alpine habitat, and\nwas assigned to Melanommataceae based on multigene phylogenetic\nanalysis. In this study, a fungal taxon growing on unidentified\ndicotyledonous wood was collected from Shangri La, Yunnan Province,\nChina. Our taxon clustered with Alpinaria in the combined LSU, SSU, ITS\nand TEF1-α phylogenetic tree, constructed based on maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian analyses. Our collection is characterized by globose,\nostiolate ascomata, septate pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical, bitunicate,\nfissitunicate asci and 8-spored, ellipsoid and septate ascospores.\nMorphology and phylogenetic analyses support the identification of our\ntaxon as A. rhododendri, a new record for China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122708","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122708.phy"}]}
