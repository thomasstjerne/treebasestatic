To test the monophyly of\ngenera and species in the order, we used a single-cell approach to\ngenerate nuclear 18S rRNA (18S) sequences for 10 isolates representing\nnine taxa. We provide the first sequences for the genus Zoopage and\nadditional sequences for taxa in Cocholonema, Acaulopage, and Zoophagus.\nOur results reveal that Zoophagus, Zoopage, and Acaulopage tetraceros\nare not monophyletic. We conclude that morphology alone is not\nsufficient to delineate genera and species in the order and encourage\nstudies that increase genetic sampling of taxa including type\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoopagales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118266.phy"}]}
