We examined this hypothesis using a phylogenetic analysis of\nnew and reevaluated characters polarizabled with outgroup comparison.\nOur cladistic analysis of basal angiosperms placed the nonmagnolialean\nChloranthaceae and Piperaceae at the bottom of the tree. We further\ninferred the probable ancestral states of characters not polarizable\nwith outgroup comparison by examining their distribution among taxa at\nthe base of our cladogram. The sum of ancestral character states\nsuggests that the protoangiosperm was a diminutive, rhizomatous to\nscrambling perennial herb, with small, simple flowers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_275.phy"}]}
