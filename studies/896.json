An integrated analysis of morphological,\nultrastructural, physiological, and molecular data indicates that the\nnew taxa belong to the Tremellales (Basidiomycota). Relevant\ncharacteristics of the new genera and species are discussed and compared\nwith those of closely related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 36","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New Tremellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5727.phy"}]}
