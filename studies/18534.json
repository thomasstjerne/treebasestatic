Each new taxon is morphologically unique. Coemansia\nbiformis sp. nov. has two different asexual reproductive types on the\nsame thallus, with one has spiral fertile portion. Coemansia helicoidea\nsp. nov. has stoloniferous sporangiophores with a helicoid fertile\nregion. Coemansia pennisetoides sp. nov. has a sporangiophore with a\nfertile region that resembles the inflorescence of the plant genus\nPennnisetum. Coemansia umbellata sp. nov. has an umbellate\nsporangiophore branching pattern and a spirally twisted fertile region\non the lowest branches. Phylogenetic analysis based on a combined\ndataset of D1-D2 domains of nuc 28S ribosomal RNA (rDNA) and partial nuc\n18S rDNA identifies several independent evolutionary lineages within\nCoemansia and suggests that Spirodactylon aureum and Kickxella\nalabastrina may be nested within the genus Coemansia. Sequences of nuc\nrDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) are also used to support the\ndescription of these new species of Coemansia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coemansia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101312.phy"}]}
