Combined analyses of\nITS, SSU and LSU sequence data obtained from the cultures derived from\nsingle spore isolates indicated that our new species belongs to\nNodulosphaeria with a close affinity to N. multiseptata and N.\nguttulatum. We therefore introduce Nodulosphaeria campanulae-trachelii\nas a new species with description and illustrations are provided and\ncompared it with similar taxa in Nodulosphaeria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110155.phy"}]}
