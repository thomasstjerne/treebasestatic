A trace of a columella on dehiscence of the\nsporangium and a dichotomously branched rhizoid are distinguishing\ncharacteristics of this species compared with M. rostafinskii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135797.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135799.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135800.phy"}]}
