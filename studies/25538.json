During a survey of\nfungal pathogens associated with blueberries in China, one hundred\nblighted, cankered or dead blueberry branches were collected from\nFujian, Shandong and Yunnan province, of which, ten botryosphaeriaceous\nisolates were obtained. Based on morphological characterization and\nphylogenetic analyses of the ITS rDNA, tef1-α, TUB, RPB2 gene, five\nLasiodiplodia taxa, viz. Lasiodiplodia clavispora, L. fujianensis, L.\nhenanica, L. nanpingensis and L. paraphysoides were recognized. All\nthese five species were identified as new to science. Detailed\ndescriptions and illustrations are provided for all of them.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121788.phy"}]}
