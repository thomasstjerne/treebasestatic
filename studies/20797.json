Its macromorphological\ncharacters are similar to species belonging to the subsection Nivei of\nCoprinus s.l. However, Coprinopsis rugosomagnispora has unique\nmicromorphological characters: very large, ornamented spores, voluminous\nbasidia and cystidia, and smooth veil elements. The large spores and\npattern of spore ornamentation (densely pitted) make this species unique\nwithin all coprinoid species described so far. The structure\n(arrangement and shape) of veil elements in C. rugosomagnispora is\nintermediate between members of the subsections Nivei and Lanatuli of\nCoprinus s.l. Molecular phylogenetic analyses, based on single-locus\n(ITS) Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian evolutionary trees recovered\nCoprinopsis rugosomagnispora within a lineage containing species having\nmorphological characters of the subsection Lanatuli (though within the\nso called Atramentarii clade) that contradicts its morphological\nsimilarity to members of the subsection Nivei.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coprinopsis rugosomagnispora ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_102932.phy"}]}
