The phylogenies obtained from the three genes were\ncongruent and allowed differentiation of three lineages of endophytes\nthat also presented morphological differences. One lineage corresponds\nto the previously described species EpichloeÂ¨ tembladerae, which is\npresent in a wide range of native grasses from Argentina including B.\nsetifolius and P. alpinum. Another genotype isolated only from B.\nsetifolius is a non-hybrid endophyte, a rare condition for the South\nAmerican EpichloeÂ¨ endophytes. Isolates of this genotype, described\nherein as a new variety, EpichloeÂ¨typhina var. aonikenkana, presented\nwaxy colonies at maturity and a low production of conidia. The third\nlineage, exclusively found in isolates from P. alpinum,is a hybrid\nbetween E. typhina and a common ancestor of E. amarillans and E.\nbaconii. Isolates of this lineage produce abundant conidia that are\nvariable in shape and size. Based on its unique phylogenetic position\nand morphology, we propose the new species, EpichloeÂ¨ cabralii for this\nlineage. The new combinations EpichloeÂ¨ tembladerae and E. pampeana\nalso are proposed for the previously described Neotyphodium tembladerae\nand Neotyphodium pampeanum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloë TubB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64104.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloë calM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloë tefA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75522.phy"}]}
