To understand the relationships of its members,\nwe obtained chloroplast atpB-rbcL sequences from 86 species of\nBalsaminaceae and five outgroups. Phylogenetic reconstructions using\nparsimony and Bayesian approaches provide a well-resolved phylogeny in\nwhich the sistergroup relationship between Impatiens and Hydrocera is\nconfirmed. The overall topology of Impatiens is strongly supported and\nis geographically structured. Impatiens likely originated in South China\nfrom where it colonized the adjacent regions and afterwards dispersed\ninto North America, Africa, India, the Southeast Asian peninsula and the\nHimalayan region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsaminaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4577.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsaminaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4578.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsaminaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Balsaminaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4580.phy"}]}
