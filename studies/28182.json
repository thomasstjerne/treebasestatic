It is\ncharacterized by having small to medium-sized basidiomata; a yellow to\nyellowish pale pileus covering pyramidal to subconical, white to yellow\nwhite volval remnants; globose stipe base covered conical, white to\nyellow white volval remnants; fugacious subapical annulus; and absent\nclamps. Multi-gene phylogenetic analyses based on partial nuclear rDNA\ninternal transcribed spacer region (ITS), partial nuclear rDNA larger\nsubunit region (nrLSU), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2),\npartial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1- Î±) and beta-tubulin\ngene (TUB) indicated that A. submelleialba formed as a distinct lineage\nfrom other extant species in section Amanita. The detailed morphological\ncharacteristics, line-drawing illustration and comparisons with\nmorphologically similar taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FIG. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RAxML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130906.phy"}]}
