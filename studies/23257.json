Based on DNA\ndata for five loci (ITS, LSU, rpb2, tub2 and tef1), Seimatosporium is\nshown to be paraphyletic. The ex-type species of Allelochaeta,\nDiscostromopsis and Vermisporium represent a distinct sister clade to\nwhich the oldest name Allelochaeta is applied. These genera were\ntraditionally separated based on a combination of conidial pigmentation,\nseptation, and the nature of their conidial appendages. Allelochaeta is\nrevealed to include taxa with both branched or solitary appendages, that\ncould be cellular or continuous, with conidia being (2)3(5)-septate,\nhyaline, or pigmented, concolourous or versicolourous. This suggests\nthat these characters should be applied at species, and not at the\ngeneric level. Conidial pigmentation appears to have been lost or gained\nseveral times during the evolution of species within Allelochaeta. In\ntotal, 25 new species, 15 new combinations, and 10 new epitypifications\nare proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian combined","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium ITS LSU rpb2 tef1 and tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium ITS LSU rpb2 tef1 and tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114166.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114168.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpb2","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114170.phy"},{"tree_label":"tef1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114171.phy"},{"tree_label":"tub2","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114172.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vermisporium LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114169.phy"}]}
