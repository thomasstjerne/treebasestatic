Both have unusual ramified bodies with one head and multiple\nbranches and live inside the canals of host sponges. Using an\nintegrative approach (combining morphology, internal anatomy, ecology,\nphylogeny, genetic divergence, and the complete mitochondrial genome),\nwe describe a new branching species from Japan, Ramisyl- lis\nkingghidorahi n. sp., inhabiting an undescribed species of Petrosia\n(Porifera: Demospongiae) from shallow waters. We compare the new species\nwith its closest relative, R. multicaudata; emend the diagnosis of\nRamisyllis; and discuss on the previous reports of S. ramosa. This study\nsuggests a much higher diversity of branching syllids than currently\nknown. Finally, we discuss possible explanations for the feeding\nbehaviour in the new species in relation to its highly ciliated wall of\nthe digestive tubes (especially at the distal branches and anus), and\nprovide a hypothesis for the evolution of branching body patterns as the\nresult of an adaptation to the host sponge labyrinthic canal\nsystem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"16S ML tree","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135724.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S ML tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"18S ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135725.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI ML tree","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"COI ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135726.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S ML tree","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"28S ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135716.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree - concatenated matrix","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree - concatenated matrix","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135727.phy"}]}
