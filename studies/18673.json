{"Authors":" Daniel Ardisson-Araujo, Fernando Lucas Melo","Year":" 2015","Title":" A betabaculovirus encoding a gp64 homolog","Journal":" BMC Genomics","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" baculovirus, gp64, complete genome,","DOI":"","Abstract":" The complete genome sequence of DisaGV was determined\nusing the 454-pyrosequencing method. The genome was 98,404 bp long,\nwhich makes it the smallest lepidopteran-infecting baculovirus sequenced\nto date. It had a G+C content of 29.7% encoding 125 putative open\nreading frames (ORF). All the 37 baculovirus core genes and a set of 19\nbetabaculovirus-specific genes were found. A group of 13 putative genes\nwas not found in any other baculovirus genome sequenced so far. A\nphylogenetic analysis indicated that DisaGV is a member of\nBetabaculovirus genus and that it is a sister group to a cluster formed\nby ChocGV, ErelGV, PiraGV isolates, ClanGV, CaLGV, CpGV, CrleGV AdorGV,\nPhopGV and EpapGV. Surprisingly, we found in the DisaGV genome a G\nprotein-coupled receptor related to lepidopteran and other insect virus\ngenes and a gp64 homolog, which is likely a product of horizontal gene\ntransfer from Group 1 alphabaculoviruses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betabaculovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93094.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betabaculovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93093.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betabaculovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93092.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betabaculovirus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93095.phy"}]}
