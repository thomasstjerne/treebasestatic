This fungus is characterized by dark brown\nimmersed or partially erumpent ascomata with long necks and fusiform to\nobovoid asci each with an acute or long tapering stipe. Each ascus bears\neight fusiform to filiform ascospores. Phylogenetic analyses based on\nthe markers LSU, rpb2, and tef-1Î± indicated that this is a new monotypic\ngenus in the Gnomoniaceae (Diaporthales). We thus propose Tenuignomonia\nstyracis gen. et sp. nov. Members of the Gnomoniaceae are commonly\nisolated as endophytes, saprobes, and plant pathogens from a broad\ndiversity of herbaceous, shade tree, and agriculturally significant\nplants. We thus carried out a pathogenicity test to determine if T.\nstyracis is the causative agent of leaf blotch on S. obassia. One week\nafter inoculation, this fungus produced small necrotic spots on the\nleaves and petioles, and all leaves having necrotic spots were abscised\nin a short time. We thus confirmed that this fungus has weak\npathogenicity on S. obassia. This new species may promote early\ndefoliation of S. obassia during the fall.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gnomoniaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112609.phy"}]}
