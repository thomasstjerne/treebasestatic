The causal agent of the disease was found to be Coniodictyum\nchevalieri, a fungus previously believed to be very rare. Detailed\nillustrations of the symptoms and fungus are presented in order to\nfacilitate future studies. The known geographical distribution of\nConiodictyum is presented in relation to the distribution of its host,\nand a short review of its systematic history is also given. This also\ntreats an invalidly published species name in South Africa, which has\nconfused the literature. A DNA based phylogeny is presented for the\npathogen and this reflects the unique nature of its geographical\ndistribution and biology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule RR","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptobasidiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4599.phy"},{"tree_label":"nj RR","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptobasidiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4600.phy"}]}
