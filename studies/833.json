Gene trees were inferred for Magnaporthe species using\nportions of three genes: actin, beta-tubulin, and calmodulin. These gene\ntrees were found to be concordant and distinguished two distinct clades\nwithin M. grisea. One clade is associated with the grass genus Digitaria\nand is therefore nomenclaturally tied to M. grisea. The other clade is\nassociated with Oryza sativa and other cultivated grasses and is\ndescribed as a new species, M. oryzae. While no morphological characters\nas yet distinguish them, M. oryzae is distinguished from M. grisea by\nseveral base substitutions in each of three loci as well as results from\nlaboratory matings; M.oryzae and M. grisea are not interfertile. Given\nthat M. oryzae is the scientifically correct name for isolates\nassociated with rice blast and grey leaf spot, continued use of M.\ngrisea for such isolates would require formal nomenclatural\nconservation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3987.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5634.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5635.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5636.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5637.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5639.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5640.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5641.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5642.phy"}]}
