Jennwenomyces chiayiensis and J. quadriseptatus\nare new species from decaying culms of Miscanthus floridulus submerged\nin freshwater streams of Alishan area, Chiayi County, Taiwan.\nJennwenomyces cylindroellipsoideus and J. navicularis are new\ncombinations, which are transferred from Endophragmiella\ncylindroellipsoidea and Belemnospora navicularia, respectively. Species\nof Jennwenomyces produce dematiaceous, versicoloured, straight,\nnavicular to cylindrical euseptate phragmospores from multiple\npercurrently proliferating, annellate conidiophores. Conidial secession\nin this genus is schizolytic, leaving a flushed hilum at the base of the\nconidium. The genus is compared with similar hyphomycete genera with\npercurrent conidiophores such as Belemnospora, Endophragmiella,\nJunewangia, Repetophragma, and Sporidesmiella. The phylogenetic\nrelationship of J. chiayiensis and J. quadriseptatus was sought among\nrepresentative taxa from various fungal families by comparing the\nsequences of their nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode) and the partial\nsegment of the large subunit. A key to the four species Jennwenomyces is\ngiven.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Jennwenomyces ITS Tree","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122634","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Jennwenomyces LSU Tree","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122635","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122635.phy"}]}
