The new genus Morronea, including six species ranging from\nMexico to Argentina, is proposed on the basis of morphological\ncharacters. They are plants growing at forests edges, with\nmembranous-ciliate ligules, lower glume reduced, 1/6 to Â¼ the spikelet\nlength, lower palea and lower flower absent, and upper anthecium\nindurate with simple papillae and conspicuous macrohairs all over its\nsurface, and chloroplast ndhF sequences to include six species ranging\nfrom Mexico to Argentina. The new combinations: Morronea arundinariae,\nM. cayoensis, M. guatemalensis, M. incumbens, M. parviglumis, and M.\ntrichidiachnis are proposed and the new genus is compared with other\ngenera of the tribe Paniceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morronea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68070.phy"}]}
