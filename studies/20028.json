Three\nnew species, P. manglietiae, P. pendula and P. pseudopectinata, are\ndescribed and illustrated from tropical China. Phylloporia manglietiae\nis characterized by triquetrous to ungulate basidiomata, 68 pores per\nmm, a monomitic to dimitic hyphal system and broadly ellipsoid\nbasidiospores (33.5 × 22.5 μm). Phylloporia pendula is diagnostic by\nsmall, imbricate and pendent basidiomata, 79 pores per mm, a dimitic\nhyphal system and broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (3.54 ×2.53 μm).\nPhylloporia pseudopectinata differs from other species of Phylloporia by\nits applanate basidiomata, 89 pores per mm, a dimitic hyphal system and\nsubglobose basidiospores (33.5 × 23 μm). Phylogenetic analysis based on\nsequences from nuc 28S rDNA D1-D2 domains supported the position of the\nthree new species in Phylloporia. A key to accepted species of\nPhylloporia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylloporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107812.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylloporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107813.phy"}]}
