A total of 64 specimens representing 29\ntaxa was sampled, including 18 endemic Australian members of subgenus\nLeptostemonum (the \u001aspiny solanums\u001a) section Melongena sensu Symon. Data\nfrom the rDNA ITS region were analyzed using parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood, and Bayesian methods to test the hypothesis that the\ndioecious and andromonoecious Australian species of section Melongena\nconstitute a monophyletic group. Analyses showed strong support for the\nrecognition of five clades among the Australian species of the section,\nbut little support for the monophyly of the section itself. Australian\ndioecious Solanum species form two distinct clades and a number of\nenigmatic and previously unplaced dioecious taxa are here placed within\na single clade. Three groups of andromonoecious species are also each\nmonophyletic and are nested in a polytomy with three clusters of species\nfrom outside section Melongena. Furthermore, the phylogeny indicates\nthat dioecy has evolved either once or twice in Australian Solanum,\npossibly from andromonoecious ancestry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Australian Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_921.phy"}]}
