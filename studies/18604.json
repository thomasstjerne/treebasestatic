There is a longstanding debate over the biogeographic history of\nthe genus, with the Palearctic and Neotropical regions proposed as\nalternate centers of origin. We contribute to a resolution of this\ndebate with the recent discovery and analysis of an extant species from\ncentral Brazil, L. relictus sp. n.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Formicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92236.phy"}]}
