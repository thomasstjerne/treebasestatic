Moreover, the connections between\nasexual and sexual morphs of these genera are unclear. In this study,\nfresh samples of Dothidotthia and Thyrostroma were collected from\nsymptomatic twigs and branches in Southern European Russia. Multi-gene\nphylogenetic analyses based on a concatenated LSU, SSU, ITS and TEF1\nsequence data were used to investigate the phylogenetic position and\nrelationships of the asexual and sexual morphs in these genera in\nDothidotthiaceae and Pleosporineae. Our multi-gene phylogenetic analyses\ncoupled with morphological characters showed Dothidotthia and\nThyrostroma can easily be distinguished from one another. The new\nspecies, Dothidotthia aceris, D. robiniae, Thyrostroma celtidis, T.\nlycii, T. moricola, T. robiniae, T. styphnolobii, T. tiliae, T. ulmicola\nand T. ulmigenum are introduced. Descriptions, notes and illustrations\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidotthiaceae 55x3102","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120962.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidotthiaceae 55x3102","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120961.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidotthiaceae 124x3200","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120956.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporinae 131x3197","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120959.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporinae 131x3197","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120958.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporinae 131x3197","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120957.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidotthiaceae 50x3103","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120960.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule MP","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothidotthiaceae 55x3102","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120963.phy"}]}
