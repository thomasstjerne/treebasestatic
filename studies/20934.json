It features\nencrusting colony morphology with a thin, funnel-shaped polypary.\nSinularia mesophotica sp. n.Â (family Alcyoniidae) is described and\ncompared to the other congeners with similar morphology. Both the\nmorphological and molecular examination justified the establishment of\nthe new species, also assigning it to a new genetic clade within\nSinularia. The results highlight its unique phylogenetic position within\nthe genus, and this is the first described species of a mesophotic\nzooxanthellate octocoral.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107085.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107087.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sinularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107086.phy"}]}
