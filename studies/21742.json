It usually\ngrows on a smooth bark of trees in forests of northern Poland, Ukraine\nand the Czech Republic. It is chemically similar to the sorediate L.\ncompallens, which however has an episubstratal thallus in non-sorediate\nparts and often delimited soralia. They have also different phylogenetic\npositions within the L. symmicta group. Moreover, based on molecular\nmarkers analysis the position of L. expallens is resolved within this\ngroup for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107613.phy"}]}
