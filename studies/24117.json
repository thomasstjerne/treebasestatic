A new\ncombination F. bugellensis is proposed and the lectotype for this taxon\nwas selected. The genus is characterized by fascicles of skeletal-like\nhyphae in aculeal trama and thick-walled basidiospores. The generic\nconcept was supported by Bayesian and MaximumLikelihood molecular\nphylogenetic reconstructions based on the ITS region and D1/D2 domains\nof 28S rRNA gene. The morphological distinctions between Lyomyces pruni\nand F. bugellensis (earlier considered as conspecific) and their\nphylogenetic independence are described and illustrated. Additionally,\nDeviodontia pilaecystidiata is put into the genus Kneiffiella;\nHyphodontia mongolica is referred to synonyms of K. pilaecystidiata. The\nphylogenetic position of Hastodontia halonata, Kneiffiella alienata, and\nLyomyces fimbriatus are discussed for the first time, and the new\ncombination Lyomyces fimbriatus is introduced.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116854","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116854.phy"}]}
