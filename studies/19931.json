Although Red\nSnapper (Lutjanus campechanus) is an economically important species in\nrecreational fisheries and a primary aquaculture candidate, no\ninformation is available on the microbial communities of this species.\nThe aim of this study was to survey the microbiota of apparently\nhealthy, wild-caught Red Snapper from the Gulf of Mexico. Sampled Red\nSnapper showed no physical signs of disease. Tissues that are either\nprimary entry routes for pathogens (feces, gill) or essential to disease\ndiagnosis (blood) were sampled. Bacteria were enumerated using\nculture-based techniques and characterized by pyrosequencing. Results:\nAerobic counts of feces and gill samples were 107 and 104 CFU/g,\nrespectively. All individuals had positive blood cultures with counts up\nto 23 CFU/g. Gammaproteobacteria dominated the microbiota of all sample\ntypes, including the genera Pseudoalteromonas and Photobacterium in\nfeces and Pseudomonas in blood and gill. Gill samples were also\ndominated by Vibrio while blood samples had high abundances of Nevskia.\nHigh variability in microbiota composition was observed between\nindividuals, with percent differences in community composition ranging\nfrom 6-76% in feces, 10-58% in gill, and 52-64% in blood. Conclusions:\nThis study provides the first characterization of the microbiota of the\neconomically significant Red Snapper via pyrosequencing. Its role in\nfish health highlights the importance of understanding microbiota\ncomposition for future work on disease prevention using microbial\nmanipulation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Snapper_Communities","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98659.phy"},{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree 1","ntax":"3","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98660.phy"}]}
