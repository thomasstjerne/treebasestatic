Characters used to distinguish nephtyid genera are a matter of\ncontroversy and considerable confusion remains as to the generic\ndelineations. The phylogeny is estimated with molecular data from the\nmitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 16S rDNA, the nuclear\ngenes 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA, and morphological data. The results reveal\ntwo well-supported major clades, corresponding in part to the two main\ngenera of the family, Aglaophamus and Nephtys. The species N. pulchra\nand N. australiensis are transferred to Aglaophamus, and new diagnoses\nfor the genera are provided. Nephtys cornuta is sister to the remaining\nnephtyids and is referred to the new genus Bipalponephtys, together with\nN. danida. Micronephthys is sister to Nephtys, Dentinephtys may be\nnested within Nephtys, and Inermonephtys is of uncertain position.\nDentinephtys may be a junior synonym of Nephtys, but is at present left\nas a separate genus in lack of strong support.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nephtyidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nephtyidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6303.phy"}]}
