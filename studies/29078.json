In this study, the photobionts of three Multiclavula\nspecies (M. mucida, M. petricola, and M. vernalis) collected in Japan\nwere isolated and cultured, and identified using light microscopy, TEM,\nand molecular sequence analyses. Previously, identifications of the\nphotobionts associated with Multiclavula have centered on Coccomyxa. In\nour material, we found instead that the photobiont of M. mucida is\nElliptochloris subsphaerica, and that of M. petricola and M. vernalis is\na new species, described herein as Elliptochloris parasphaerica. This is\nthe first report of Elliptochloris as a photobiont of lichenized\nbasidiomycetes. In the phylogenetic analysis of rbcL+18S rDNA, E.\nsubsphaerica was composed of six subclades, and M. mucida showed a\nstrong tendency to select one specific subclade for the photobiont.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134693","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134693.phy"}]}
