A phylogenetic analysis of\nthe recently revealed microbial family of globin-coupled hemebased\nsensors suggests that these sensors descended from an ancient\nglobin-only progenitor, or a protoglobin (Pgb). Here, we report the\ndiscovery and characterization of two Pgbs from the Archaea: ApPgb from\nthe obligately aerobic hyperthermophile Aeropyrum pernix, and MaPgb from\nthe strictly anaerobic methanogen Methanosarcina acetivorans. Both ApPgb\nand MaPgb bind molecular oxygen, nitric oxide, and carbon monoxide by\nmeans of a heme moiety that is coordinated to the protein through the F8\nhistidine (histidine 120). We postulate that these archaeal globins are\nthe ancestors of contemporary hemoglobins. keywords: globin-coupled\nsensor","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globin tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2241.phy"}]}
