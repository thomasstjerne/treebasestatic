We examine phylogeographic\npatterns in a clade of lowland salamanders (Bolitoglossa subgenus\nNanotriton) using two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene. We use\nseveral phylogeographic analyses to infer the history of this clade and\ntest hypotheses regarding the geographic origin of species and location\nof genetic breaks within species. We compare our results to those for\nother taxa to determine if historical events impacted different species\nin a similar manner.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lowland Tropical Salamanders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60068.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lowland Tropical Salamanders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60071.phy"}]}
