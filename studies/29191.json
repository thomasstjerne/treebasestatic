The genus is characterized by\nmononematous, septate, brown or dark brown conidiophores, monotretic\nconidiogenous cells and catenate, obclavate, olivaceous to blackish\nbrown conidia. Pleocatenata form a distinct phylogenetic lineage in the\nPleosporales, Dothideomycetes, supported by phylogenetic analysis which\ncombined LSU, SSU, ITS, tef1 and rpb2 sequence data. Therefore,\nPleocatenata is assigned as Pleosporales genera incertae sedis,\ndescriptions and illustrations of the new taxa are provided, other\nsimilar morphology genera are also compared and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134963.phy"}]}
