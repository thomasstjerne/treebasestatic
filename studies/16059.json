However, the hypothesis that defense mutualism consistently\nenhance plant diversification across lineages has not been well-tested\ndue to a lack of phenotypic and phylogenetic information. Using a global\nanalysis, we show that among the >100 vascular plant families that\nhave evolved plant organs that recruit arthropod mutualists, extrafloral\nnectaries, have two-fold higher diversification rates than families that\nlack extrafloral nectaries. In fine-scale examinations of six distantly\nrelated plant groups trait-dependent diversification models confirmed\nthe tendency for lineages with extrafloral nectaries to display\nincreased rates of diversification. In sister clade comparisons, we\nfound greater number of rate shifts in EFN lineages than non-EFN sister\nlineages. This replicated analysis indicates that defense mutualisms put\nlineages on a path towards increased diversification rates within and\nbetween clades, and is concordant with the hypothesis that deep\nmacroevolutionary patterns of plant diversity are impacted by local\nmutualistic interactions with animals.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76465","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76465.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75945","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75945.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75948","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75948.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75950","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75950.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75946","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75946.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75949","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75949.phy"}]}
