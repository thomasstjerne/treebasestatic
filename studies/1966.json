Population genetic analysis led to the discovery of\nmorphologically indistinguishable but reproductively isolated cryptic\nspecies (CSP) within Phialocephala fortinii s.l. In the present study we\nshow, that sequence data of two coding (beta-tubulin and translation\nelongation factor (EF-1alpha)) and three non-coding DNA loci confirm\nsubdivision of P. fortinii s.l. and allow to differentiate seven CSP of\nP. fortinii. In addition, we show that strains collected throughout\nEurope can be classified correctly based on these sequence markers.\nStatistically significant differences in growth response on different\nmedia were observed among CSP of P. fortinii and A. applanata. Growth\ninhibition on MEA amended with 100 mgl-1 cycloheximide had the strongest\ndifferential effect of all physiological traits examined. In contrast,\nexoenzyme production (laccase, proteinase, pectinase, phenol-oxidase,\namylase, cytochrome oxidase, and tyrosinase) rarely helped to\ndifferentiate CSP of P. fortinii. However, A. applanata was a strong\nproducer of amylases, laccases, and proteinases. Based on these data we\npropose to assign species rank to six CSP of P. fortinii: P.\nturiciensis, P. letzii, P. europaea, P. helvetica, P. uotolensis, P.\nsubalpina spp. nov. and P. fortinii s.s.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, 4 loci concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2937.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, 5 loci concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2938.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary 01","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, beta tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2939.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary 02","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, Elongation factor 1-alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2940.phy"},{"tree_label":"Suppementary 03","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, pPF-018","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2941.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary 04","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, pPF-076","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2942.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supplementary 05","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phialocephala, pPF-061","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2943.phy"}]}
