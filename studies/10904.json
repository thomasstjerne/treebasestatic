This is particularly\nimportant for the green algae because in many genera structural\ncharacters are few or difficult to observe. In this study we test the\nutility of several DNA barcode loci in seven distantly related species\ngroups of charophytes and chlorophytes. The ITS and COI markers were the\nmost variable, although COI was least applicable because it was\nsuccessfully amplified and sequenced in only one test genus. Both rbcL\nand tufA were moderately variable, although tufA may pose challenges in\nsome lineages where the gene is encoded in the nucleus. The 18S and UPA\nwere the least variable loci tested. Of the markers tested, ITS, rbcL\nand tufA are the most promising for use as DNA barcodes. However, none\nof the loci tested were ideal for use across all tested lineages of\ngreen algae because of taxon-specific applicability and because none of\nthe markers could distinguish closely related species in all species\ngroups tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS NJ Chlorosarcinopsis","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorosarcinopsis","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25427.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2 NJ Chara","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chara","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26126.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1 NJ Nitella","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nitella","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26128.phy"},{"tree_label":"rbcL NJ Micrasterias","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Micrasterias","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26129.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1 NJ Desmidium","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Desmidium","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26127.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2 NJ Bracteacoccus","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bracteacoccus","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25429.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS NJ Scenedesmus","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scenedesmus","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25430.phy"}]}
