This paper describes\nin detail the anatomy and histology of a new taxon of early\nornithuromorph bird, Hollanda luceria, from the Barun Goyot Formation at\nKhermeen Tsav in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. The new taxon is\nrepresented exclusively by hindlimb elements, and is characterized by\nhaving elongated hindlimbs with an extremely reduced metatarsal IV and\nan unusual tibiotarsal-femoral articulation centered on a highly peaked\nlateral articular facet of the tibiotarsus. Cladistic and ecospace\nanalyses were also carried out in order to infer evolutionary\nrelationships and ecology of this primitive bird. These analyses\nindicate that the new taxon is a previously undescribed lineage of basal\nornithuromorph and an outgroup of Ornithurae (sensu Chiappe, 2002),\nwhich may have had a cursorial lifestyle similar to that of the modern\nroadrunner, Geococcyx californianus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5A","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55531.phy"}]}
