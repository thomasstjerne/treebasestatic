A\nlack of clearly homologous characters and the absence of an informative\nfossil record have prevented us from deriving a consistent evolutionary\nframework for the phylum. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis, using\n53 small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences from a wide range of nematodes.\nWith this analysis, we can compare animal-parasitic, plant-parasitic and\nfree-living taxa using a common measurement. Our results indicate that\nconvergent morphological evolution may be extensive and that present\nhigher-level classification of the Nematoda will need revision. We\nidentify five major clades within the phylum, all of which include\nparasitic species. We suggest that animal parasitism arose independently\nat least four times, and plant parasitism three times. We clarify the\nrelationship of C. elegans to major parasitic groups; this will allow\nmore effective exploitation of our genetic and biological knowledge of\nthis model species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nematoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1376.phy"}]}
