The concatenated\nsupermatrix contained 72.8 % of missing data. From this dataset,\nBayesian inference showed close relationships of Arvicola and Chionomys,\nProedromys with Lasiopodomys and Microtus gregalis, Phaiomys with Neodon\nand M. clarkei. Genus Microtus formed a supported group with\nBlanfordimys and N. juldaschi. The gene partition taxon sets were\nexplained in the multilocus phylogeny in such a way that the resulting\nBayesian inference tree represented a unique solution on a terrace in\nthe tree space. This means that although the supermatrix contained a\nlarge proportion of missing data, it was informative in retrieving a\nphylogeny with a unique optimality score, tree likelihood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline ghr Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60904.phy"},{"tree_label":"supertree","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline SuperTriplets supertree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60908.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline irbp Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60907.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline control region","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60906.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline nd4 Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60898.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline coi Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60897.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline lcat Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60899.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline sry Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60903.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline supermatrix Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52517.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arvicoline mtcyb Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60905.phy"}]}
