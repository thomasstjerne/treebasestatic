Eucalyptus. These paralogues, which include non-functional\npseudogenes, probably diverged prior to the differentiation of species\ngroups in subg. Eucalyptus. When compared with presumably functional\nsequences, the pseudogenes show greater sequence variation between\nspecies, particularly in the 5.8S gene. They are also characterised by\nreduced GC content, associated with a reduced number of CpG and CpNpG\nmethylation sites, and an increase in the inferred number of\nmethylation-induced substitutions. Some pseudogenes also lack motifs\nthat are usually conserved in plants, both in ITS1 and the 5.8S gene.\nTwo main lineages of pseudogenes are identified, one isolated from a\ngroup of western Australian species, one from a group of eastern\nAustralian species. It is not clear whether these two lineages of\npseudogenes are orthologous, or represent independent divergences from\nfunctional sequence types. The presence of divergent rDNA paralogues\nhighlights the need for caution when interpreting eucalypt phylogenies\nbased on ITS sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Divergent paralogues of ribosomal DNA in eucalypts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2651.phy"}]}
