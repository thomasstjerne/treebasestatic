In Florida, specimens of Imleria were\ncollected that resembled I. badia, a species known primarily from\nnortheastern North America and Europe. Five nuclear loci of these\nFlorida specimens were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. A nuc\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA (ITS) phylogeny of Imleria was generated using\nprimarily uncultured environmental sequences to confirm ectomycorrhizal\nassociations. Based on morphological and molecular data, we describe a\nnew species, Imleria floridana. Results from these analyses also support\nthe new combination Imleria pallida. A lectotype of I. pallida is also\nestablished from Charles H. PeckÂ’s original material. We discuss the\ndistinguishing characters and species of Imleria found in North America\nand provide a key to the known worldwide species of Imleria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120195","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120195.phy"}]}
