Effective efforts to improve A. bisporus through breeding\nwill require a greater understanding of the evolutionary relationships\nbetween A. bisporus and other Agaricus species. We present here the\ncomplete mitochondrial atp6 gene of A. bitorquis and amplified\nhomologues from 9 other species of Agaricus, including 6 different\nisolates of A. bisporus. Unexpectedly, only 2 variants of atp6 were\nfound among the 6 isolates of A. bisporus, which had been chosen to\nrepresent mitochondrial types thought to be highly divergent based on\nRFLP data. Although interspecific variation was high, parsimony and\nmaximum likelihood analyses resulted in identical phylogenetic trees for\nthe genus: A. bisporus, A. subfloccosus and A. subperonatus were tightly\nclustered as a single subgroup, whereas the remaining species were\nhighly divergent. The species representatives with the closest proximity\nto the A. bisporus cluster were A. bitorquis and A. campestris, which is\nin agreement with published phylogenies derived from nuclear sequence\ndata. Incongruency between this mitochondrial gene-based phylogeny and a\nphylogeny of linear mitochondrial plasmids found in these same species\nindicates separate evolutionary histories for the plasmids and their\nhost mitochondria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3635.phy"}]}
