Two\nalternative diversification scenarios were tested in two co-distributed,\nNorthern Hemisphere clades: (1) clade ancestors were temperate, and\nenvironmental niche has been conserved over evolutionary time, implying\nthat speciation was driven by vicariance associated with ice sheet\nformation; and (2) clade ancestors were Arctic, and species convergently\nadapted to temperate environmental conditions, implying that speciation\nwas driven by repeated adaption to temperate environments. Location\nNorthern Hemisphere Arctic and subarctic oceans. Methods Fifty-five new\nsequences of four genes from 23 tissue samples were combined with 10\nGenBank sequences to generate a time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis.\nCombining the phylogeny with information on species ecological niche\ntolerances inferred from correlational models, I reconstructed ancestral\nenvironmental tolerances of each of the focal clades. These results were\ncombined with Bayesian area-based biogeographical analysis and regional\npalaeoclimatic history to develop a holistic biogeographical history of\nGadinae. Results Of 18 environmental variables describing species\ntolerances to salinity, temperature, sea ice concentration, and mixed\nlayer depth, only mean, maximum and minimum sea bottom temperature, and\nmean and minimum sea surface temperature showed phylogenetic signal\nacross Gadinae. Both ecological niche and geographical distributions of\ngadine fishes are largely conservative, but two clades contain both\nPacific and Atlantic species. Focal clade divergence time estimates\nsuggest a Pliocene origin for both, with further Pleistocene divergence.\nMain conclusions Reconstructed ancestral environmental tolerances of\ncrown cods and tomcods support a temperate origin of both groups. The\ntiming of diversification of these two clades and the intolerance of\ntemperate species to sea ice suggest that cyclical Arctic ice formation\ndrove divergence. Future sea ice reduction may have dramatic\nconsequences for distributions and persistence of commercially important\nspecies, when currently allopatric temperate species come into secondary\ncontact.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gadinae","tree_kind":"Species
