In the present study, 10 new species of the genus were isolated\nfrom human and animal clinical specimens from the USA. They are proposed\nand characterized on the basis of their morphology and a molecular\nphylogenetic analysis using DNA sequences from three loci (the ITS\nregion of the rDNA, and partial fragments of the translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha and actin genes). Six of those species belong to the C.\ncladosporioides species complex, i.e., C. alboflavescens, C. angulosum,\nC. anthropophilum, C. crousii, C. flavovirens and C. xantochromaticum,\nthree new species belong to the C. herbarum species complex, i.e., C.\nfloccosum, C. subcinereum and C. tuberosum; and one to the C.\nsphaerospermum species complex, namely, C. succulentum. Differential\nmorphological features of the new taxa are provided together with\nmolecular barcodes to distinguish them from the currently accepted\nspecies of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97040.phy"}]}
