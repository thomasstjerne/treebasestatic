This study confirms the hybrid origin of one E. x truncatum\npopulation in central Indiana through analysis of DNA sequence data from\nnuclear ITS and corroborates the morphology-based hypothesis that E.\nperfoliatum and E. serotinum are its progenitors. Moreover, two\nsingle-copy nuclear loci showing fixed differences between the parents\nwere in the heterozygous form in all hybrids analyzed, suggesting that\nthese are all F1 hybrids. Plastid psbA-trnH intergenic spacer sequences\nidentify E. serotinum as the maternal progenitor of all sampled\nhybrids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupatorium x truncatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6819.phy"}]}
