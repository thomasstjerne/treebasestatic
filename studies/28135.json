Marasmius yunnanensis is\ncharacterized by its semicircular to subround basidiocarps,\nplicate-reticulate pileus, interwoven lamellae, a monomitic hyphal\nsystem, pileipellis cells and cheilocystidia in the form of broom-cells\nof the Rotalis-type, and ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 810 × 56.2\nμm. Marasmiellus brevistipitatus is characterized by its yellow to pale\nyellow basidiocarps, gregarious on dead bamboo, intervenose lamellae\nwhich is concolorous with the pileal surface, a monomitic hyphal system\nand ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 68.3 × 34.3 μm","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133997.phy"}]}
