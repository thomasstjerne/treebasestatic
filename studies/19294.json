Within the tribe Gnaphalieae, the genus is characterized by\ncapitula arranged in spikes or head-like clusters, few hermaphroditic\ncentral florets, truncate style branches with apical sweeping trichomes,\npappus bristles connate at the base into a ring falling as a unit, and\nachenes with globose twin trichomes. Previous molecular phylogenetic\nstudies have suggested the paraphyly of the genus, but have not provided\na basis for redefining generic limits due to incomplete taxon sampling.\nTo address this problem, DNA sequences from the plastid (trnL-F) and\nnuclear (ETS and ITS) genomes were analyzed from a broad taxon sample\nrepresenting the full range of morphological variation known in the\ngenus. Our results affirm that Gamochaeta is paraphyletic as presently\ncircumscribed. Two clades can be recognized: one clade that includes the\nmajority of the species currently assigned to Gamochaeta and a second\nclade that includes Gamochaetopsis, Stuckertiella and seven species of\nGamochaeta. We present here a new circumscription of Gamochaeta,\nincluding two new combinations, Gamochaeta alpina and Gamochaeta\nperegrina, and the resurrection of Gamochaeta capitata. Our results also\nshow Omalotheca supina, O. norvegica and O. sylvatica, which were placed\nby some authors in Gamochaeta or in Gnaphalium, form a monophyletic\ngroup distantly related to both genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96008.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96009","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96009.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96007.phy"}]}
