However, many species of Sclerococcum have been\nidentified based only on morphology. This study provides sequences for\nlarge-subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and\nmitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal RNA (mtSSU) for the first time for\nSclerococcum simplex and the first geographical record of the genus from\nChina. The phylogenetic analyses of Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian\ninference (BI) confirmed S. simplex clustered within Sclerococcum sensu\nstricto while the genus was recovered as polyphyletic in\nDactylosporaceae. Our strain of Sclerococcum simplex in its asexual\nstate was collected on Pertusaria host thallus growing on bark. The\ntaxonomic affinity of S. simplex is investigated based on phylogenetic\nand morphological evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132241","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132241.phy"}]}
