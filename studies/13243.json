The second,\nSantonian-age radiation of Hadrosauroidea included Aralosaurus,\nHadrosauridae and lineages leading to Tanius (Campanian) and\nTelmatosaurus (Maastrichtian). Hadrosauridae appears to be monophyletic,\nbut Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae originated in North America and\nAsia, respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56003.phy"}]}
