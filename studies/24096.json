Updated phylogenies are central to\nthis understanding. Most cladograms of Flaviviridae focus on specific\nlineages and ignore outgroups, hampering the efficacy of the analysis to\ntest ingroup monophyly and relationships. This is due to the lack of\nannotated Flaviviridae genomes, which has gene content variation among\ngenera. This variation makes analysis without partitioning difficult.\nTherefore, we developed an annotation pipeline for the genera of\nFlaviviridae (Flavirirus, Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, and Pestivirus, named\n“Fast Loci Annotation of Viruses” (FLAVi; flavi-web.com), that combines\nab initio and homology-based strategies. FLAVi recovered 100% of the\ngenes in Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genomes. In Pegivirus and\nPestivirus, annotation efficiency was 100% except for one partition\neach. There were no false positives. The combined phylogenetic analysis\nof multiple genes made possible by annotation has clear impacts over the\ntree topology compared to phylogenies that we inferred without outgroups\nor data partitioning. The final tree is largely congruent with previous\nhypotheses and adds evidence supporting the close phylogenetic\nrelationship between dengue and Zika.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree28","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116379.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree24","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116380.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree19","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree15","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116392.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree20","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116393.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree29","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116381.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree25","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116382.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree30","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree11","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116384.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree16","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116385.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree12","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree17","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116387.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree13","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116388","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree18","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116389.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree14","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116390","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree21","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116374","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116374.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree26","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116375","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116375.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree22","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116376","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116376.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree27","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116377","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116377.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree23","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116378.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree0","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116363","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116363.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116364","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116364.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree2","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116365","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116365.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree3","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116366","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116366.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree7","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116367","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116367.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree4","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116368","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116368.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree8","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree5","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree9","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree6","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116372","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116372.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree10","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116373","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":
