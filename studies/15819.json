As the\nrepresentatives of secondary aquatic mammals, cetaceans have grasped the\nevolutionistsâ attraction to investigate their mysterious evolutionary\nhistory. For this reason, we make a systematic survey on major lineages\nof cetaceans including representative toothed and baleen whales to\ninvestigate the evolution of the these five basic taste modalities.\nResultsï¼Here, all five basic taste modalities: sour, sweet, bitter,\nsalt and umami tastes were investigated in cetaceans. The sequence\ncharacteristics and evolutionary analyses suggested that nearly all\ncetaceans have lost all taste modalities except for salt. Interestingly,\nthe time estimated for these pseudogenization events occurred varied\namong taste genes, however, overall these times are close to the tMRCA\n(the time to the most recent common ancestor) of toothed and baleen\nwhales. Conclusions: This is the first time to clarify the five basic\ntaste modalities in marine mammals. Our research indicated that\ncetaceans have lost four basic taste modalities including sour, sweet,\numami, and major of bitter taste. The transition from land to water at\napproximately 52.5 Mya and subsequent great changes in feeding behavior\nand circumstances they lived in might contribute to the loss of the four\ntastes. The integrity of salt taste receptor genes in all cetaceans\nstudied here, may owe to its function in Na+ reabsorbing, which is key\nto osmoregulation in aquatic adaptation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75096","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75096.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75097","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75098.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75101","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75101.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75102","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75103","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75103.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75107.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75104","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75104.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75095","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75095.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75108","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75108.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75105","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75105.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75106.phy"}]}
