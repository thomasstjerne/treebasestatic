These studies, however, were limited to western Mediterranean\nspecies. This study examines mitochondrial 12S sequences and nuclear\nITS1&2 sequences of both eastern and western species, and\ndemonstrates that Albinaria, in its most recent definition, is not\nmonophyletic. Both molecular datasets place ‘Albinaria’ hedenborgi from\nLebanon in a well-supported clade with species of the genus Cristataria,\ndistributed southeast of the vicariant range of Albinaria. The remaining\nspecies from Cyprus, Turkey and Greece, constitute a well-supported\nmonophyletic group. These two clades form geographic clusters, whereas\nAlbinaria in the current definition - including ‘A.’ hedenborgi- has a\ndisjunct distribution. ‘Albinaria’ hedenborgi should therefore be\nclassified with Cristataria, together with the morphologically similar\nand geographically close ‘A.’ nadimi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albinaria, 12S strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2163.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albinaria, combined strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2164.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albinaria, ITS1&2 strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2162.phy"}]}
