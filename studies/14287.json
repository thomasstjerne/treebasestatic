It is necessary to predict them based\non divergence estimates of different species. Here, there are some\nfragmentary samples from closely related species that difficult to be\nidentified only using comparative morphology for divergence analyzing\ndirectly. Hence, both the standard COI barcode and Cytb gene are applied\nto calculate the K2P genetic distances and neighbor-joining (NJ) trees\nto distinguish species, and to execute maximum likelihood (ML) and\nBayesian inferences for estimating recent divergence of extant Glires\nspecies constrained with a set of eight fossils in Xinjiang, China. The\nresults show that DNA barcoding has identified these samples, with the\nexceptions of several sequenced species. Moreover, cryptic species may\nexist in Allactaga and Dipus, and the massive speciation events emerged\nduring the Middle and the Late Miocene. This study infers that the\nevolutionary trends and faunal exchanges may be associated with the\nfinal India-Asia continental collisions and Tethys Sea retreated from\nthe Tarim Basin around the Eocene-the Oligocene boundary as well as\nglobal climate fluctuations during the Miocene. Furthermore, the\naridification and the changes of Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut Deserts\nmight drive the diversification of subspecies, divergences of\ngeographical populations and the emergences of cryptic species since the\nLate Pleistocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 Cytb 425","ntax":"425","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64108.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cytb 425 STATE 50","ntax":"425","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64109.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cytb 425 STATE 100","ntax":"425","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64110.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI 197 STATE 50","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rodentia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64112.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI 197 STATE 50","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rodentia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64113.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI 197","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rodentia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI 75","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64106.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI 75","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64107.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1 COI 75","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64105.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1 COI 197","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rodentia NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64111.phy"}]}
