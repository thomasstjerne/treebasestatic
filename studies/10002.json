Fungi were\ncharacterized by fluorescence microscopy, culturing, and sequence\nanalyses of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers. A total of 270\nfungal colonies were cultured from the accretion ice of subglacial Lake\nVostok, and an additional 14 from the glacial ice immediately above the\naccretion ice. Mean cell concentrations were from 0 to 4.42 cells ml-1\nof ice meltwater, of which 0 to 100% were viable (as determined by\nfluorescence microscopy). Thirty-one unique fungal ribosomal DNA\nsequences (28 from accretion ice and 3 from glacial ice) were determined\nand compared to recent taxa. The results, plus tests for growth of low\ntemperatures, indicate that Lake Vostok contains a mixture of\nheterotrophic psychrotolerant fungal species. This indicates that the\nlake is not sterile, but contains a unique ecosystem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungi from Lake Vostok accretion ice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6691.phy"}]}
