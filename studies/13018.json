The\npresent study reconsiders the taxonomic placement of this interesting\nspecimen, given the significant advances in understanding of the\nTroodontidae that have taken place since it was first described.\nMorphological comparisons and numerical phylogentic analyses indicate\nthat V 10597 differs significantly from other troodontids, including L.\ntani, in numerous hindlimb features and particularly in the proportions\nof various hindlimb elements. These differences are likely to be\ntaxonomic, and suggest that V 10597 represents a new troodontid.\nFurthermore, histological analysis indicates that V 10597 is unlikely to\nbe a juvenile of L. tani or any other large troodontid. Based on the\navailable morphological and histological information, we propose the\nerection of a new taxon, Philovenator gen. et sp. nov., based on V\n10597. This new find increases the known taxonomic diversity and\nmorphological disparity of Late Cretaceous troodontids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3A","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Troodontidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55256.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Troodontidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55257.phy"}]}
