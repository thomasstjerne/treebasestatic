Its\nmorphological characters include: ocher and epilithic thalli,\npseudolecanorine or lecideine and sessile apothecia, flat and epruinose\napothecial discs, Mischoblastia-type ascospores with funnel-shaped cell\nlumina and filiform conidia. This is the second saxicolous species in\nthe genus Sculptolumina. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed\nfor Sculptolumina, including S. japonica and S. yunnanensis, for the\nfirst time. A multilocus phylogeny of Buellia s.l. revealed that\nSculptolumina forms a monophyletic clade with high support, and S.\njaponica and S. yunnanensis have a sister relationship within this\nclade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buellia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_118990.phy"}]}
