Here, we presented a phylogenetic reconstruction\nfor this group based on mitochondrial genome data, with an emphasis on\neffects of analytical methods on the performance of this marker system\nfor insect phylogeny. Our analyses included 152 taxa, of which 104\nspecies represent all the major polyneopteran lineages. The results\ndemonstrate that model selection, data coding methods, and outgroup\nchoice can have marked effects on the reconstructed phylogenetic\nrelationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90537.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90538","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90538.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90539","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90539.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90540","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90540.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90535","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90535.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90536","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90536.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90533","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90533.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90534","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90534.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90541","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90541.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90542","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90542.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90543","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90543.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90544","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90544.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90545","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90545.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90546","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90546.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90547","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90547.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90548","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90548.phy"}]}
