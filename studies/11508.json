We use mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and two nuclear\ngenes, the elongation factor-1alpha and LW rhodopsin, to investigate the\nphylogeny of Sphecidae digger wasps. We focus particularly on the tribe\nAmmophilini, a clade of non-social apoid wasps that exhibits unusually\ndiverse parental care strategies. We analyse a 2232 base pair dataset\nfor 40 ammophilines plus 9 other taxa from within the remaining\nSphecidae. Our Bayesian phylogeny provides strong support for the\nmonophyly of Ammophilini and for the monophyly of all six individual\nammophiline genera, except that the position of P. affinis within the\ngenus Podalonia is only weakly supported. Monophyly of some but not all\npreviously designated species groups within the genus Ammophila is\nsupported. We discuss the implications of our results for the evolution\nof morphological traits used previously in ammophiline systematics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ammophilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_46081.phy"}]}
