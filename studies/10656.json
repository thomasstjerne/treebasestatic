Meanwhile it is best known for the host plants of\nRafflesiaceae (including Rafflesia, with the largest flower in the\nworld. The phylogeny of Tetrastigma, however, remains poorly known. Four\nplastid markers (trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, rps16 intron, atpB-rbcL\nintergenic spacer, and psbA-trnH intergenic spacer) were employed to\ninfer the first phylogeny of Tetrastigma. Our sampling included eleven\nreported host species of Rafflesiaceae, and these eleven species were\nscattered in seven major clades throughout the Tetrastigma tree,\nsuggesting multiple origins of the parasite-host relationship. Analysis\nof 114 accessions representing 53 species and four varieties throughout\nthe distributional range of the genus provided robust support for the\nmonophyly of Tetrastigma, yet Tetrastigma is supported to be nested\nwithin Cayratia. Tetrastigma subgenus Palmicirrata from the\nSino-Himalayan region is nested within the large and widely distributed\nsubgenus Tetrastigma. Two major clades (clades A and F) in our phylogeny\ncorrespond to section Tetrastigma and section Carinata of subgenus\nTetrastigma, respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9916.phy"}]}
