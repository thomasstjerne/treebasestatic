The\ninterspecific pairwise sequence divergence, based on uncorrected p\ndistance, varied up to 10% across the COII, 4.9% across the 16S, and 3%\nacross the 12S fragments. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using\nmaximum parsimony, likelihood, and distance methods. The combined\nresults suggest several phylogenetic relationships including: (i) R.\nflavipes, R. arenincola, and European R. santonensis are possibly\nconspecific; (ii) R. virginicus and R. hageni are closely related\nspecies; and (iii) R. tibialis and R. hesperus are closely related\nspecies. Interestingly, while there is apparent synonymity between R.\nflavipes and R. arenincola by DNA sequence, there are clear\nmorphological differences in the soldier caste. This finding suggests a\ncombination of molecular and morphological approaches are necessary for\naccurate species identification. These data lend resolution to the\ncomplex problem of Reticulitermes systematics, and will assist future\nefforts directed toward characterizing species distribution and ecology.\nKeywords: Subterranean termite; mtDNA; COII; 12S; 16S; Phylogenetics;\nMolecular systematics","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes, 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_219.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes, 12S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_288.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes, COII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes, COII prot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4372.phy"}]}
