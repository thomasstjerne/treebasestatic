Fungal identifications were made\nusing a combination of morphology together with a phylogenetic analysis\nbased on partial translation elongation factor 1-Î± sequence (EF-1Î±)\nand internal transcribed spacers (ITS). Five species of Lasiodiplodia\nwere identified: Lasiodiplodia brasiliense sp. nov., L. hormozganensis,\nL. marypalme sp. nov., L. pseudotheobromae and L. theobromae. Only L.\ntheobromae had previously been reported in papaya, while all the other\nspecies are reported for the first time in association with this host in\nBrazil and worldwide. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most prevalent\nspecies. All species of Lasiodiplodia were pathogenic on papaya fruit,\nwith L. hormozganensis being the most virulent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66404.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66405.phy"}]}
