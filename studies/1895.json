Other distinct clades represent the\nSchizothyriaceae, Davidiellaceae, Capnodiaceae,and the\nMycosphaerellaceae. Within the two major clades, namely\nTeratosphaeriaceae and Mycosphaerellaceae, most anamorph genera are\npolyphyletic, and new anamorphconcepts need to be derived to cope with\ndual nomenclature within the Mycosphaerella complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, 1 of 1135 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, 50% maj rule cons of 18815 trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4915.phy"}]}
