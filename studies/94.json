Cladistic analyses suggest\nthat its closest relatives are Pleea and Harperocallis rather than\nTofieldia s. str. or Triantha. Isidrogalvia differs substantively from\nits Northern Hemisphere relatives in having styles that are united to\ntheir apices or nearly so, tomentose leaf margins, and a seed appendage\nthat is decurrent along the seed body. In addition, it differs from\nTofieldia and Triantha in having scapes that bear many bracts, most of\nwhich are above the middle, racemes of erect flowers that are Subtended\nby a calyculus of free bracts, and large, multi-veined tepals that are\nlonger than the stamens and enclose the capsules. The five species of\nIsidrogalvia fall into three groups, which are readily separated using\ncapsule and bract characters: 1. falcata has 3-ribbed capsules and\ncalycular bracts that are longer than wide; I. sessiliflora (comb. nov.)\nand I. robustior (comb. nov.) have incompletely 9-ribbed capsules and\ncalycular bracts that are longer than wide; and I. schomburgkiana (comb.\nnov.) and I. duidae (comb. nov.) have 9-ribbed capsules and calycular\nbracts that are wider than long.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1F","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_548.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1E","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isidrogalvia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_551.phy"}]}
