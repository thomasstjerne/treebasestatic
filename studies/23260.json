Therefore, compiling pieces of evidence from\ndiverse sources of data may be critical for the accurate assessment of\nspecies boundaries in such groups. The increasing availability of DNA\nsequences data allows getting much deeper insight into the understanding\nof diversification and speciation processes and their consequences on\nthe biodiversity. In this study, we applied an integrative approach\nbased on DNA sequences, chemical, geographic, and morphological data,\nand attempted to define species boundaries in the lichen-forming genus\nUsnea (Parmeliaceae), with a particular focus on the U. cornuta\naggregate, a cosmopolitan species group. We provide the first\nmultispecies coalescent (MSC) based species delimitation for this group\nof Usnea species from the Neotropics. Based on ITS rDNA, and the two\nprotein-coding genes RPB1, and Mcm7, we estimated the species tree under\nthe MSC model in a Bayesian framework using STACEY. Our results indicate\nthat at least nine strongly supported distinct lineages coexist in the\nU. cornuta aggregate, each of them being well chemically characterized.\nWe additionally found evidence for the polyphyly of three morphospecies,\nUsnea brasiliensis, U. cornuta and U. dasaea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113908.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113909.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113911.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113912","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113912.phy"}]}
