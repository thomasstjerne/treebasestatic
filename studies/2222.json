Due to their\noften-restricted distribution and the scarcity of modern phylogenetic\nand phylogeographic studies from this region, the phylogenetic position\nand taxonomy of these species are often poorly understood. One example\nis Asyneuma comosiforme, a stenoendemic species known only from the\nShija Gorge in northeastern Albania. Since its description in 1921, the\nposition of this poorly known species within Asyneuma has been\nquestioned. Here, we use nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-trnF DNA sequence\ndata to address the question of the phylogenetic position of this\nenigmatic species. The inferred phylogenies clearly support A.\ncomosiforme as sister to the main clade of isophyllous Campanula\nspecies, which is supported by morphological and ecological\nsimilarities. Thus, a new nomenclatural combination, Campanula\ncomosiformis, is proposed. Given the restricted distribution, this\nspecies should be considered at least vulnerable, but the small\npopulation size might warrant its classification as endangered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanula, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanula, trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3198.phy"}]}
