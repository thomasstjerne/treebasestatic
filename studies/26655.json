The genus Polystichum is\nparticularly rich in polyploids, with 44% of the genus estimated to be\npolyploid. A waypoint between the Andean and Mayan centers of diversity,\nthe Cordillera Talamanca of Costa Rica and Panama harbors three\nallotetraploid species of Polystichum, two of which are endemic to the\nrange. We leverage coding and non-coding DNA sequences from the\nchloroplast and nucleus to elucidate the allopolyploid origins of the\nthree species. Consistent with, and building upon earlier works, we find\nevidence that Polystichum orbiculatum is derived from two distinct\nAndean progenitors, P. lilianiae is derived from two Mayan progenitors,\nand P. talamancanum is derived from one Andean and one Mayan progenitor.\nThe Costa Rican polyploids incorporate the legacy of the Andean and\nMayan regions into their genomes, forming new lineages with novel\ngenotypes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124988","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124988.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124989","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124989.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124990","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124990.phy"}]}
