Single and\nGCPSR approach using sequence of ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) and\nTranslation elongation factor 1alpha encoding (tef1) genes region were\napplied. Phenotypically, these isolates distributed into three sections\nof Trichoderma, i.e. Longibrachiatum, Pachybasidium and Trichoderma\nwhich was supported by the phylogenetic studies. Phylogenetic analyses\nof either single gene or GCPSR approach indicated that 25 isolates can\nbe validly named into species level, however, two other isolates still\nneeded further investigation using other Trichoderma barcode i.e. RNA\npolymerase II gene (RPB2). Of the 25 isolates, eleven isolates\ndetermined as T. harzianum, 5 isolates were T. tawa, three isolates each\ndetermined as T. reseei and T. virens, and the remaining isolates each\nbelong to either T. asperellum, T. atroviride or T. ovalisporum. No\nstrains found being subtrate specific.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 193","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63492.phy"}]}
