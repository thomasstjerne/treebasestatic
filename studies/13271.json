A cladistic analysis of basal birds supports the\nplacement of the new fossil as the sister-taxon of all pygostylians.\nPossessing a unique hand morphology witha phalangel formula of 2-3-3-x-x\nand a reduced number of caudal vertebrae lacking a pygostyle, the new\nspecimen reveals anatomical information previously unknown and increases\nthe taxonomic diversity of primitive non-pygostylian birds. We infer\nfrom the specimen that during the evolution of the avian tail, a\ndecrease in relative caudal length and number of vertebrae preceded the\ndistal fusion of caudals into a pygostyle.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56097.phy"}]}
