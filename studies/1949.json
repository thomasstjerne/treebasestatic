Dissecta\n(Plantaginaceae), which is restricted to the Olympic (S. lanuginosa) and\nNorthern Rocky Mountains (S. dissecta and S. canbyi), to infer effects\nof sky islands and modes of speciation. Sequences of cpDNA trnT-trnL and\npsbA-trnH intergenic spacers resolved 22 haplotypes among 302\nindividuals sampled from 16 populations of the three species. Broad gene\nflow in the ancestral lineage and subsequent random capture of\nhaplotypes in species lineages of sect. Dissecta have resulted in\nhaplotype clades that are not exclusive to species. Allopatric\nfragmentation separated Olympic and Northern Rocky Mountain populations,\ngiving rise to the Olympic endemic S. lanuginosa, which is characterized\nby unique haplotypes consistent with long temporal isolation. Low\nhaplotype and nucleotide diversity in S. canbyi are consistent with\nnewly founded populations experiencing a population bottleneck. We infer\nS. canbyi evolved as a northern peripheral isolate of S. dissecta.\nNested clade analysis indicated limited migration in S. dissecta with\npossible isolation by distance. Populations of this species appear to\nhave been isolated not only on interglacial sky islands, but also during\nat least the last glaciation when valley glaciers prevented gene flow\namong populations in different ranges of the Northern Rocky\nMountains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synthyris sect.
