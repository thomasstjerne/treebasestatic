This fungus is characterized by\nfully immersed ascomata under a small blackened pseudoclypeus,\npseudoparenchymatous peridium, cellular pseudoparaphyses,\ncylindrical-clavate asci with a distinct pedicel, overlapping\n34-seriate, pale to dark brown, broadly fusoid, 79-transversally septate\nascospores with a vertical septum in nearly all median cells. Multigene\nphylogenetic analyses using sequences from partial ITS, SSU and LSU\nnrDNA and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (TEF)\ndemonstrated a monophyletic affiliation of the new strain accommodating\nthe species of Phaeoseptum in the family Phaeoseptaceae. With further\nmorphological and phylogenetic investigations, we justify the new fungus\nas a novel species, Phaeoseptum hydei in Phaeoseptaceae. Detailed\ndescriptions and illustrations are provided for Phaeoseptum hydei and it\nis compared with the remaining species in the genus. An updated\nchecklist of microfungi, recorded on Delonix regia from worldwide\ndistribution is also provided","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122702","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122702.phy"}]}
