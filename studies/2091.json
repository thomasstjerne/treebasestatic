Series Annulares and Turnera are\nmonophyletic, as are Anomalae with the exception of two species with\nunknown fruit and seed morphology. Series Microphyllae and Papilliferae\nshould be merged on one side, and Series Salicifoliae and Stenodictyae\nwith some species of series Capitatae on the other. Series Capitatae is\nnot a natural group, and Series Leiocarpae is unresolved. The T.sidoides\ncomplex should be separated into a new series. The biogeographic\nanalyses show that the major diversification of the genus took place in\nthe Chaquean subregion, with vicariant and dispersal events to the other\nNeotropical subregions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Turnera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5194.phy"}]}
