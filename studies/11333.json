For instance,\nsignal in molecular data from different cellular components, such as\nmitochondrion and nucleus, may be inconsistent. Mammalian studies\nprovide one such case of conflict where mitochondrial data, which\ndisplay compositional biases, support the Marsupionta hypothesis, but\nnuclear data confirm the Theria hypothesis. Most observations of\ncompositional biases in tree reconstruction have focused on the lineages\nwith the ‘unusual’ composition. However in some situations, the position\nof related taxa that lack compositional bias may be influenced due to\napparent symplesiomorphic characters, a situation known as “the\nsymplesiomorphy trap”. Herein, we report an example of the\nsympleisomorphy trap and how to detect it. Terebelliformia worms are\nmainly tube-dwelling annelids comprising five ‘families’: Alvinellidae,\nAmpharetidae, Terebellidae, Trichobranchidae and Pectinariidae. Using\nmitochondrial genomic, as well as nuclear 18S and 28S rDNA and\nelongation factor-1α, we revealed incongruence between mitochondrial and\nnuclear data regarding placement of Trichobranchidae. Mitochondrial data\nfavored a sister relationship between Terebellidae and Trichobranchidae,\nbut nuclear data placed Trichobranchidae as sister to an\nAmpharetidae/Alvinellidae clade. Additional investigations revealed that\nmitochondrial data of Ampharetidae and Alvinellidae exhibited strong\ncompositional biases misplacing Trichobranchidae, rather than\nAlvinellidae and Ampharetidae. Thus, Trichobranchidae was apparently\ncaught in the symplesiomorphy trap.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mtTreeAA","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31349","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31349.phy"},{"tree_label":"28Stree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31338","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31338.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S28S","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31339.phy"},{"tree_label":"comTreeAA","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31355","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31355.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucTree","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31340.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtTree","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31341","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31341.phy"},{"tree_label":"comTree","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31342","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31342.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31336.phy"}]}
