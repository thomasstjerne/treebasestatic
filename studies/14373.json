In contrast to the low copy numbers observed in\nanimals, GSK3 genes have expanded into a multi-gene family in land\nplants (embryophytes), and have also evolved functions in diverse plant\nspecific processes, including floral development in angiosperms.\nHowever, despite previous efforts, the phylogeny of land plant GSK3\ngenes is currently unclear. Here, we analyze genes from a representative\nsample of phylogenetically pivotal taxa, including basal angiosperms,\ngymnosperms, and monilophytes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history\nand functional diversification of the GSK3 gene family in land plants.\nResults Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses resolve a gene tree\nwith four major gene duplication events that coincide with the emergence\nof novel land plant clades. The single GSK3 gene inherited from the\nancestor of land plants was first duplicated along the ancestral branch\nto extant vascular plants, and three subsequent duplications produced\nthree GSK3 loci in the ancestor of euphyllophytes, four in the ancestor\nof seed plants, and at least five in the ancestor of angiosperms. A\nsingle gene in the Amborella trichopoda genome may be the sole survivor\nof a sixth GSK3 locus that originated in the ancestor of extant\nangiosperms. Homologs of two Arabidopsis GSK3 genes with genetically\nconfirmed roles in floral development, AtSK11 and AtSK12, exhibit floral\npreferential expression in several basal angiosperms, suggesting\nevolutionary conservation of their floral functions. Members of other\ngene lineages appear to have independently evolved roles in plant\nreproductive tissues in individual taxa. Conclusions Our phylogenetic\nanalyses provide the most detailed reconstruction of GSK3 gene evolution\nin land plants to date and offer new insights into the origins,\nrelationships, and functions of family members. Notably, the diversity\nof this “green” branch of the gene family has increased in concert with\nthe increasing morphological and physiological complexity of land plant\nlife forms. Expression data for seed plants indicate that the functions\nof GSK3 genes have also diversified during evolutionary time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"GSK3","ntax":"445","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Land Plant GSK3 matrix","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65393.phy"}]}
