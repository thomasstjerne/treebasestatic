The main objectives of this\nstudy were to identify the causal agent using multilocus molecular\nphylogenetics and to complete Kochs postulates. Maximum likelihood and\nmaximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses of portions of translation\nelongation factor 1-α (TEF1), DNA-directed RNA polymerase II largest\n(RPB1) and second largest subunit (RPB2) indicated that the Hibiscus\npathogen was a novel, undescribed Fusarium species nested within the F.\nbuharicum species complex (FBSC). Results of the pathogenicity\nexperiments demonstrated that the novel Fusarium sp. could induce\nvascular wilt, root and crown rot symptoms on H. moscheutos cultivar\nLuna Rose.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hibiscus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96424.phy"}]}
