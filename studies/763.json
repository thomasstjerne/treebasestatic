Their phylogenetic relationships with another 36 species in\nPleosporaceae in GenBank were analyzed by parsimony and distance\nmethods. These two methods positioned filament-beaked Alternaria as a\nmonophyletic group discrete from the other members in genus Alternaria.\nA hypothesis proposing the filament-beaked species of Alternaria evolved\na particular evolutionary route distinguishable from other species based\non molecular evidence, the unique traits of morphological adaptation for\nliberation, their subsistent strategies and the distinctive morphology\nof their teleomorphs has been discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3837.phy"}]}
