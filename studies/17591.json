P. purpureofuscus is characterized by the\npurple-brown colors of pileus, presence of clamp-connections, and\nhabitat on coniferous wood. P. griseodiscus is characterized by the pale\ncolors of the basidiocarps, non-pigmented lamellar edges, thick-walled\ncheilocystidia and the presence of caulocystidia. The phylogenetic\nposition of both species, based on nrITS data is also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus nrITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100535.phy"}]}
