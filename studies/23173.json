The taxon is morphologically\ndistinct from other known melanommataceous taxa based on its unique set\nof characters, such as superficial to erumpent, uniloculate conidiomata\nand globose ellipsoidal or ovoid, dark-brown, multiseptate conidia. It\nis introduced herein as Melanocamarosporioides ugamica gen. et sp. nov.\nwithin the family Melanommataceae. Multiloci phylogenies based on LSU,\nSSU, ITS and TEF1-α sequence data generated from maximum likelihood,\nmaximum parsimony and MrBayes analyses indicate that M. ugamica forms a\ndistinct lineage within Melanommataceae and its establishment as a new\ngenus is supported.
