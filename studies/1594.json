Trees\nwere inferred with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo, neighbor-joining\nand maximum parsimony methods and rooted with Perofascia. The results\nare discussed with respect to host taxonomy and species concepts of\ndowny mildews from the literature. Molecular data mainly support the use\nof narrow species delimitations and host range as a taxonomic marker.\nHyaloperonospora brassicae turns out to be a non-monophyletic assemblage\nof different species. New combinations are proposed in accordance with\nthe phylogenetic trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ TVM I G","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4650.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB MCMC GTR I G","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4651.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4649.phy"}]}
