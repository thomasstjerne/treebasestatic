Evidences based in molecular\nidentification of root tips have suggested the existence of undescribed\nspecies in the Nothofagus forests of Patagonia, Argentina. Tomentella\ntenuissima, T. pulvinulata, and T. patagonica are described as new\nspecies based on morphological and molecular analyses and their host\nrange is addressed using available soil sequences. The identity of\nprevious records of T. galzinii and T. radiosa are discussed with\nmorphological and molecular evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95132","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95132.phy"}]}
