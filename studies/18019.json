Cryptosphaeria\npullmanensis is reported from a wide geographic area in the western\nUnited States on the main host P. fremontii. The pathogen C. lignyota is\nreported for the first time from the Sierra Nevada of California on P.\ntremuloides. The phylogenetic analyses showed that C. multicontinentalis\nis a sister species to C. lignyota. Both species were closely related to\nC. subcutanea and more distantly related to C. pullmanensis.\nCharacteristics of both teleomorph and anamorph of the newly introduced\nspecies C. multicontinentalis are described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106985.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106986.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106984.phy"}]}
