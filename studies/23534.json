They are characterized by having the unicellular\nand erected spinose pilesetae on the surface of pileipellis. The two new\nspecies (M. turandotiana and M. fengguans) have their pileocystidia\noriginated from hyphae of the pileipellis and have thin-walled\npileocystidia. While the new record (M. brunneisetosa) has thick-walled\npileocystia. Phylogenetic analyses support that the spinose structures\nin those of Mycena resulted from convergent evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PhyML black31","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114662.phy"},{"tree_label":"Spino 31 BI","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114665.phy"}]}
