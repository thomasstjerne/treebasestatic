It consisted of 8,914\nnucleotides (nt) encoding a single open reading frame of 8,640 nts in\nthe viral-complementary sense. The ORF potentially codes for\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 330.9 kDa. Two untranslated\nregions of 241 and 33 nucleotides were present at the 5 and 3 termini,\nrespectively that shared conserved tospoviral sequences. Phylogenetic\nanalysis using nucleotide sequences of the complete L RNA showed that\nTSWV WA-USA isolate clustered with the American and Asian TSWV isolates\nwhich formed a distinct clade from Euro-Asiatic tospoviruses. Phylogeny\nof the amino acid sequence of all tospoviral RdRps used in this study\nshowed that all the known TSWV isolates including the USA isolate\ndescribed in this study formed a distinct and a close cluster with that\nof Impateins necrotic spot virus. Multiple sequence alignment revealed\nconserved motifs in the RdRp of TSWV. Recombination analysis identified\ntwo recombinants including the TSWV WA-USA isolate. Among them, three\nrecombination events were detected in the conserved motifs of the\nRdRp.This is the first report of the complete L RNA sequence of TSWV\nfrom the USA. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the L RNA\nshowed distinct clustering with selected TSWV isolates reported from\nelsewhere. Conserved motifs in the core polymerase region of the RdRp\nand recombination events were identified","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93870.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93869","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93869.phy"}]}
