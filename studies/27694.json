B. ecuadorensis is characterised by dark gray to black pore\nsurface, a monomitic hyphal system, hyaline to yellowish-brown\ngenerative hyphae, snd ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 3.94.5 × 2.73\nμm. B. fulgida is distinguished from the other species in the genus by\nclay buff to pale brown and glancing pore surface. B. minispora is\ncharacterised by white tomentose pore mouth and small basidiospores\nmeasuring 3.14.2 × 22.8 μm. B. resupinata is characterised by resupinate\nbasidiocarps, pinkish buff to pale brownish pore surface, and ellipsoid\nto broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.56 × 3.24.1 µm. The\nclosely related taxa to four new species are discussed. An\nidentification key to then ten accepted species of Bjerkandera is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bjerkandera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132737.phy"}]}
