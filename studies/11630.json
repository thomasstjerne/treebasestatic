It is also closely\nassociated with infestation by the non-native wood boring beetle\nHypocryphalus mangiferae (Coleoptera: Scolytinae). The aim of this study\nwas to characterize Ceratocystis isolates obtained from diseased mango\ntrees in Brazil. Identification was based on sequence data for the\nInternal Transcribed Spacer region 1 and 2 including the 5.8S rRNA\noperon, part of the Beta-tubulin 1 gene and part of the Transcription\nElongation Factor 1-alpha gene. The isolates from Brazil grouped in two\nwell defined and unique clades within C. fimbriata s.l. These were also\ndistinct from C. manginecans that causes a similar disease associated\nwith H. mangiferae in Oman and Pakistan. Based on sequence comparisons\nand morphological characteristics, isolates representing the two\nphylogenetic clades are described as C. mangicola sp. nov. and C.\nmangivora sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"paup 4","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46880","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46880.phy"},{"tree_label":"paup
