The origins of these giant ceratopsids, the\nTriceratopsini, are poorlyunderstood. This paper describes\nTitanoceratops ouranos, a giant ceratopsid fromthe lateCampanian\n(73e74Ma) of NewMexico, and the earliest known triceratopsin. The\nholotypewas previously interpreted as an aberrant and exceptionally\nlarge specimen of Pentaceratops sternbergi, but the animal does not show\nthe diagnostic features of Pentaceratops. Instead, cladistic analysis\nshows that Titanoceratops is the sister taxon of a clade formed by\nEotriceratops, Triceratops, and Torosaurus. With an estimated mass of\n6.5 tons, Titanoceratops is among the largest dinosaurs known from the\nCampanian of North America, and rivaled Triceratops in size. The\nrecognition of Titanoceratops suggests that giant chasmosaurines evolved\nonce, among the Triceratopsini, and that the group evolved large size\nfive million years earlier than previously thought. The giant horned\ndinosaurs probably originated in the southern part of the North American\ncontinent during the Campanian but only became widespread during the\nMaastrichtian.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 11","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55335.phy"}]}
