Grasses also include the three most important crops in the\nworld (wheat, maize, rice) and several productive species with great\nbiofuel potential (Byrt et al., 2011). Many grass lineages have evolved\nC4 photosynthesis, a complex and coordinated set of anatomical and\nbiochemical modifications that act to concentrate CO2 at the site of\nfixation by Rubisco during the Calvin cycle (Sage, 2004; Edwards et al.,\n2010). The direct effect of the C4 pathway is to reduce photorespiration\nand saturate photosynthesis with CO2, which has allowed C4 grasses to\ncolonize open and drier habitats in tropical and subtropical regions\n(Osborne & Freckleton, 2009; Edwards & Smith, 2010). Extant C4\ngrass diversity is upwards of 4500 species, and C4 grasses dominate many\nimportant ecosystems and contribute 20-25% of terrestrial primary\nproductivity (Still et al., 2003).","trees":[{"tree_label":"gpwg2 Bayesian consensus tree","ntax":"545","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Grass Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_48905.phy"}]}
