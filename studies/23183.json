Despite this immense value, the circumscription of the\ngenus Saccharum is complex, contentious, and largely unresolved.\nSaccharum is either accepted in a broad sense by some authors or split\ninto various genera such as Erianthus and Tripidium by others. A\nplastome phylogenomic analysis of sugarcane and relatives was performed\nin order to investigate generic delimitation, with emphasis on Tripidium\n(= Erianthus sect. Ripidium). Our plastome analysis demonstrates that\nSaccharum s.l. is polyphyletic and Tripidium (distributed in the Old\nWorld) belongs to a distinct lineage from Saccharum s.s. (Old World) and\nErianthus s.s. (= Erianthus sect. Erianthus, New World). Therefore, this\nstudy confirms the recognition of Tripidium as a genus distinct from\nSaccharum and Erianthus, which is also supported by morphology and\nnuclear markers. The circumscription of Erianthus s.s. remains unclear\nsince our results are consistent with either considering it as a\ndistinct genus or including it in Saccharum. Better understanding of the\nevolutionary relationships of sugarcane and relatives may be useful for\nthe selection of potential taxa for interspecific and intergeneric\ncrosses in the genetic improvement of sugarcane. A taxonomic treatment\nof the six species of Tripidium is also presented, including\ndescriptions, illustrations, data on geographical distribution, and\nthree new nomenclatural combinations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115603","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115603.phy"}]}
