The relationship\nbetween species co-evolution was analyzed by using the connection\nmethod, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and comparative analysis\nof topology. From 97 termites nests that were collected from the Yunnan\nProvince, we extracted 1 sample of Termitomyces and fungus-growing\ntermites from each nest. The results indicated that termites have no\nobvious preference for the type of Termitomyces and the variation of\nTermitomyces that were symbiotic with the same termites species was up\nto 99.86 percent, the similarity of phylogenetic topology between\nTermitomyces and fungus-growing termites was only 28 percent, the\nfrequency of cospeciations events between Termitomyces and\nfungus-growing termites was 0, Few coevolution relationships were\nobserved between termite mushrooms and termites from Yunnan\nprovince.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75846","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75846.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75845","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75845.phy"}]}
