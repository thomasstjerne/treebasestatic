Samples of these species were mostly collected from\ndeciduous or mixed forests with oaks. Lactarius albidocinereus, a member\nof L. subg. Plinthogalus is very similar to European L. azonites in the\nmorphology and the sequence data. It differs from L. azonites by more\nellipsoid spores with thinner ornamentation and shorter terminal cells\nin the pileipellis. Lactarius dilutisalmoneus belongs to L. sect.\nZonarii of L. subg. Lactarius due to the pale salmoneus subzonate pileus\nwith glabrous margin, unchanging latex and spore ornamentation composed\nof isolated elements. In comparison with its relatives, i.e.Â European L.\nzonarioides and North American L. olympianus, this new species has\nsmaller spores with more prominent ornamentation. Lactarius\nolivaceorimosellus, a member of L. subg. Russularia, has\nareolate-rimulose pileus and lacks rosettes in the pileus and stipe\ncortex. Apart from the concentrically cracked pileus and absence of\nrosettes, the species can be easily distinguished by the\nolivaceo-brownish tinge of the pileus and spores with more dispersed\nelements of the ornamentation. Of the three species, at least L.\nalbidocinereus represents a link with the Lactarius mycota of\nsubtropical China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122976.phy"}]}
