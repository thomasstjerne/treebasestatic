Studies reconstructing\nthe history of this group have by and large relied on datasets of one to\na few genes for phylogenetic inference and ancestral character state\nreconstruction. As a result, volvocine phylogenies lack concordance\ndepending on the number and/or type of genes (i.e., chloroplast vs\nnuclear) chosen for phylogenetic inference. While multiple studies\nsuggest that multicellularity evolved only once in the volvocine algae,\nthat each of its three colonial families is monophyletic, and that there\nhave been at least three independent origins of cellular differentiation\nin the group, other studies call into question one or more of these\nconclusions. An accurate assessment of the evolutionary history of the\nvolvocine algae requires inference of a more robust phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
