Our inability to decipher\nnatural lineages of cheilanthoids has been attributed to morphological\nconvergence associated with adaptation to xeric environments. The goal\nof this study was to investigate the monophyly of the genus Pellaea by\ngenerating a DNA sequence-based cheilanthoid phylogeny. DNA sequences of\nthe chloroplast rps4 gene and rps4-trnS intergenic spacer (IGS) were\nused from 105 exemplars, 60 of these were also employed to generate\nchloroplast trnL-F IGS sequences. Results show that Pellaea sensu Tryon\nand Tryon is polyphyletic; Pellaea sections Holcochlaena and Ormopteris\nare distant relatives of sections Pellaea and Platyloma and have closer\nrelationships with Doryopteris. A monophyletic circumscription of\n“pellaeoid” ferns is here defined to include P. sect. Pellaea, P. sect.\nPlatyloma, Astrolepis, and elements of Paragymnopteris and Paraceterach,\nall of which form a clade sister to Argyrochosma. The distribution of\nbase chromosome numbers across the cheilanthoid phylogeny reveals\npotential synapomorphies of x = 29 for the pellaeoid clade and x = 27\nfor Argyrochosma, and suggests a trend toward reduction in base number\nduring cheilanthoid evolution. Current geographic distribution of\ncheilanthoid ferns suggests a history of multiple introductions into the\nOld World from several New World ancestral lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cheilanthoid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4780.phy"}]}
