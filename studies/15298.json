To date, only S. tanaceti has been identified in\nAustralia, incurring substantial losses to the pyrethrum industry. In\ncontrast to the homothallic S. chrysanthemi and S. inoxydabilis, a\nsexual state has not been observed for S. tanaceti. The MAT1 locus in S.\ntanaceti was identified through de novo assembly of shotgun reads, and\nwas further used to develop primers for amplification of the full-length\nMAT1/2 locus in S. chrysanthemi and S. inoxydabilis. As expected, S.\nchrysanthemi and S. inoxydabilis possessed a MAT1/2 locus typical of\nhomothallic Dothideomycetes with two adjacent MAT1-1 and MAT1-2\nidiomorphs. However, only MAT1-1 could be detected in the assembled\ngenome of S. tanaceti. Although a sexual mode of reproduction cannot be\nruled out for S. tanaceti, evidence so far suggests this is absent or\noccurring at very low frequencyin Australian pyrethrum fields.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleosporales MAT1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70288.phy"}]}
