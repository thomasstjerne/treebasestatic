A new species of\ntruffle, Tuber pulchrosporum, is described from Greece and Bulgaria.\nSpecimens were collected from habitats dominated by various oak species\n(i.e.Â Quercus ilex, Q.coccifera, Q.robur) and other angiosperms. They\nare morphologically characterised by subglobose, ovoid to irregularly\nlobed, yellowish-brown to dark brown ascomata, usually with a shallow\nbasal cavity and surface with fissures and small, dense, almost flat,\ntrihedral to polyhedral warts. Ascospores are ellipsoid to subfusiform,\nuniquely ornamented, crested to incompletely reticulate and are produced\nin (1-)2-8-spored asci. Hair-like, hyaline to light yellow hyphae\nprotrude from the peridium surface. According to the outcome of ITS rDNA\nsequence analysis, this species forms a distinct well-supported group in\nthe Aestivum clade, with T. panniferum being the closest phylogenetic\ntaxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130599.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130598.phy"}]}
