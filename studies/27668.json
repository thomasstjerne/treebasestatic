In the phylogeny, the new species is\nclosely related to C. viscosa and C. cornea based on ITS sequences, but\nC. viscosa has basidioma with sharp tips, pale yellow, 1-septate mature\nbasidiospores; C. cornea has cylindrical, subulate, slightly branched\nbasidioma, tinted, cylindrical to slightly curved-cylindrical, 1-septate\nmature basidiospores measuring 710 × 34.5 μm. The new species is unique\nby its 34-septate mature basidiospores among species of Calocera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calocera tibetica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132617.phy"}]}
