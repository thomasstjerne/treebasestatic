The lack of a suitable taxonomic framework and\nphylogenetic inconsistencies have long hampered Escovopsis research. The\naim of this study is to reassess the genus Escovopsis using a taxonomic\napproach and a comprehensive multilocus phylogenetic analysis, in order\nto set the basis of the genus systematics and the stage for future\nEscovopsis research. Our results support the separation of Escovopsis\ninto three distinct genera. In light of this, we redefine Escovopsis as\na monophyletic clade whose main feature is to form terminal vesicles on\nconidiophores. Consequently, E. kreiselii and E. trichodermoides were\nrecombined into two new genera, Sympodiorosea and Luteomyces, as S.\nkreiselii and L. trichodermoides, respectively. This study expands our\nunderstanding of the systematics of Escovopsis and related genera,\nthereby facilitating future research on the evolutionary history,\ntaxonomic diversity, and ecological roles of these inhabitants of the\nattine ant colonies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood Tree (LSU) at the Family level (Fig\n3B)","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic placement
