A\nclose relationship between the floras of the two regions has been\nsuggested, but patterns of biogeographical connections between them are\npoorly understood. The genus Dracocephalum is most diverse in the\nsteppe-desert biomes of the Asian interior and the alpine region of the\nQTP, making the genus an ideal group to explore the biogeographical\nconnections between the Asian interior and QTP. Using a total of 66 taxa\ncomprising more than 80% of extant Dracocephalum species, we\ninvestigated the evolutionary history of Dracocephalum by performing\nmorphological, phylogenetic (maximum parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian\ninference based on nuclear ITS and ETS, plastid rpl32-trnL, trnL-trnF,\nycf1, ycf1-rps15, and two low-copy nuclear [AT3G09060 and AT1G09680]\nmarkers), divergence time, and ancestral range estimation analyses. The\ngenus originated in Central/West Asia and southern Siberia around 16.32\n(10.9821.99) Ma and dispersed from Central/West Asia into the QTP region\ntwice independently during the Pliocene. The aridification of the Asian\ninterior promoted the rapid radiation of Dracocephalum within this\nregion, and the uplift of the QTP appears to have triggered the\ndispersal and recent rapid diversification of the genus in the QTP and\nadjacent regions. All analyses indicated that Hyssopus and Lallemantia\nshould be included within Dracocephalum. Thus, we propose a broadly\ncircumscribed Dracocephalum divided into nine sections based on\nmolecular phylogenetic and morphological evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134729","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134729.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134731","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134731.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134730","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134730.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134732","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134732.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134733","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134733.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134734.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134735.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134736.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134737","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134737.phy"}]}
