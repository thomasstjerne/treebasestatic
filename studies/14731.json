They provide an unparalleled opportunity\nfor studying marine biogeography because they include the globally\ndistributed families Tripterygiidae (triplefin blennies) and Blenniidae\n(combtooth blennies), the temperate Clinidae (kelp blennies), and three\nlargely Neotropical families (Labrisomidae, Chaenopsidae, and\nDactyloscopidae). However, interpretation of these distributional\npatterns has been hindered by largely unresolved inter-familial\nrelationships and the lack of evidence of monophyly of the\nLabrisomidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Blenniiformes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66723.phy"}]}
