The etiology of this disease, including its main\nagents, is still incompletely known. This trunk rot was previously\nattributed to Fomitiporia (Phellinus) hartigii or F. (Phellinus)\npunctata. Here, we phylogenetically analyzed DNA sequences of four\nmarkers from a set of strains isolated from trunk rot symptoms and\nrecovered a single, monophyletic clade, indicating that a single taxon\nis involved. This clade was identified as Fomitiporia torreyae, a\nspecies described from eastern China. This analysis also proved that\ntrunk rot and/or dieback of other conifers and broad-leaf trees,\nincluding Sawara cypress (Chamaecyparis pisifera), Japanese umbrella\npine (Sciadopitys verticillata), and Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia var.\nculta), were caused by the same species. The phylogenetic approach to\nFomitiporia revealed that the F. torreyae clade was closely related to\nF. bannaensis, but clearly distinct from F. punctata, which was\noriginally thought to be the cause of trunk rot in Sanbu-sugi.\nFomitiporia torreyae is re-described on the basis of more than 40\nspecimens from multiple hosts from Japan and China. Fomitiporia\njuniperina comb. nov. is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Phylogeny of Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_72546.phy"}]}
