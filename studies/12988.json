The fungus\nproduced perithecia in culture requiring an opposite mating idiomorph\nisolate in a heterothallic manner. The initial infection strategy on\npyrethrum leaves involved the formation of appressoria followed by\nproduction of multi-lobed infection vesicles in the epidermal cells\nwhich was suggestive of a hemibiotrophic infection strategy. Infection\nand colonization then proceeded through secondary hyphae, which resulted\nin the initial production of water-soaked lesions followed by black\nnecrotic lesions. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that C.\ntanaceti was closely related to C. destructivum, C. higginsianum and C.\npanacicola that also have similar intracellular hemibiotrophic infection\nstrategies. Anthracnose is likely to contribute to the complex of foliar\ndiseases reducing green leaf area in pyrethrum fields in Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum tanaceti sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62095.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum tanaceti sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum tanaceti sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62116.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum tanaceti sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62094.phy"}]}
