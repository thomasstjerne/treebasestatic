Here we use data based on\ntwo nuclear and three plastid DNA regions to presentone of the most\ncomprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions of a genus in Cyperaceae to\ndate, covering over 70% of described species of Schoenus. After recent\ntaxonomic realignments in the last four years have both added and\nremoved species from the genus, we show that Schoenus is now\nmonophyletic and is composed of two major clades. In addition, our\nresults indicate that Schoenus originated in Western Australia in the\nPaleocene and eventually dispersed to surrounding continents, but rarely\nback. The diversification rate of the genus appears to have slightly\ndecreased over time, and there has not been an increase associated with\nthe establishment of the Cape clade endemic to the sclerophyllous fynbos\nvegetation type, such as has been reported in other plant lineages\nendemic to the Cape region. These results will serve as a template to\nunderstanding the complex patterns of genome size evolution and to\nuntangle drivers of diversification in this genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
