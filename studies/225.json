{"Authors":" Anders S Barfod","Year":" 1991","Title":" A monographic study of the subfamily Phytelephantoideae\n(Arecaceae).","Journal":" Opera Botanica","Volume":" 105","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 1-73","Keywords":" NA","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" The subfamily Phytelephantoideae forms a separate\nevolutionary line distinguished within the palm family by a number of\nunusual features: monopodial flower clusters. strongly dimorphic\nflowers, four-parted perianth whorls and centrifugal stamen initiation.\nThis study describes a new genus and places the former genus Palandra in\nsynonomy under Phytelephas. Three genera, seven species and five\nsubspecies are recognized: Ammandra dasyneura, Ammandra decasperma,a\nAphandra natalia, Phytelephas aequatorialis, Phytelephas macrocarpa,\nPhytelephas macrocarpa ssp. schottii, Phytelephas macrocarpa ssp.\ntenui-caulis, Phytelephas seemannii, Phytelephas seemannii ssp.\nbrevipes, Phytelephas tumacana. The monograph contains a broad\ndiscussion of the character complexes that are emphasized in the\ndefinition of taxa. Aspects of reproductive biology and ecology are\ntreated. A cladistic analysis of the species relationship is presented\nand the results further interpreted in relation to biogeography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytelephantoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4313.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 16B","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytelephantoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4311.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytelephantoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4312.phy"}]}
