Endophytic Pestalotiopsis and Neopestalotiopsis\nspecies were isolated from Dendrobium cariniferum, D. loddigesii and two\nunidentified orchid species sampled in southwestern China and northern\nThailand. Morphological and molecular comparison identified the isolates\nas two new species; Neopestalotiopsis dendrobii, and Pestalotiopsis\ndoitungensis; two existing species P. lushanensis and P.\ntrachicarpicola. This is the first report of Neopestalotiopsis isolated\nfrom the orchid genus Dendrobium and is the first report of pestalotiod\nfungi in D. careniferum. Pestalotiopsis lushanensis and P.\ntrachicarpicola are new recorded fungal endophytes in Dendrobium\norchids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116246.phy"}]}
