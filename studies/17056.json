It can be characterized as:\nbrown to gray-orange viscid pileus (that turning olive or bright green\nthen brown with KOH) with regular or irregularly interrupted velar\nremnants at margin; brown-orange to gray-brown pore surface that becomes\nblue-gray after bruising; reticulum on stipe surface above the\npersistent annulus; context (in pileus) white that becoming yellowish\nwhite or pale orange to darker after exposure when young but, brownish\nwhen mature and mostly with pale lavender over the tubes, turning olive\nbrown to olive gray brown with FeSO4, light brown or pink orange with\nKOH; brown spore print; basidiospores 7.812.5 × 3.55.0 µm; cystidia (in\ntube) single on in clusters, mostly brown pigmented, nonencrusted;\nixocutis pattern of pileipellis; caulocystidia single or in clusters.\nDetailed macro- and micromorphological features coupled with the\ncultural behavior and illustrations are given. Its relation with the\nallied taxa is discussed along with its placement in a phylogenetic\ntree.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Suillus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97437.phy"}]}
