Phylogenetic analyses were based on sequences of the\nnuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and large\nsubunit (nrLSU), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2)\nregions. Our multigene phylogeny strongly supports the new taxon in\nClitolyophyllum as a sister species to Clitolyophyllum akcaabatense, a\nspecies only known from Turkey. Fruiting bodies were found fruiting on\nthe ground in a forest of Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii and\nare clitocyboid, becoming flabellate, pinkish white to greyish red, with\npale grey flesh and ellipsoid, hyaline, non-dextrinoid and non-amyloid\nbasidiospores. Basidiospores of Clitolyophyllum wutaishanense are\nslightly longer and wider (7.69.9  4.15.4 m, averaging 8.5  4.7 m,\nwith average length/width ratio of 1.8) than those of Clitolyophyllum\nakcaabatense (6.08.0 × 3.55 m), but with similar shape. In addition,\nthese two species can be distinguished by their nrITS, nrLSU and RPB2\nsequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135066.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135067","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135067.phy"}]}
