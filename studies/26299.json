Two coelomycetous taxa belonging\nto two different genera in Xylariomycetidae, Sordariomycetes, namely\nDiscosia and Sporocadus, were identified. Multi-locus phylogenies based\non the nuclear ribosomal large subunit sequence (LSU), Internal\nTranscribed Spacer (ITS) and Î²-tubulin (tub2) revealed that the Discosia\nspecies is basal to D. fraxinea and D. neofraxinea and forms an\nindependent lineage. The latter is also different from other Discosia\nspecies and characterized by unilocular to bilocular, superficial and\napplanate conidiomata along with elongate-ampulliform conidiogenous\ncells attenuated at the base and conidia smaller in size. Therefore, it\nis introduced as a new species, Discosia ravennica. Our second taxon\ncollected is a new host record from Italy and morphological observations\ncoupled with multigene phylogeny also support that it is Sporocadus\nrosigena. Descriptions, illustrations and molecular data for both\nspecies are provided in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123694","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123694.phy"}]}
