southwestern China, an undescribed Phellodon species was discovered\nbased on the combination of morphological and molecular evidence.\nPhellodon cinereofuscus sp. nov. is distinguished from other taxa in the\ngenus by glabrous pileus and stipe, moderately long spines, the presence\nof clamp connections in the outer layer of stipe, and subglobose to\nglobose, echinulate basidiospores measuring as 3.54.5 × 34.2 µm.\nDetailed description, illustration and phylogenetic analysis inferred\nfrom the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for the new taxa are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
