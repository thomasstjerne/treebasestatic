Despite\ntheir prevalence and pivotal ecological role as filter feeders,\nknowledge of the evolutionary history of sponges is in its infancy.\nHere, we provide the first molecular analysis targeting the evolution of\nsponges from Lake Tanganyika. Independent markers indicate the\noccurrence of several colonization events, which have shaped the current\nlacustrine sponge biodiversity. This is in contrast to a range of\npreviously studied organisms that have diversified within the lake from\nsingle lineages. Our tree reconstructions indicate the presence of two\ngenera, Oncosclera and Eunapius, which are globally distributed.\nTherefore, we reject the hypothesis of monophyly for the sponges from\nLake Tanganyika and challenge existing higher taxonomic structure for\nfreshwater sponges.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lake Tanganyika Freshwater Sponges","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44958.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lake Tanganyika Freshwater Sponges","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44959.phy"}]}
