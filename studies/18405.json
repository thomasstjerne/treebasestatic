This study investigates yellow\nchanterelles in the Midwest using phylogenetic analysis of three DNA\nregions: nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 28S sequences\nand translation elongation factor 1a gene (EF1a). This analysis reveals\na locally common taxon Cantharellus chicagoensis sp. nov. as distinct\nfrom sympatric species present in northeastern Illinois, northwestern\nIndiana and Wisconsin. This chanterelle features a pileus that often has\na greenish yellow margin when immature, a squamulose disk when mature, a\nyellow spore print and the absence of a fragrant odor. Multiple\nCantharellus specimens group with C. flavus and C. phasmatis, expanding\ntheir known range, and others with C. roseocanus. Our observations\nhighlight the diversity of Cantharellus in midwestern USA and further\ndocument the need for additional systematic focus on the regionÂ’s\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leacock Cantharellus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91363.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leacock Cantharellus 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91370.phy"},{"tree_label":"ef1a","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus ef1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91381.phy"}]}
