Tamarillo is a crop of relevance in\nSouth America. Several Colletotrichum species have been reported causing\nanthracnose on tamarillo from Colombia, however not yet in Brazil.\nTamarillo fruits showing anthracnose disease were observed in Viçosa,\nMinas Gerais state, Brazil. This study aimed to determine the causal\nagent of this disease, using sequence‑based phylogeny, colony\ncharacterization, and morphology analyses. The rDNA-ITS, actin,\nbeta-tubulin, chitin synthase 1, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase, and histone loci were amplified by PCR. PCR products were\npurified and sequenced. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that the\nisolates of this study belong to the Colletotrichum boninense species\ncomplex, i.e., Colletotrichum karsti. As far as we know, this is the\nfirst report of C. karsti causing fruit anthracnose on tamarillo in\nBrazil. This study contributes to the knowledge about the etiology of\nfruit anthracnose on tamarillo in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Boninense Multilocus phylogenetic tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134081.phy"}]}
