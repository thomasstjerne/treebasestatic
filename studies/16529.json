Phylogenetic relationships within\nLagenophora were inferred using nuclear and plastid DNA regions.\nReconstruction of spatio-temporal evolution was estimated using\nparsimony, Bayesian inference and likelihood methods, a Bayesian relaxed\nmolecular clock, and ancestral area and habitat reconstructions. Our\nresults support a narrow taxonomic concept of Lagenophora including only\na core group of species with one clade diversifying in New Zealand and\nanother in South America. The split between the New Zealand and South\nAmerican Lagenophora dates from 11.2 Ma (6.1-17.4 95% HPD). The inferred\nancestral habitats were openings in beech forest and subalpine\ntussockland. The biogeographical analyses inferred a complex ancestral\narea for Lagenophora involving New Zealand and southern South America.\nThus, the estimated divergence times and biogeographical reconstructions\nprovide circumstantial evidence that Antarctica may have served as a\ncorridor for migration until the expansion of the continental ice during\nthe late Cenozoic. The extant distribution of Lagenophora reflects a\ncomplex history that could also involve direct long-distance dispersal\nacross southern oceans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagenophora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78470.phy"}]}
