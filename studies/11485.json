The species is macroscopically characterized by its dark\npileus and stipe and by its distant and whitish lamellae with blackish\nto blackish-brown edges. A molecular phylogenetic analyses based on ITS\nand LSU nucDNA sequences confirms the delimitation of this new taxon and\nplaces L. fuscomarginatus in subgenus Gerardii (A.H. Sm. & Hesler)\nStubbe.
