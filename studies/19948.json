This\nincluded genes for 34 distinct ion channel types, 17 biogenic amine and\n5 GABA receptors, 28 major transmitter receptor subtypes including\nglutamate and acetylcholine receptors, and 6 gap junction proteins - the\nInnexins. With this resource, crustacean model systems are better poised\nfor incorporation of modern genomic and molecular biology technologies\nto further enhance the interrogation of fundamentals of nervous system\nfunction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cb-Ha Innexin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101034.phy"}]}
