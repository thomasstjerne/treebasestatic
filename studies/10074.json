It was collected in a timberline area of Mt Fuji,\nJapan. Specimens were found on trunks of Rhododendron sp. Morphological\nstudy and phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data derived from LSU\nnrDNA indicated that Neoaleurodiscus is separate from other segregate\ngenera from Aleurodiscus s.l. Neoaleurodiscus is characterized by having\na disciform basidiocarp; microscopically it has moniliform\ngloeocystidia, absence of acanthophyses, nodose-septate hyphae,\nhyphidia, and basidiospores, which are amyloid, smooth and ยกร\nthick-walled. Among genera studied, Acanthobasidium and Aleurodiscus\n(s.s.) are most closely related to Neoaleurodiscus, but these two genera\nhave warted or spiny basidiospores. Two new combinations,\nAcanthobasidium penicillatum and Neoaleurodiscus monilifer, are\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neoaleurodiscus fujii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6080.phy"}]}
