These 11 genera included Astrocystis,\nAmphirosellinia, Discoxylaria, Entoleuca, Euepixylon, Kretzschmaria,\nNemania, Podosordaria, Poronia, Rosellinia, and Stilbohypoxylon. We\nshowed that Xylaria species were distributed among three major clades,\nTE, HY, and PO, with clade TEâan equivalent of the subgenus\nPseudoxylariaâencompassing exclusively those species associated with\ntermite nests and the other two clades containing those associated with\nsubstrates other than termite nests. Xylaria appears to be a\nparaphyletic genus, with most of the 11 genera submerged within it.\nPodosordaria and Poronia, which formed a distinct clade, apparently\ndiverged from Xylaria and the other genera early. Species of Entoleuca,\nEuepixylon, Nemania, and Rosellinia constituted clade NR, a major clade\nsister to clade PO, while those of Kretzschmaria were inserted within\nclade HY and those of Astrocystis, Amphirosellinia, Discoxylaria, and\nStilbohypoxylon were within clade PO.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylaria subgenus Pseudoxylaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60086.phy"},{"tree_label":"MBT","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylaria subgenus Pseudoxylaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60085.phy"}]}
