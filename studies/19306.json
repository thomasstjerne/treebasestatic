In all, 45 Botryosphaeriaceae isolates were collected\nand characterized based on phenotypical features and comparisons of DNA\nsequence data of the nuclear ribosomal DNA-internal transcribed spacer\nregion and elongation factor 1-α gene. Five species were identified as\nDiplodia olivarum, D. seriata, Neofusicoccum luteum, N. mediterraneum,\nand N. parvum. Pathogenicity tests were performed on four cultivars\n(‘Pons’, ‘Vivot’, ‘Jordi’, and ‘Ferragnes’) under field conditions for\ntwo consecutive years (2013 to 2014), and confirmed that all five\nspecies cause canker and dieback of almond, with Neofusicoccum spp. more\nvirulent than Diplodia spp. in both years. Jordi was less sensitive to\nfungal infection in 2013. First reports from almond in Spain include N.\nmediterraneum and N. luteum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96071.phy"}]}
