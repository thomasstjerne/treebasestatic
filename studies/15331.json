The volvocine green algae represent a model\nlineage to study this type of sex evolution and show two types of\ngametic unions: conjugation between isogametes outside the parental\ncolonies (external fertilization during isogamy) and fertilization\nbetween small motile gametes (sperm) and large gametes (eggs) inside the\nfemale colony (internal fertilization during anisogamy and oogamy).\nAlthough recent cultural studies on volvocine algae revealed\nmorphological diversity and molecular genetic data of sexual\nreproduction, an intermediate type of union between these two gametic\nunions has not been identified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colonial Volvocine Green Algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70381.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colonial Volvocine Green Algae cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70733.phy"}]}
