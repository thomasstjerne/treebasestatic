In this study, we sampled 61\nindividuals of 6 populations from Elgon, Aberdare, Kenya, Kilimanjaro\nand Bale. We sequenced 1 nuclear and 3 plastid fragments, and conducted\nphylogenetic analysis, divergence time estimation, principal coordinate\nanalysis and gene flow analyses to investigate the phylogeographic\nstructure of this species. The phylogenetic analysis and principal\ncoordinate analysis suggest that the species consists of two major\ngroups, one is the populations from Elgon, Aberdare and Bale, and one is\nthe populations from Kenya and Kilimanjaro. The results also support\nthat the character of multicellular hairs is mutable and therefore no\nchange of the taxonomic concept of this species is needed. Divergence\ntime estimation suggest that H. rueppellii has established in Kenya and\nAberdare one million years ago, however, low migration rate between the\ntwo mountains were suggested by gene flow analysis. In addition,\ndiversification of this species seems to be not affected by the East\nRift Valley. Different from previous phylogeographic studies, which show\nclose relationship between Aberdare and Kenya, this study indicates a\nbarrier for plant migration and gene flow between the two\nmountains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Haplocarpha rueppellii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80556.phy"}]}
