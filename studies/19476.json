This allowed testing of several\ninfrageneric groupings within the genus as well as morphological species\nconcepts. Molecular data from one nuclear and four plastid markers\nsupport the genus as a monophyletic group. However, the monophyly of the\ntwo largest subgenera, subgenus Riccia and subgenus Ricciella, are not\nsupported, with the latter being polyphyletic and well nested within\nsubgenus Riccia. Several currently accepted species such as Riccia\ninflexa and Riccia lamellosa were also found to be polyphyletic. A\nsecond tree reconstruction using only trnLÂ–F sequences allowed comparison\nto several taxa collected outside of Australia. This showed that some\nspecies have a truly cosmopolitan distribution, whereas others have\nnot.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Riccia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96890.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Riccia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96891.phy"}]}
