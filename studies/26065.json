These\nalgae sexually reproduce through the formation of zygospores from single\nclones (homothallic) and through the formation of zygospores between\ndifferent clones (heterothallic). The conjugating algae genus Spirogyra\nis generally found in freshwater environments, and its conjugation\nprocess has been well investigated. However, due to experimental\ndifficulties in inducing conjugation, heterothallism has not been\ndescribed in Spirogyra. Herein, we reported, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first discovery of heterothallic Spirogyra strains\nfollowing the induction of conjugation. The conjugation of the strains\nof Spirogyra fluviatilis required two clearly genetically differentiated\nstrains. Our mating experiments with these strains also demonstrated\nthat their sexuality was genetically determined and that the F1 strain\nfrom germinated zygospores conjugated with only one parental strain.\nMoreover, phylogenetic analyses showed that these heterothallic strains\nwere phylogenetically related to their homothallic relatives. In this\nstudy conducted on Spirogyra, the induction of conjugation in\nheterothallic strains facilitated our understanding of their\ndiversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S4b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirogyra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135017.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirogyra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135015.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4a","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirogyra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirogyra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135014.phy"}]}
