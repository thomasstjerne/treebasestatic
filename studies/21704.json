Thirty-four powdery mildew samples on 18 host species\nwere collected in 2014Â–2016 from this country and examined by\nmorphological and molecular methods. Consequently, 18 powdery mildew\ntaxa have been identified. The morphological characteristics of these\nspecies are described and illustrated. Erysiphe arcuata, E.\ncorylacearum, E. quercicola, E. syringae-japonicae, and E.\nviciae-unijugae are new powdery mildew species recorded from Azerbaijan.\nIn addition, Corylus avellana for E. corylacearum, Castanea sativa for\nE. quercicola, Carpinus orientalis for E. arcuata are new host species\nfor the mentioned fungi worldwide.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111745.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111746.phy"}]}
