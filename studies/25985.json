Retiboletus brevibasidiatus sp. nov. is described as\nnew to science whereas R. fuscus and R. nigrogriseus are reported for\nthe first time from Thailand. R. brevibasidiatus sp. nov. produces\nmedium-sized basidiomes, with dark blonde to clay pileus, densely\nreticulate stipe mostly on the upper part with pale yellow to chrome\nyellow basal mycelium. It is difficult to separate R. brevibasidiatus\nfrom other closely related species on the basis of macroscopic\ncharacters,. However, the new species can be distinguished by\nmicroscopic characters, mostly the shorter basidia. The macro- and\nmicro-morphology of the Retiboletus fuscus and R. nigrogriseus\ncollections from Thailand fit well with the previous descriptions of\nmaterials from China and Japan. Detailed descriptions, molecular\nphylogeny and illustrations are provided for each of the three species\nreported here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122694","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122694.phy"}]}
