L.\ncitriniporus is characterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate\nbasidiocarps with lemon yellow pore surface when fresh, become buff to\nclay pink when dry, distinct snow white and fimbriate sterile margin,\ntissue become pink in KOH, a monomitic hyphal system, generative hyphae\nthin- to distinctly thick-walled, usually encrusted with fine yellow\ncrystals, and oblong ellipsoid to subcylindrical basidiospores measuring\n(3.2)3.44.2(4.5) × (1.7)1.82.1(2.2) µm. The phylogenetic analysis based\non molecular data of ITS + nLSU rDNA sequences showed that the new\nspecies belonged to Luteoporia, formed a monophyletic lineage with a\nstrong support (100% BS, 100% BP, 1.00 BPP), and was closely related to\nL. albomarginata, and then grouped with Phlebia chrysocreas. Both\nmorphological and molecular characters confirmed the placement of the\nnew species in Luteoporia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Luteoporia citriniporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128376.phy"}]}
