Most species have large white or pale yellow petals with\nconspicuously fringed margins, the fringes sometimes several cm long.\nPollination is usually by hawkmoths. Previous molecular data for a small\nnumber of species suggested that a monophyletic Trichosanthes should\ninclude the Asian genera Gymnopetalum (four species, lacking long petal\nfringes) and Hodgsonia (two species with petals fringed). Here we test\nthese groupsÂ’ relationships using a sampling of 60% of their species and\n4759 nucleotides of nuclear and plastid DNA. To infer the time and\ndirection of the geographic expansion of the Trichosanthes clade we\nemploy molecular clock dating and statistical biogeographic\nreconstruction, and we also address the gain or loss of petal\nfringes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichosanthes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54993.phy"}]}
