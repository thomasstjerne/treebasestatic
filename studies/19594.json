High-throughput sequencing has improved the\ncapacity to generate data and yields more informative datasets. We\nsequenced and analysed the chloroplast genomes of 22 species of the\norder Nemaliales as a case study in the use of phylogenomics as an\napproach to achieve well-supported phylogenies of red algae. Results\nChloroplast genomes of the order Nemaliales are highly conserved,\ngene-dense and completely syntenic with very few cases of gene loss. Our\nML estimation based on 195 genes recovered a completely supported\nphylogeny, permitting re-classification of the order at various\ntaxonomic levels. Six families are recognised and the placement of\nseveral previously contradictory clades is resolved. Two new sub-orders\nare described, Galaxaurineae and Nemaliineae, based on the\nearly-branching nature and monophyly of the groups, and presence or\nabsence of a pericarp. Analyses of subsets of the data showed that\n>90% bootstrap support can be achieved with datasets as small as\n2,500 nt and that fast and medium evolving genes perform much better\nwhen it comes to resolving phylogenetic relationships. Conclusions In\nthis study we show that phylogenomics is an efficient and effective\napproach to investigate phylogenetic relationships. The six currently\ncircumscribed Nemaliales families are clustered into two evolutionary\nlineages with strong statistical support based on chloroplast\nphylogenomic analyses. The conserved nature of red algal chloroplast\ngenomes is a convenient and accessible source of data to resolve their\nancient relationships.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97380.phy"}]}
