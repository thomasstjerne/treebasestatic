However, taxonomy of Ganoderma species\nremains controversial, since it was initially classified on the basis of\nmorphological characteristics. Recently, Ganoderma sichuanense and\nGanoderma lingzhi was proposed as a reâ“proposed name for Ganoderma\nlucidum in China. Likewise, all strains of the Korean âG. lucidumâ were\nclustered into one group together with G. sichuanense and G. lingzhi\nfrom China, when a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken based on the ITS\nrRNA gene sequences of the Ganoderma species. However, Europe and North\nAmerican strains which are regarded as true G. lucidum were positioned\nin clearly different group. Based on these results, reâ“consideration of\nnaming Korean cultivated Yeongji âG. lucidumâ should be needed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma ITS NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91011.phy"}]}
