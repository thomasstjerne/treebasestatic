The\nbiogeographic history of the genus was tracked using ancestral area\nreconstructions and molecular dating. Three independent colonization\nlineages from the Eritreo-Arabian subregion of the Sudano-Zambesian\nRegion were revealed: one endemic clade comprising Aerva revoluta/A.\nmicrophylla and once within A. lanata and A. javanica. Our results\nprovide further support for the dominance of Eritreo-Arabian affinities\nin the flora of Socotra, in contrast to more rare affinities to\nMadagascar, the Mascarenes, southern Africa, and tropical Asia. Our data\npoint towards colonization via dispersal, rather than a vicariance\norigin of the island elements. The overall biogeographic patterns of\nAerva show only limited concordance with other taxonomic groups\ndistributed on Indian Ocean islands.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aerva","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4619.phy"}]}
