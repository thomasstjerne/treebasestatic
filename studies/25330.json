A total of 30 sequences were newly\nobtained from five isolates of S. difformis and S. resinae. Phylogenetic\nanalyses suggested that these two species are grouped with Trinosporium\nguianense and Xylona hevae (Xylonoaceae, Xylonales, Xylonomycetes), and\nshould be affiliated to Xylonomycetes. Based on morphological\nobservations, S. difformis and S. resinae can be distinguished at the\ngeneric level. Thus, Tromera is retained as the natural genus to\naccommodate T. resinae (= S. resinae). Xylonomycetes was morphologically\nre-circumscribed to comprise of four genera, Sarea, Trinosporium,\nTromera and Xylona, which are shared having endophytic or saprobic stage\non various plant in their lifecycle, ascostroma-type ascomata with\nparaphysoid and Lecanora-type bitunicate asci with thick-walled apex,\nand pycnidial asexual morphs in their morphology. Although\nSymbiotaphrinales is treated as member of Xylonomycetes in previous\nstudies, the order is characterized by having paraphyses with\nnon-thickened at apex and poorly differentiated bitunicate asci with\nthin-walled apex in sexual morph as a saprobe on higher plants, and\nyeast stage in asexual morph as a symbiont with the gut of arthropods,\nwhich are clearly different from those of other members in\nXylonomycetes. Thus, we treat Symbiotaphrinales as Pezizomycotina\nincertae sedis. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS sequence with\nenvironmental DNA (eDNA) were also conducted to clarify their habitats\nand the results implied their worldwide distributions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120937","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120937.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120938","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120938.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120930","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120930.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120933","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120933.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120934","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120934.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120935.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120932","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120932.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120931","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120931.phy"}]}
