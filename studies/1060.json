The species\nis characterized by biverticillate penicilli, slightly rough, subglobose\nto ovate conidia, brownish cleistothecia that become brown-gray with\nage, and ascospores with two equatorial flanges and slightly roughened\nvalves. All strains produced a large number of indole alkaloids and the\nuncharacterized metabolites emon-1088, HOLOX and isom1, while aflo, gx,\nRAIMO and STOT were produced by a majority of strains. Eupenicillium\ntropicum is morphologically most similar to E. shearii, but based on\nITS-LSU sequences, is most closely related to Penicillium citrinum, P.\nsartoryi and P. westlingii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupenicillium tropicum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5814.phy"}]}
