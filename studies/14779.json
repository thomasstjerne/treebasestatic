However, recent changes in taxonomy and identification of\nRhizopus of which heavily depend on molecular approach, produce\nsignificant problem for mycologists in many developing countries,\nincluding Indonesia. Until now, identification of Rhizopus in Indonesia\nmainly based on morphological and DNA finger printing approaches. In\nthis study, 30 strains of Rhizopus spp. isolated from tempeh from\ndifferent regions in Indonesia were analyzed using combination of\nmorphology, physiology, and molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results\nshowed that 29 strains belong to Rhizopus microsporus, and one strain\nbelongs to R. delemar. Many previous publications in Indonesia reported\nthat inoculum of tempeh was R. oligosporus, thus the current finding is\nimportant contribution in relation to validate the information regarding\nidentity of Rhizopus species used as inoculum of tempeh in\nIndonesia","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66935.phy"}]}
