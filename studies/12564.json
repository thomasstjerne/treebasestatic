So far, a phylogenetic analysis based on genomic\nsequences of four non-functional nuclear loci has been reported for 44\nnatural isolates of N. crassa. Three subgroups (clades) with a distinct\ngeographical distribution have been identified: clade A (Caribbean Basin\nand Ivory Coast), clade B (Europe, Ivory Coast and India), and clade C\n(India). Here, we report the results of a phylogenetic analysis of 16\nadditional isolates. Six of these were from the Caribbean Basin, eight\nfrom Europe and one from Pakistan and one from Thailand. The previously\ndescribed clades and their geographical distribution were generally\nconfirmed. All Caribbean isolates belonged to clade A and all European\nisolates belonged to clade B, with the exception of one isolate from\nItaly, which also belonged to clade A, suggesting a transport from the\nCaribbean Basin or the Ivory Coast to Europe. Interestingly, the\nisolates from Pakistan and Thailand were found in a separate group,\nbasal to all other clades. Their phylogenetic classification is not yet\nclear as they might belong to N. crassa but as well to N. perkinsii,\npotentially representing yet undescribed phylogenetic groups or species\nof Neurospora, or hybrids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora crassa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52215.phy"}]}
