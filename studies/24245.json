Twelve novel species are\ncharacterized based on combined sequence data analyses of internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), beta tubulin (β-tubulin) and translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (EF1α) coupled with morphological characters.\nThe taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of pestalotioid-fungi are\nreappraised with suggestions for future work.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Pseudopestalotiopsis_1 tre","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudopestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116876.phy"}]}
