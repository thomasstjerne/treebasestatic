Strains were examined by deep\nmulti-loci phylogenetic and morphological analyses. Maximum-likelihood\nand Bayesian phylogenies proved that Parathyridariella gen. nov. is a\ndistinct genus in the family Thyriadriaceae. Analyses based on five\ngenetic markers revealed seven new species: Neoroussoella lignicola sp.\nnov., Roussoella margidorensis sp. nov., R. mediterranea sp. nov., and\nR. padinae sp. nov. within the family Roussellaceae, and Parathyridaria\nflabelliae sp. nov., P. tyrrhenica sp. nov., and Parathyridariella\ndematiacea gen. nov. et sp. nov. within the family Thyridariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118962.phy"}]}
