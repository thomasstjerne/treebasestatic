In this\nstudy, we inferred interspecific relationships within the genus using\nnucleotide sequences of nuclear (nrDNA ITS and ETS) and chloroplast\n(matK, trnL-F, and psbA-trnH) markers. Pieris nana is sister to the\nclade comprising the rest species of Pieris, i.e., Pieris subg. Pieris.\nThe species of subg. Pieris diverge consecutively in the order of Pieris\ncubensis, P. swinhoei, P. floribunda, P. phillyreifolia, and P. formosa\nplus P. japonica. Neither section Phillyreoides nor section Pieris is\nmonophyletic, and P. phillyreifolia of NA is more closely related to EA\nspecies (P. formosa and P. japonica) than to the other NA species (P.\nfloribunda). Morphological characters (such as inflorescence position,\ntesta cell shape, and placenta attachment) used to define the sections\nare homoplasious, having evolved more than once in Pieris. Dispersal and\nvicariance analyses suggest that ancestral populations of Pieris were\nwidespread in EA+NA+WI, and two dispersal events may have occurred from\nthe New World to the Old World. Pieris cubensis may have originated as\nthe result of a dispersal event from NA+EA during the early\ndiversification of Pieris in the late Eocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pieris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5250.phy"}]}
