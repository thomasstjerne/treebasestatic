A highly virulent and clonal\nstrain of the parasite, first found in the UK, has become the\npredominant strain there and spread to continental Europe.\nDiscriminating this epidemic strain of T. gallinae from other strains\nnecessitated development of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST).\nDevelopment of the MLST was facilitated by the assembly and annotation\nof a 54.7 Mb draft genome of a cloned stabilate of the A1 European finch\nepidemic strain (isolated from Greenfinch, Carduelis chloris, XT-1081/07\nin 2007) containing 21,924 protein coding genes. This enabled\nconstruction of a robust 19 locus MLST based on existing typing loci for\nTrichomonas vaginalis and T. gallinae. Our MLST has the sensitivity to\ndiscriminate strains within existing genotypes confidently, and resolves\nthe American finch A1 genotype from the epidemic European finch A1\ngenotype. Interestingly, one isolate we obtained from a captive\nblack-naped fruit dove Ptilinopsus melanospilus, was not truly T.\n¬¬¬gallinae but a hybrid of T. gallinae with a distant trichomonad\nlineage. Phylogenetic analysis of the individual loci in this fruit dove\nprovides evidence of gene flow between distant trichomonad lineages at\ntwo of the 19 loci examined and may provide precedence for the emergence\nof other hybrid trichomonad genomes including T. vaginalis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
