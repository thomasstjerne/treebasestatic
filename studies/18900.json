The aim of this\nstudy was to characterize strains isolated from milk bread rolls by\nphenotypic and genotypic analyses. Using multilocus data from the\ninternal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA, partial translation\nelongation factor 1-α, actin and beta-tubulin gene sequences, three\nisolates were identified as a new species in the Cladoporium\nsphaerospermum species complex. This novel species, described here as\nCladosporium lebrasiae, is phylogenetically and morphologically distinct\nfrom other species in this complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94080.phy"}]}
