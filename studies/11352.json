The present study\nfocuses on a group of closely related strains of green algae and shows a\ncase of autapomorphic CBCs, which results in a conflict of the CBC\napproach with phylogenetic evidence obtained from the same data set. In\naddition, we evaluated another arbitrary species-delimitation criterion,\nthe barcoding gap, in the clade of interest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mrbayes consensus","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rbcL Bracteacoccus tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31451.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS2 tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31452.phy"}]}
