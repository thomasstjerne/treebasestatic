Truffles belonging to\nTuber (Pezizales, Ascomycota), ‘true truffles’, associate with diverse\nplant hosts, including economically important species such as pecan\n(Carya illinoinensis). Morphological and phylogenetic studies have\ndelimited several major lineages of Tuber, which include many cryptic\nand undescribed species. One of these, the Maculatum clade, is a\nspeciose group that is characterized by relatively small, light colored\nascomata that have alveolate-reticulate spores. Here we describe two new\nspecies within the Maculatum clade, Tuber brennemanii and Tuber\nfloridanum (previously identified as Tuber sp. 36 and Tuber sp. 47). We\ndelineate these two species by phylogenetic analyses of nuclear\nITS1-5.8SITS2 and partial 28S rDNA, and through morphological analysis.\nSystematic studies of ascomata and ECM fungal communities indicate that\nthese species are geographically widespread and are common ECM symbionts\nof pecans and other members of the Fagales, particularly in sites with\ndisturbed soils and nutrient enrichment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber brennemanii and Tuber floridanum ITS1-2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110776.phy"}]}
