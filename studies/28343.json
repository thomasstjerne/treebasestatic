(Symphyodontaceae) in East and\nSoutheast Asia. Japanese plants previously recognized as S. perrottetii\nare shown to include at least five different species: S. asper (Mitt.)\nA.Jaeger, S. copelandii Broth., S. gollanioides Nog., S.\nrecurvomarginatus (Dixon & Sakurai) H.Akiyama, comb. nov. and S.\nrheophilus H.Akiyama, sp. nov. In addition, previous Japanese record of\nS. echinatus (Mitt.) A.Jaeger is actually S. asper. Symphyodon\nlongispinosus H.Akiyama, sp. nov. from southwestern China is newly\ndescribed. Subsequently, S. perrottetii s. str. is excluded from China\nand Japan and has its revised distribution range from southwest India\n(type locality of S. perrottetii), Sri Lanka, central Thailand, and\nSingapore. Symphyodon merrillii Broth., once regarded as a synonym of S.\nperrottetii, is again recognized as a distinct species with its\ndistribution in Malesia and Indochina. Symphyodon ovalifolius H.Akiyama\n& M.Suleiman, sp. nov. is described and classified under the\nsubgenus Parasymphyodon H.Akiyama & M.Suleiman, subg. nov.\nRheoshevockia fontana Ignatov, W.Z.Ma & D.G.Long is again\ndemonstrated to have a unique systematic position sister to the genus\nSymphyodon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 7 from INCOMPLETE search (criterion: minimize Tree\nvalue using
