We have sampled the two\nforms sympatrically in Norway, and the shallow form on the Swedish west\ncoast. Phylogenetic and haplotype analyses based on the mitochondrial\ncytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the nuclear internal\ntranscribed spacer region (ITS1 5.8SrDNA ITS2) unequivocally indicate\nthat the deep and shallow form belong to two distinct species. We apply\nthe name N. foliosum to the shallow form, and N. crypticum, new species,\nto the deeper form. A lectotype is selected for N. foliosum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6643.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6043.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6642.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6677.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6008.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Notophyllum, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6226.phy"}]}
