Despite this fact the relationship between\nParmeliaceae and other groups in Lecanorales is still poorly known. The\naim of the present study is to contribute to finding the sister-group to\nParmeliaceae, as an aid for future studies on the phylogeny and\ncharacter evolution of the group. We do this by sampling all potential\nrelatives to the Parmeliaceae that we have identified, i.e.Â Gypsoplaca,\nJapewia, Mycoblastus, Protoparmelia, and Tephromela, a good\nrepresentation of the major groups within the Parmeliaceae s. lat., and\na good representation of other taxa in the core-Lecanorales. We use\nmolecular data from two genes, nuclear LSU and mitochondrial SSU rDNA,\nand a Bayesian analysis of the combined data. The results show that the\nclosest relatives to Parmeliaceae are the two genera Protoparmelia and\nGypsoplaca, which are crustose lichens. Parmeliaceae in our sense is a\nwell-supported group, including also the family segregates\nAlectoriaceae, Hypogymniaceae, Usneaceae, and Anziaceae. The results\nalso indicate that the family Mycoblastaceae is monophyletic only if\nTephromelataceae is included and that neither Calvitimela nor\nMycoblastus are monophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6413.phy"}]}
