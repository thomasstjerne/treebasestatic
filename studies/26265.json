The causal pathogens of blight-like symptoms\nthat occurred in Myanmar in 2019 were observed and identified. They were\nevaluated morphological characteristics and molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses based on the combined gene sequences of rDNA of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(gapdh), Alternaria major allergen (Alt a1), translation-elongation\nfactor 1 alpha (tef1) and RNA polymerase second largest subunit (rpb2)\nregions. According to the phylogeny, the two species clustered into\ndifferent sections. One of which was close to A. montanica in sect.\nPorri, while another was A. burnsii in sect. Alternaria.\nMorphologicially, the species in sect. Porri was as well distinct from\nA. montanica but also different its similar species of A. cepulicola in\nthe sporulation pattern and conidial size, considered as a new species\ndescribed herein as A. cepae. Another species was also identical to A.\nburnsii in the morphology. In addition, pathogenic assays revealed that\nthe two Alternaria species were the causal agents of leaf blight on\nonion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined gene datasets","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_123528.phy"}]}
