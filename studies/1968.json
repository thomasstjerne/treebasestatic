Sequences from12 isolates of F. poae, 10 isolates of F.\nsporotrichioides and12 isolates of F. langsetiae yielded 4, 5 and 5\ngenotypes respectively. In addition we included one isolate of F.\nkyushuense. The aligned sequences were subjected to neighbor-joining,\nmaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses. The results from the\ndifferent analyses were highly concordant due to a harmonic dataset. A\nlikelihood test on all the topologies revealed that none of them could\nbe rejected. All the analyses support the suggestion of F. langsethiae\nas a separate taxon in the Fusarium section Sporotrichiella. They also\nreveal that F. langsethiae is more related to F. sporotrichioides than\nto F. poae, and that F. kyushuense is more related to F. poae than to F.\nsporotrichioides although morphological characters could lead you to\nbelieve the opposite.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium, section Sporotrichiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4124.phy"}]}
