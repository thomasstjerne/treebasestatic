S. fragile is characterized by\nan annual growth habit, resupinate basidiocarps with salmon to peach\nfresh pores which becoming cinnamonÂ–buff to pinkish buff upon drying,\nmargin thin with distinct rhizomorphs, a monomitic hyphal system,\ngenerative hyphae thin- to distinctly thick-walled with simple septa,\nneither amyloid nor cyanophilous. The phylogenetic analysis based on ITS\n+ nLSU rDNA sequences shows that the new species belongs to\nSteccherinum, forming a monophyletic lineage with strong support (100%\nBS, 100% BP, 1.00 BPP). In addition, a new combination, S. subcollabens,\nis also proposed based on examination of its type material and\nphylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetically, Steccherinum fragile is closely\nrelated to S. amapaense and groups with S. subcollabens, S. formosanum\nand S. collabens. Both morphological and molecular characters confirm\nthe placement of the new species and combination in Steccherinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steccherinaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131233.phy"}]}
