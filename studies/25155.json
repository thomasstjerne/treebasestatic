However, few\ntaxonomic studies of these algae have been conducted in African ancient\nlakes. Here, we describe two species of colonial volvocine green algae\nin cultures originating from water samples from Lake Victoria, an\nancient lake in Africa. One was identified as an undescribed\nmorphological species of Eudorina; E. compacta sp. nov. This new species\ncan be distinguished from other Eudorina species by its compactly\narranged vegetative cells that form a hollow ellipsoidal colony. The\nother was identified as Colemanosphaera charkowiensis. The genus\nColemanosphaera is new to Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colonial Volvocine green algae RbcL 49OTUs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119803.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudorina ITS-ok","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119804.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colemanosphaera ITS-ok","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119805.phy"}]}
