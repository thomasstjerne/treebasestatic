Phylogenies based\non the four data sets were congruent and the combined analysis produced\na well-supported pattern of relationship among the species. The North\nAmerican species, Hamamelis virginiana, H. mexicana and H. vernalis,\nformed a robust clade with H. virginiana basal. This suggests that\nHamamelis vernalis and H. mexicana are not relicts, as previously\nsupposed. The Japanese species, Hamamelis japonica, is more closely\nrelated to the North American species than to the Chinese species, H.\nmollis, which is consistent with leaf morphological characters. This\nbiogeographic pattern is congruent with that seen in several other plant\ngroups and is consistent with a series of vicariance events possibly\ninvolving Beringian exchange between Asia and North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3651.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3652.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3653.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3654.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3655.phy"}]}
