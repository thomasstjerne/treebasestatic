The\nphylogenetic reconstruction presented here, based on a recent collection\nof the species, clearly places M. cineana in a clade comprised of Cuban\nspecies of the polyphyletic genera Tetrazygia s. l. and Pachyanthus s.\nl. Thus, M. cineana represents the sole Hispaniolan member of an\notherwise Cuban clade, and an uncommon biogeographical pattern in\nmelastomes. Miconia cineana, although described here from sterile\nspecimens, is easily distinguished from the other species of this clade\nusing vegetative morphology, as well as phylogenetic placement. This\nstudy highlights the utility of molecular data when coupled with\nmorphology, allowing the discovery of an unrecognized species in a\nregion of high diversity and endemism, i.e., the Massif de la\nHotte.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Miconia cineana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70275.phy"}]}
