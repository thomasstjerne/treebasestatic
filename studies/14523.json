Rehner & Humber, is identified as Cordyceps scarabaeicola Y.\nKobayasi based on the teleomorphic material of the B. sungii isolate\nused in the recent phylogenetic study. Cordyceps Fr. 1818 is an older\ngeneric name than Beauveria Vuill. 1912 in Cordyceps sensu stricto.\nHere, C. scarabaeicola is suggested to be adopted for B. sungii on the\npriority basis of both generic name and species epithet in compliance\nwith the recent revision of Article 59 of the Melbourne Code (recently\nchanged to the ‘International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and\nplant’ or ICN). The pros and cons of a unified nomenclature for\npleomorphic fungi are briefly discussed with reference to\nBeauveria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cordyceps scarabaeicola and Beauveria sungii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65495.phy"},{"tree_label":"RaxML","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cordyceps scarabaeicola and Beauveria sungii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65494.phy"}]}
