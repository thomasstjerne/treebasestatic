In this study, we revised a set of Penicillium\nisolates from various sources together with morphologically related\nmaterial obtained from acidic and saline soils in the Soos Nature\nReserve (Czech Republic). Two phylogenetic sister species of Penicillium\noxalicum are illustrated and described as Penicillium diatomitis sp.\nnov. CCF 3904T) and Penicillium soosanum sp. nov. (CCF 3778T). Both\nspecies can be distinguished from P. oxalicum based on molecular data,\nmorphological characters and extrolite pattern. Penicillium diatomitis\nmimics P. oxalicum by its macro- and micromorphology and the acid\nproduction on CREA is the recommended tool for their\ndifferentiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112080.phy"}]}
