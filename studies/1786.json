Isolates of a Rhexocercosporidium sp. were obtained from\nginseng (Panax quinquefolius) roots with symptoms of rusted root. These\nisolates were found to be genetically and morphologically distinct from\nthe only described species in this genus, R. carotae. Sequence data from\nthe ribosomal DNA region spanning the internal transcribed spacers 1 and\n2 and from a portion of the Ã¢-tubulin gene of the ginseng\nRhexocercosporidium were compared to those of R. carotae. Parsimony\nanalyses of sequence data showed that R. carotae and the ginseng\nisolates belonged to distinct clades. Conidia of a typical ginseng\nisolate were significantly shorter and possessed fewer septa than R.\ncarotae, but shared rhexolytic secession of conidia with R. carotae. The\nbinomial Rhexocercosporidium panacis is proposed to accommodate isolates\nof this genus that are associated with the rusted root disease.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4812.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Tub 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars F 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars F 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4814.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars F 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars Tub 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pars Tub 2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4809.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhexocercosporidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4810.phy"}]}
