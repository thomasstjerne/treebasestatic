Whereas this diverse group was once divided into 3\ngenera (Merriam 1895), a revision by Russell (1968) recognized only\nOrthogeomys, with MerriamÂ’s original genera relegated to subgeneric\nstatus as Heterogeomys, Macrogeomys, and Orthogeomys. Recent studies\nhave called into question the monophyly of Orthogeomys, as well as the\nvalidity of 4 currently recognized Orthogeomys species. In this\nanalysis, the first to include all 11 recognized species of the genus,\nwe examine 3 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear gene sequences and analyze\ncranial morphology to explore relationships within the genus. Our 4,352\nbase pairs of DNA sequence data support a taxonomic revision that\nretains the genus Orthogeomys (including only O. grandis) and combines\nthe subgenera Heterogeomys and Macrogeomys into the resurrected genus,\nHeterogeomys (7 species). In addition, 3 currently recognized species of\nOrthogeomys are synonymized as follows: O. cuniculus with O. grandis; H.\nthaeleri with H. dariensis; and H. matagalpae with H. cherriei. A\nsynonymy and key to the species of the genera Orthogeomys and\nHeterogeomys are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"mtDNA","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91502.phy"},{"tree_label":"nuclearDNA","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91503.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91504.phy"}]}
