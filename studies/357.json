These data (1) support the\nresurrection of Lipinia rouxi as a distinct species in congruence with\ndata from nontraditional morphological characters presented by Greer and\nMys, (2) show a large degree of genetic divergence between species while\ndata for traditional morphological characters show almost no\ndifferentiation, and (3) based on parsimony, support the phylogenetic\nhypothesis (((noctua, rouxi, pulchra) longiceps) leptosoma).
