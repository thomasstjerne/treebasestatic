To\nstabilize the nomenclature available, relevant types were examined.\nPhylogenetic relationships and species limits were investigated using\nrDNA ITS and nuclear RPB2 sequences and the results were compared with\nthe morphological data. We recognized seven species: C. bovinus\n(neotypified) and six species described as new C. anisochrous, C.\nbovinaster, C.bovinoideus, C. fuscobovinus, C. fuscobovinaster, and C.\noulankaÃ«nsis. Their taxonomy, ecology, distribution, and relationships\nare discussed, and a key to species is provided. A total of 122\nsequences were generated including 15 type sequences representing 6\nspecies previously not included in the public sequence data bases.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius section Bovini in northern Europe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55536.phy"}]}
