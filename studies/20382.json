It is\nmorphologically characterized by stromatic conidiomata, filiform\nparaphyses, and two types of conidia: type I: ellipsoid to ovoid,\nturning pale brown with a median distoseptum and longitudinal striations\nwhen mature; type II: cashew-shaped or irregular-shaped, with granular\ncontent, round at apex, becoming pigmented with 1Â–2-septate when aged,\nrarely form longitudinal striations. Its relationships with other\nspecies of Lasiodiplodia are discussed based on morphology and ITS,\ntef1-a, TUB and RPB2 rDNA sequences comparisons. Distoseptate conidia\nwere first reported in Lasiodiplodia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20376 49x532 RPB2 ML LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103015.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20376 49x532 RPB2 ML LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103016.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20376 49x532 RPB2 ML LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103014.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20378 73x1441 He","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103011.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20372 73x506 ML LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103018.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20378 73x1441 He","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103012.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107041.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107044.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20375 63x403 BT ML LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103017.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107040.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia cashewspora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103009.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia 20660 73x1781 Lasio CON","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103013.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107037.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107038.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107036.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia cashewspora ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103010.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107039.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107042","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107042.phy"},{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107043.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107045.phy"}]}
