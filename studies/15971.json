Here, we report a new species of seadragon from\nWestern Australia with substantial morphological and genetic differences\nto the only two other known species. We describe it as Phyllopteryx\ndewysea n. sp. Although the leafy seadragon (Phycodurus eques) and the\ncommon seadragon (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus) occur along Australia’s\nsouthern coast, generally among relatively shallow macroalgal reefs, the\nnew species was found more offshore in slightly deeper waters. The\nholotype was trawled east of the remote Recherche Archipelago in 51 m;\nadditional specimens extend the distribution west to Perth in 72 m.\nMolecular sequence data show clear divergence from the other seadragons\n(7.413.1% uncorrected divergence in mitochondrial DNA) and support a\nplacement as the sister-species to the common seadragon. Radiographs and\nmicro-computed tomography were used on the holotype of the new species\nand revealed unique features, in addition to its unusual red coloration.\nThe discovery provides a spectacular example of the surprises still\nhidden in our oceans, even in relatively shallow waters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP jack","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76600.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML best comb","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76627.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP jackknife comb","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76626.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipart Tmo","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76620","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76620.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76599.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipartitions","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76602","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76602.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML best","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76601.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP jack S7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76610","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76610.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2 S7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76609","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76609.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 S7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76608","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76608.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1 Aldo","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76613.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP jack Aldo","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76614","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76614.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP MP comb","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76625","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76625.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML best Aldo","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76615","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76615.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipart comb","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76628","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76628.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipart Aldo","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76616","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76616.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML best S7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76611","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76611.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipartitions S7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76612","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76612.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML best Tmo","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76619","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76619.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP jackknife Tmo","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76618","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76618.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP MP Tmo","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76617","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76617.phy"}]}
