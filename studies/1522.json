Phylogenetic trees generated using Neighbor\njoining, Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods showed that\nOtidea is a monophyletic group. Our morphological and molecular data\nindicate that Flavoscypha should be synonymized with Otidea and that\nOtideopsis is treated as a subgenus of Otidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Otidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2602.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Otidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2600.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Otidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2601.phy"}]}
