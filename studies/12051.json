This study offers an extended\nsampling of species from all known genera to clarify their phylogeny and\nto provide an estimate of the time of origin of extant holocephalan\ntaxa. Three mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b, 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA)\nwere sequenced and analysed using a variety of phylogenetic methods\n(Bayes, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum parsimitry). Callorhinchidae\ndiverged from Rhinochimaeridae and Chimaeridae about 192 Ma ago.\nChimaeridae and Rhinochimaeridae diverged from each other about 143 Ma\nago. Within Rhinochimaeridae, Neoharriotta is the sister genus to the\nclosely related Harriotta and Rhinochimaera. Eight species of the family\nChimaeridae, belonging to the genera Hydrolagus and Chimaera were\nexamined. They probably had a common ancestor about 97 Ma ago and appear\nparaphyletic. These results indicate that the traditional morphological\ngeneric definition of the families Rhinochimaera and Chimaera has to be\nreinvestigated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49252","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49252.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49253.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49255","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49255.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49254","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49254.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49246","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49246.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49247.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49248.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49249.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49250.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49245","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49245.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr49251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_49251.phy"}]}
