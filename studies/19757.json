Here, the complete plastome sequence of\nAlniphyllum eberhardtii Guillaumin is reported, representing the first\nplastome of the basal asterid family Styracaceae (Ericales). The\nplastome is 155,384 bp in length and contains 79 protein-coding genes,\n30 tRNA genes and 4 rRNA genes, totaling 113 unique genes with 19 genes\nin the Inverted Repeat region. Unusual features of the plastome include\nthe presence a large 20-kb inversion in the Large Single-Copy region,\nthe pseudogenization of the accD gene, and the loss of the second intron\nfrom clpP. The 20-kb inversion includes 14 genes and has not been\npreviously reported in other Ericales plastomes. Thirty-nine plastid\nsimple sequence repeats (SSRs) are characterized, which may provide\ngenetic resources for the conservation of this economically import\ntimber plant. Phylogenetic results inferred from ML and MP analyses of\n66 plastid genes and 26 taxa reveal that the Styracaceae is sister to a\nclade including Actinidiaceae and Ericaceae and suggest that complete\nplastomes are likely to be very helpful in resolving the basal\nrelationships among Ericales families, which have resisted resolution in\nsmaller phylogenetic data sets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Styracaceae complete plastome: 66 shared protein-coding\ngenes of 26 species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100260.phy"}]}
