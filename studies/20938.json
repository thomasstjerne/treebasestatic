In this study, we employed a\ncombined culture-independent (454- pyrosequencing) and culture-dependent\n(dilution-to-extinction) approach to investigate the mycobiota of indoor\ndust collected from 93 buildings in 12 countries worldwide. High and low\nwater activity (aw) media were used to capture mesophile and xerophile\nbiodiversity, resulting in the isolation of approximately 9 000 strains.\nAmong these, 340 strains representing seven putative species in\nAspergillus subgenus Polypaecilum were isolated, mostly from lowered aw\nmedia, and tentatively identified based on colony morphology and\ninternal transcribed spacer rDNA region (ITS) barcodes. Further\nmorphological study and phylogenetic analyses using sequences of ITS,\nÎ²-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin (CaM), RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit (RPB2), DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), and a pre-mRNA processing\nprotein homolog (TSR1) confirmed the isolation of seven species of\nsubgenus Polypaecilum, including five novel species: A. baarnensis, A.\nkeratitidis, A. kalimae sp. nov., A. noonimiae sp. nov., A.\nthailandensis sp. nov., A. waynelawii sp. nov., and A. whitfieldii sp.\nnov. Pyrosequencing detected six of the seven species isolated from\nhouse dust, as well as one additional species absent from the cultures\nisolated, and three clades representing potentially undescribed species.\nSpecies were typically found in house dust from subtropical and tropical\nclimates, often in close proximity to the ocean or sea. The presence of\nsubgenus Polypaecilum, a recently described clade of\nxerophilic/xerotolerant, halotolerant/halophilic, and potentially\nzoopathogenic species, within the built environment is noteworthy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112849","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112849.phy"},{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112845","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112845.phy"},{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112850","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112850.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule++","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112846","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112846.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112847","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112847.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112848","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112848.phy"},{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112851","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112851.phy"}]}
