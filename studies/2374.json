Species of Mycosphaerella are\ncommonly associated with leaves and twigs of eucalypts, leading to\ndefoliation, dieback, and even death of young plants. In the present\nstudy, numerous isolates of Mycosphaerella species were obtained from\nleaf litter, or living leaves exhibiting leaf spot symptoms, or the more\nsevere Mycosphaerella leaf blotch disease symptoms. Isolates were\ncompared based on DNA sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer\nregion (ITS1 & ITS2) and the 5.8S gene. Based on these data, as well\nas their cultural characteristics or on three different media,\nmorphology, anamorphs, and ascospore germination patterns, 21 new\nspecies are described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, HKY85 from ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_718.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, HKY85 from ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_717.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, HKY85 from ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_719.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerella, HKY85 from ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_720.phy"}]}
