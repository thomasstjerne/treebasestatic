Among them, Myxarium is the largest genus\ncontaining 21 accepted species of which nine are reintroduced below and\nfive are described as new. Protodontia is limited to three species only,\nP. subgelatinosa (generic type) and two newly described species from\nAfrica. Protoacia is a new monotypic genus for P. delicata, sp. nov.,\nwidely distributed on coniferous hosts in Eurasia. Myxariellum is\nerected for two new species with smooth hymenophore from northwestern\nNorth America while Gelacantha is introduced for G. pura, a new species\nwith hydnoid hymenophore from Caucasus. Our data do not confirm the\npresent synonymy of Sebacina sphaerospora with Tremella glaira, and\nthese species are placed in two separate genera  Hydrophana, gen. nov.,\nand Ofella, gen. nov., respectively.
