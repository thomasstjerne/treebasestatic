On the\nbasis of morphology, physiology and the nucleotide divergence in the\nD1/D2 domain of the 26S nuclear ribosomal RNA (nrRNA) gene, as well as\nthe internal transcribed spacers (ITS) domain of the nrRNA gene operon,\nthese strains were identified to represent three novel species in this\nteleomorphic genus. An additional isolate, that is publically available\nfrom the CBS yeast collection and isolated from Taiwan, were found to be\nsimilar to one of the novel species described from Thailand. Yeast\nspecies belonging to the Yamadazyma clade have previously been described\nas members of the C. membranifaciens clade. These species are widely\ndistributed and were isolated from diverse habitats, including water,\nplants, animals and guts of insects and termites. In the present study\nthe ITS region is shown to be a valuable region for species\nidentification within this clade and the novel species proposed are\nCandida vaughaniae sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8583T), Candida\nkhao-thaluensis sp. nov. (type strain CBS 8535T), and Candida tallmaniae\nsp. nov. (type strain CBS 8575T).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr27354","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_27354.phy"}]}
