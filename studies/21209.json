This species\nhas characters similar to other species of the genus Vaginatispora, but\ndiffers in ascospore dimensions. Phylogeny inferred from a combined LSU,\nSSU, ITS and TEF sequence dataset reveal a close association of the new\ntaxon to species of Vaginatispora, but as a distinct lineage. Hence, in\nthis paper, we introduce the new species with illustrations,\ndescriptions and comparison with related taxa. A synopsis of characters\nof all Vaginatispora species along with a dichotomous key are also\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vaginatispora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109585.phy"}]}
