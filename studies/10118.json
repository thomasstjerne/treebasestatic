Species assigned to\nDebaryomyces partitioned into three clades and species assigned to\nPichia were distributed among six clades. These well supported clades\nwere interpreted as genera, and from this analysis, the following new\ngenera are proposed: Babjeviella, Meyerozyma, Millerozyma, Priceomyces,\nand Scheffersomyces. The genus Schwanniomyces was reinstated and\nemended, and the genus Yamadazyma was phylogenetically defined. From\nthis study, 23 new combinations and 3 new ranks are proposed. The\npreceding genera are members of a single, large clade, and it is\nproposed to delineate this clade as the new family\nDebaryomycetaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Babjeviella, Meyerozyma, Millerozyma, Priceomyces and\nScheffersomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6616.phy"}]}
