The results of the\ncladistic analysis were compared to and combined with cpDNA restriction\nsite data from a previous study. All molecular data identified four\nmajor clades within Clerodendrum s.l. and showed the genus to be\npolyphyletic. Clerodendrum s.s., minus Konocalyx and Cyclonema, is\nmonophyletic and the genus should be restricted to this group. Cyclonema\nand Konocalyx form a clade distinct from Clerodendrum s.s. which has\nbeen recognized as Rotheca Raf. (Steane and Mabberley, 1998).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clerodendrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1437.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clerodendrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1438.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clerodendrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1439.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clerodendrum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1440.phy"}]}
