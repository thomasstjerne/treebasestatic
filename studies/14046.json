Intergeneric\nphylogenetic relationships remain unknown and have never been addressed\nusing molecular sequence data. We present a first plastid molecular\nphylogeny of the subtribe represented by three genera (Eremospatha,\nLaccosperma and Oncocalamus). Four chloroplastic intergenic spacers\n(psbA-trnH, psbZ-trnFM, atpI-atpH and rps3-rpl16) were sequenced for 80%\nof the species found in the subtribe. The data was analyzed using\nMaximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods.\nOur results show that the subtribe of Ancistrophyllinae is monophyletic\nas well as the three genera. However relationships between genera remain\nunresolved. Our analyses provided some details on relationships between\nspecies within Eremospatha and Laccosperma, but not in Oncocalamus. The\nspecies Eremospatha cabrae and Eremospatha dransfieldii were recovered\nwith strong support as sister and together formed a highly divergent\nclade sister to the rest of the genus. The four plastid markers used\nhere provide interesting levels of resolutions and should be considered\nin other species level analyses in palms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62287","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62287.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62285.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62286","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62290","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62290.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62288","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62288.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62289.phy"}]}
