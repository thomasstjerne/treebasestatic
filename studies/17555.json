Based on new and newly identified collections,\nphylogenetic analysis of nucleotide data, scanning electron microscopy\nand relaxed-clock divergence time estimation, we recognise O. glaciale\nand O. cavallii under the new genus Delongia, which is more closely\nrelated to Psilopilum, Atrichum and Steereobryon than to Oligotrichum.\nThe two species are mutually highly distinct in both morphological and\nmolecular characters, with D. glacialis occurring across the Himalaya\nfrom Pakistan to Yunnan and D. cavallii found in the East African Rift\nMountains and on the island of Réunion. Divergence time estimation\nsuggests that the lineages represented by the extant species diverged\nfrom each other around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary (~23 mya),\ncontemporaneous with the origins of the East African Rift system and\nongoing uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, while Delongia most\nlikely shares a common ancestor in the Eocene (56-34 mya) either with\nthe arcticsubarctic genus Psilopilum or with Atrichum and\nSteereobryon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polytrichaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87461.phy"}]}
