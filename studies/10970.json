In contrast, the\nannual species of this genus, which are often adapted to disturbed\nsites, are adichogamous selfers with low P/O ratios and wide\ndistributions. According to the present reconstruction of the evolution\nof Erodium, recurrent perennial to annual shifts occurred from a time\nearlier than the establishment of the Mediterranean climate during the\nPleistocene. The diversification of the terminal clades containing\nannuals and perennials is dated to 6.42 Mya, between the onset of the\nMessinian (Miocene) and the end of the Pliocene. By adapting to several\ntypes of breeding systems (mixed-mating and selfing), many species of\nErodium were able to meet the challenges of climatic deterioration and\nthe changes in pollinators that took place at the end of the Tertiary.\nHigh selfing and an annual lifespan seem to have evolved multiple times\ntogether, but reversions may also have occurred. Within-plant variation\nof herkogamy and dichogamy may represent adaptations to variation in the\npollinator community during dry or cold periods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erodium trnLF gaps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58225.phy"}]}
