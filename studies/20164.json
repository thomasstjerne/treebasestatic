MLST and phenotypic data\nstrongly supported its inclusion in the Fusarium solani species complex\n(FSSC). The new species produced a red pigment in the Sabouraud Dextrose\nAgar similar to other members of the complex. The macroconidia arising\nfrom sporodochia are falcate, robust stature, dorsiventral, 25-septated\n(mostly 5-septated), with blunt in apical cell and papilla in basal cell\nshape. The microconidia are ellipsoidal, 01-septated, produced from long\nmonophialides. Chlamydospores produced singly or in pairs. In vitro\nAmphotericin B (MIC 1 µg/ml) was the most active drug, followed by\nvoriconazole (MIC 8 µg/ml), which cured the infection. Our finding\nindicates yet another lineage within FSSC capable of invastive human\ninfection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"231","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101539.phy"}]}
