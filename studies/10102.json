Although the DNA sequence of the ITS region evolves rapidly, core\nfeatures of the RNA secondary structure of the ITS1 and ITS2 segments\nare conserved. The results demonstrate that structural conservation of\nGC-rich helical regions is facilitated primarily through compensatory\nbase changes (CBCs), hemi-CBCs, and compensating insertions/deletions\n(indels), although slippage of the RNA strand is potentially an\nadditional mechanism for maintaining basepairing interactions. The major\nconclusion of the structural analysis of both ITS segments is that two\nfactors appear to be involved in limiting the type of changes observed:\na high GC bias for both ITS1 and ITS2 and structural constraints at the\nRNA level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Suppl.
