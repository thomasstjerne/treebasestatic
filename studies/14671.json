It is now\nestablished that C. gloeosporioides sensu lato comprises 33 phylogenetic\nspecies and C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto is not a common pathogen of\ntropical fruits. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic\nrelationships of 85 Colletotrichum isolates associated with select\ntropical fruits and flowering plants from India. In the ApMat marker\nanalysis, the 85 isolates clustered with 7 known Colletotrichum species\n(C. aotearoa, C. dianesei, C. endomangiferae, C. musae, C. siamense, C.\ntheobromicola, Glomerella cingulata f. sp. camelliae) and six novel\nlineages. One of the novel lineages is described and illustrated in this\npaper as Colletotrichum communis sp. nov., while new-host pathogen\nassociations for C. aotearoa, C. endomangiferae, C. dianesei and C.\ntheobromicola are reported from India. Out of the 85 isolates analysed\nin this paper, 73 isolates clustered within the C. siamense species\ncomplex, indicating that C. siamense species complex, not C.\ngloeosporioides sensu stricto, is common on tropical fruits. In\ncomparison with act, cal, gapdh, ITS and tub2 gene markers, we recommend\nthe use of the ApMat marker for accurate identification of cryptic\nspecies within the C. siamense species complex. We believe that the\nApMat marker, in combination with one or two similar ‘phylogenetically\nsuperior’ gene markers, is a better candidate for species-level\nclassification of fungi that were traditionally identified as\n‘Colletotrichum gloeosporioides’.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule Consensus of 1204 MPTs","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum 5 genes Con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86527.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense bs-con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86529.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86530.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Apmat bs-con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86528.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86531.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86532.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86533.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum ApMat-Siamense mp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86534.phy"}]}
