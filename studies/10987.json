Three bacterial\nstrains were isolated from the entomopathogenic nematodes of the white\ngrubs, Polyphylla olivieri in Iran. This study was focused on the\ncharacterization of the bacterial strains. By using phonetic characters\nand 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence. This polyphasic approached led to\nidentifying all strains as Xenorhabdus spp., separated as X. nematophila\nand X. poinarii. The phylogenetic position of those symbionts analysed.\nCharacterization of symbiotic bacteria associated with the\nentomopathogenic nematodes is a main step to study of different aspects\nof this complex. These results provide new insights into biodiversity of\nbacto-helminthic complex in Iran.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xenorhabdus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25571.phy"}]}
