Morphological and osteological characters were investigated to\ndetermine which would usefully contribute to construction of a phylogeny\nfor the family: 57 characters were selected and 35 rejected. Reasons for\nacceptance or rejection, and selection of outgroup, are provided. The\ncladograms resulting from phylogenetic analyses, and the distribution of\ncharacter states within the family revealed the significant influence of\nhomoplasy: acceptance of such is a necessary step however, to arriving\nat a reasonable phylogeny for this apparently straightforward yet\nincredibly diverse catfish family. Monophyly of the family was confirmed\nchiefly on the basis of thirteen characters. Twenty-three genera are\nrecognised, including three new genera, Amissidens, Cryptarius and\nPlicofollis. The genera are diagnosed, their relationships discussed,\nand their species composition and geographical distribution are stated.\nThe difficulty of assigning some taxa is revealed by placing them as\nincertae sedae; and the lack of access to some material is acknowledged\nas a hindrance to completion of a global revision.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 15A-B Combined+","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ariidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53853.phy"}]}
