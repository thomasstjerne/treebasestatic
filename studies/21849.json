This is the first report of a Fissuroma species from the Hedychium\n(Zingiberaceae) host collected from Taiwan. Morphological examination\nreveals species to be remarkably different from extant species in having\nbroad cylindric-clavate asci with long, club-shaped apical and basal\nappendages with spread distinct thick mucilaginous sheath around the\nascospores. DNA sequence data analyses based on the LSU, SSU and tef1-Î±\ngene regions depict a close relationship to F. maculans, the type\nspecies, but isolates of the new taxon are phylogenetically distinct.\nThe new species is compared with other Fissuroma species and a\ncomprehensive description and micrographs are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108070.phy"}]}
