Morphologically, it is\ncharacterized by yellowish lamellae, relatively small, ovoid to\nsubamygdaliform-ellipsoid, dextrinoid spores with distinct germ pores,\nnarrowly clavate, clavate to subfusiform cheilocystidia, and a pileus\ncovering made up of a trichoderm of subcylindrical hyphae. Sequences\nfrom the internal transcribed spacer region show that M. subcitrophylla\nis distinct from all other tested Macrolepiota species, and suggests it\nis the sister taxon to Macrolepiota clelandii, a species originally\ndescribed from Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47411.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47412","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47412.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47410","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47410.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47413","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47413.phy"}]}
