The disease has led to significant losses of\nPinus radiata production in New Zealand but the disease appears less\nserious in Australia. Two cultural morphotypes of C. minus have been\ndiscriminated in New Zealand and isolates from Australia also correspond\nto these two morphotypes. In order to examine if the two morphotypes of\nCyclaneusma are different species, phylogenetic analysis using sequences\nfrom five gene regions (rDNA ITS, mt-LSU, n-LSU, tef-1 and BetaT-1) was\nconducted. This study revealed that C. minus consists of two distinct\nclades which correspond to the two morphotypes. One morphotype (verum)\nwas more closely related to C. niveum than to the other morphotype\n(simile). A morphological description is required to formalise the new\nspecies represented by the simile clade; an investigation of the\nindividual pathogenic behaviours of both morphotypes is also\nrequired.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma all gene Consensus tree of 4501 trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69414.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Cyclaneusma all genes DNAML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69413.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma mtLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69416.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma ITS DNAml","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69417.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma ntLSU DNAml","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69415.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma Elongation Factor 181213","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69419.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclaneusma Beta Tubulin 181213","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69418.phy"}]}
