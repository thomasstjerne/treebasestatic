The species was\nretrieved nested within the Hymenochaete s. str. clade; therefore\nHydnochaete is regarded as a synonym of Hymenochaete and the new\ncombination Hymenochaete peroxydata is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synonymy of Hydnochaete with Hymenochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64888.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synonymy of Hydnochaete with Hymenochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synonymy of Hydnochaete with Hymenochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64892.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synonymy of Hydnochaete with Hymenochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64891.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synonymy of Hydnochaete with Hymenochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64890.phy"}]}
