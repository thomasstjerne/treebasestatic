It\nproduces slimy masses of phialoconidia which are hyaline, cylindrical\nand aseptate, from discrete conidiogenous cells arising from superficial\nhyphal network associated with the swollen base of dark, erect, stiff,\nunbranched subulate setae. The new genus is compared with similar\nhyphomycete genera having setae or setiform conidiophores with phialidic\nconidiogenous cells, such as Avesicladiella, Circinotrichum,\nCylindrotrichum, Gyrothrix and Kylindria. Phylogenetic relationship of\nWenhsuisporus was sought by comparing the sequences of its ITS, LSU and\nRPB2 gene segments with those from representative taxa in the\nAustraliascaceae, Chaetosphaeriaceae, Glomerellaceae, Reticulascaceae,\nPlectosphaerellaceae and Xylariaceae. Phylogenetic trees inferred from\nconcatenated sequences of these multilocus gene segments revealed the\nplacement of this new genus within the Sordariomycetes, closely related\nto the Reticulascaceae of the Glomerellales. Since there is no other\nknown lineage with similar morphology or DNA sequences, the new genus\nand species Wenhsuisporus taiwanensis is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Wenhsuisporus","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131555.phy"}]}
