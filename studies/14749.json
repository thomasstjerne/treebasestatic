S. A. (M. odorata), although four species have been\ndescribed. This study reevaluates these proposed taxa using a\ncomprehensive approach to species delimitation analyzing variation in\nmorphology, phenology, geography, nuclear DNA, and chloroplast DNA.\nPrincipal components analysis of morphometric data reveals two clusters\nthat are geographically distinct. These groups also correspond to clades\nresolved with nuclear (ITS/26S and Xdh) and plastid (rpl32Â–trnL) DNA that\nare furthermore distinct phenologically. These data support recognition\nof M. reynoldsiae, a Florida endemic and recognition of M. odorata, an\nAppalachian endemic. Furthermore, Monotropsis lehmaniae, proposed based\non an autumn flowering period and floral differences, is shown to\ncomprise individuals that are not yet in anthesis and should not be\nrecognized. Cryptophila pudica, named based on its disjunct geographical\ndistribution and floral differences, is also shown to be indistinct. A\ntaxonomic revision of the genus is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66796.phy"}]}
