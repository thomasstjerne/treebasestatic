Proceraea albocephala, new species\nis morphologically separated from similar species by a prostomial white\nspot, and E. oligochaeta, new genus, new species is unique in having\nonly a few (12) simple unidentate chaetae in all chaetigers, and a\ntrepan with a single large and 2528 smaller teeth. We assess the\nphylogenetic positions of the four species using nuclear 18SrDNA,\ntogether with mitochondrial COI and 16SrDNA. Our molecular data show\nthat among the sequenced autolytines 1) P. albocephala, new species is\nmost closely related to P. nigropunctata Nygren & Gidholm, 2001, P.\nokadai (Imajima, 1966), and P. cornuta (Agassiz, 1862), 2) E.\noligochaeta, new genus, new species belongs within a clade together with\nProcerastea nematodes Langerhans, 1884, Virchowia clavata Langerhans,\n1879, and Imajimaea draculai (San Martín & López, 2002), 3) M.\nlongoprimicirrata is sister species to M. pentadentata (Imajima, 1966),\nand 4) P. madeirensis has a basal position within Procerini. The\nmolecular data suggests that Proceraea Ehlers, 1864 as currently\ndelineated is paraphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
