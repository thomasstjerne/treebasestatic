Based on multiple phenotypic characters and\nmultilocus phylogenetic analyses, ten species were distinguished, three\nof which are described as new species: T. austroindianum, T. hortense,\nand T. syagri. Among the remaining seven identified species, the\nfollowing five can be added to the Argentine mycobiota: T. afarasin, T.\nafroharzianum, T. endophyticum, T. guizhouense, and T. neotropicale.\nTrichoderma afroharzianum and T. endophyticum were the most frequent\nspecies found in the samples. In addition, a collection of isolates\npreviously identified as T. harzianum with antagonistic abilities were\nre-identified as T. afroharzianum, thus, highlighting the importance of\ncorrect identification of biocontrol species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132798.phy"}]}
