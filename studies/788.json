The higher-level\nclassification of this ecologically important group has been unsettled\nfor over one hundred years. The goals of the present study were to\nevaluate a recent phylogenetic classification by Hibbett and Thorn that\ndivided the homobasidiomycetes into eight major unranked clades, and to\ninfer the higher-order relationships among these clades. A dataset of 93\nspecies that represent all eight previously recognized clades was\nassembled, with 3800 bp of sequence data from nuclear and mitochondrial\nlarge and small subunit rDNAs for each taxon. Parsimony and maximum\nlikelihood analyses support the monophyly of the eight major clades\nrecognized by Hibbett and Thorn. Most groups are strongly supported in\nbootstrapped parsimony analyses, but the polyporoid clade remains weakly\nsupported. For the first time, the sister-group relationship of the\neuagarics clade and bolete clade is strongly supported, and the\nHygrophoraceae is strongly supported as the sister group of the rest of\nthe euagarics clade. Nevertheless, the backbone of the homobasidiomycete\nphylogeny, and the internal structure of several clades, remain poorly\nresolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes coreMPtree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3897.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes coreMLtree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3898.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes completeMPtree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3899.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homobasidiomycetes completeMLtree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3900.phy"}]}
