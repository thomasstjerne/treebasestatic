Preliminary\nmorphological, molecular, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that three\nof these fungi are new species, one of the genus Claroideoglomus , and\ntwo of Diversispora . Subsequent, extended phylogenetic analyses of\nalignments containing sequences of the nuc rDNA small subunit (18S),\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS), and large subunit\n(28S) region (= 18S-ITS-28S) alone and in concatenation with sequences\nof the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II ( RPB1 ) were conducted. The\nanalyses involved the putative new Claroideoglomus sp., other species of\nClaroideoglomus and Albahypha , both sensu Oehl et al., including A.\ndrummondii and A. walkeri , previously classified in Claroideoglomus\nsensu C. Walker & A. Schüßler , as well as Entrophospora infrequens\n, the two potentially new Diversispora species and other sequenced\nspecies of Diversispora . The results demonstrated that ( i ) the\nentrophosporoid spore-producing E. infrequens nested between species of\nClaroideoglomus forming glomoid-like spores, ( ii ) A. drummondii and A.\nwalkeri either clustered basally in a sister clade to a weakly or\nunsupported clade with the other Claroideoglomus spp. and E. infrequens\nor the two Albahypha spp. separated from each other, and ( iii ) the two\ndiversisporoid AMF are new species. Consequently, we synonymized\nClaroideoglomus with Entrophospora , giving priority to Entrophospora ,\nand erected eight new combinations in the Entrophosporaceae. Detailed\nmorphological studies confirmed the indications of the phylogenetic\nanalyses and, therefore, the new species, originally treated by us as\nClaroideoglomus sp., coming from Argentina, was described as E.\nargentinensis , and the two new species of Diversispora , both found in\nPoland, were given the names D. mareae and D. densissima . Finally, we\noutlined the hypothetical evolution of E. infrequens .","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124650.phy"}]}
