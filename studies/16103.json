While\nit is often assumed that clade diversity increases unbounded through\ntime, it has also been suggested that standing diversity is subject to\necologically determined limits. Here, we generate a new time-calibrated\nphylogeny of seed plant families, using Bayesian methods and 29 fossil\ncalibrations, to investigate patterns of diversification in plants. We\ncalculated net diversification rate for each clade in the phylogeny and\nassessed the relationship between clade age and species richness. We\nthen fit models of speciation and extinction to individual branches in\nthe tree to identify major shifts in rates. Overall, our data suggests\nthat the majority of lineages are diversifying very slowly, while a few\nlineages, distributed throughout the tree, are diversifying rapidly.\nDiversification is unrelated to clade age, no matter the age range of\nthe clades being examined, contrary to both the assumption of an\nunbounded lineage increase through time, and the paradigm of fixed\necological limits. These findings are consistent with the idea that\necology plays a role in diversification, but rather than imposing a\nfixed limit, it has variable effects on per lineage diversification\nrates through time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"425","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76393.phy"}]}
