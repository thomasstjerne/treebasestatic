In plants, these incongruences are\nmost often seen between data derived from the nuclear vs. the cp genomes\nand the nuclear markers used for comparison usually have been from the\nnuclear ribosomal (nr) internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). The\namount of genomic material shared between introgressing species can be\nhighly variable. In some of these cases, other nuclear genomic regions\nhave moved between species without leaving a signature on the nrITS. An\nexample of well-supported phylogenetic incongruence is the placement of\nDubautia scabra (DC.) D. D. Keck in the Hawai\u001aian silversword alliance\n(HSA); evolutionary hypotheses for D. scabra based on molecular as\nopposed to cytogenetic data are strongly discordant. In this paper, we\ntest these two conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses regarding the\nevolutionary relationships of Dubautia scabra using evidence from six\nlow-copy nuclear genes, as well as multiple chloroplast noncoding\nregions and nrITS. The nrITS region is also examined for the presence of\nmultiple copy types. Incongruence between inferred relationships based\non nuclear chromosomal arrangements and molecular phylogenetic data from\nchloroplast DNA and nrITS is resolved in favor of a hypothesis of\nancient hybridization rather than cytogenetic homoplasy. Most\nsingle-copy nuclear genes track histories of D. scabra compatible with\ncytogenetic data whereas chloroplast and nrITS data track a common,\ndifferent history that appears to reflect hybridization with a\nchromosomally distinct lineage that also occurs on Maui Nui and Hawai\u001ai\n(the Big Island).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5053.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2F","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5054.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5050.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5051.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5052.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5055.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2E","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5056.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid Origin and Genomic Mosaicism of Dubautia\nscabra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5057.phy"}]}
