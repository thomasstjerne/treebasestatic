Based on morphology and DNA sequence data of histone H3\n(his3), three species of Dactylonectria were identified including\nDactylonectria torresensis (40 isolates), D. macrodidyma (24 isolates)\nand D. novozelandica (14 isolates). In addition, one isolate belonging\nto the genus Pleiocarpon was found and it is described here as a new\nspecies, Pleiocarpon algeriense, based on morphological features and DNA\nsequence data of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS),\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), Î²-tubulin (tub2), and\nlarge subunit nrDNA (LSU). This is the first time that these species are\nreported in Algeria. Pathogenicity tests, were conducted with\nrepresentative isolates from each species. All of them were able to\ninduce typical necrosis symptoms on grapevine cuttings. By comparing the\nlesion length, Dactylonectria species were more aggressive than P.\nalgeriense.. These results emphasize the growing threat of black foot\npathogens, on most grapevine production areas in Algeria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"concatenated","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113197","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113197.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113196","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113196.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113200","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113200.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113202","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113202.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113201","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113201.phy"}]}
