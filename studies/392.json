These were\nexcluded from the sub-family because they possessed a median tegular\napophysis on the male palp, a feature which Wanless believed to be\nsynapomorphy of the group, and one which separated the group from\nmembers of the Spartaeinae. Our phylogenetic analysis of the extant\nmembers of the Spartaeinae, and the Cocalodes-group indicate that the\nlatter are monophyletic with other genera of the sub-family. An amended\ndefinition of the sub-family is provided.
