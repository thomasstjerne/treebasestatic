Still, prodution\nlosses can be associated with the anthracnose disease, caused by the\ngenus Colletotrichum. The present study had the objective to investigate\nwhich Colletotricum species are responsible for anthracnose disease in\npomegranate in the northeastern Brazilian region, by using multilocus\nphylogeny approach and morpho-cultural characteristics. Ten pathogenic\nstrains were obtained from symptomatic pomegranate fruits from the\nstates of Alagoas, Pernambuco and Bahia. The total DNA extracted was\namplified with GAPDH, Î²-TUB, CAL, ACT genes and the ITS-rDNA region. The\nsequences obtained were used to construct Bayesian inference\nphylogenetic trees. Mycelial growth rate, size and form of conidia and\nappressories were evaluated for morpho-cultural characterization, in two\nstrains from each species identified by the molecular analyses. In the\npresent study four species from the complex Colletotrichum\ngloeosporioides were identified: Colletotrichum tropicale, C. siamense,\nC. fructicola and C. theobromicola. This is the first report for all\nfour species on pomegranate fruits in the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102898","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102898.phy"}]}
