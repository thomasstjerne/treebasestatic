This study\ndescribes the heteroecious lifecycle of a rust fungus on Digitaria\neriantha (finger grass) and the Solanum species S. lichtensteinii (large\nyellow bitter apple), S. campylacanthum (bitter apple) and S. melongena\n(eggplant) in South Africa. Following field observations,\ncross-inoculation studies involving uredinial and telial isolates\ncollected from Digitaria plants, as well as aeciospores from the\ndifferent Solanum species, were completed. Pennisetum glaucum (pearl\nmillet varieties Milkstar and Okashana, as well as 12 lines) and S.\nelaeagnifolium (silverleaf nightshade or bitter apple) were resistant to\nthe rust isolates. Morphological descriptions and molecular phylogeny\ndata confirmed the identity of the rust fungus as P. penicillariae,\nherein reinstated as a full species. The macrocyclic, heteroecious\nlifecycle of P. penicillariae, described for the first time in South\nAfrica, allows for overwintering of teliospores on dormant D. eriantha\nplants. Aecial sporulation on Solanum species during spring and early\nsummer provides inoculum from which sprouting Digitaria plants can be\ninfected to initiate sporothallus infection cycles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133462","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133462.phy"}]}
