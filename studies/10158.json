We show that Rungwecebus from a second\nregion of Tanzania has a distinct mitochondrial haplotype that is basal\nto a clade containing all Papio species and the original Rungwecebus\nvoucher, supporting the placement of Rungwecebus as the sister taxon of\nPapio and its status as a separate genus. We suggest that the\nRungwecebus population in the Southern Highlands has experienced\ngeographically localized mitochondrial DNA introgression from Papio,\nwhile the Ndundulu population retains the true Rungwecebus mitochondrial\ngenome.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S4","ntax":"241","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeography of Rungwecebus kipunji","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeography of Rungwecebus kipunji","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeography of Rungwecebus kipunji","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6501.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeography of Rungwecebus kipunji","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6206.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2, S5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biogeography of Rungwecebus kipunji","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6273.phy"}]}
