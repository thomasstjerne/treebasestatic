P. lutzii occurs in the\ncentral and northern regions of Brazil. Conidia of P. lutzii are\nelongate differing from those of P. brasiliensis. Studies between P.\nbrasiliensis and P. lutzii may have significant clinical consequences of\nthe diagnosis and therapeutics of paracoccidioidomycosis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58652.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58653.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58654","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58654.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58655.phy"}]}
