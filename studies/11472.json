Maximum\nparsimony (PAUP) maximum likelihood (RaxML) and Bayesian inference\n(MrBayes) optimality criteria were used for phylogenetic analyses.\nResults confirm the placement of Hypopachus and Gastrophryne as sister\ntaxa, but the latter genus was strongly supported as paraphyletic, and\nas a result, we erect a new genus for the taxon G. usta. The African\nphrynomerine genus Phrynomantis was recovered as the sister taxon to a\nmonophyletic Chiasmocleis, which rendered our well-supported clade of\ngastrophrynines paraphyletic. Hypopachus barberi was supported as a\ndisjunctly distributed highland species, and we recovered a basal split\nin lowland populations of Hypopachus variolosus from the Pacific versant\nof Mexico and elsewhere in the Mesoamerican lowlands. Previous studies\ndid not find bioacoustic or morphological differences among these\nlowland clades, and our conclusions support the continued recognition of\ntwo species in the genus Hypopachus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypopachus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46289.phy"}]}
