In a recent survey of this family in Iran\ntwo fungi with diplodia-like anamorphs were isolated from various tree\nhosts. These two fungi were fully characterised in terms of morphology\nof the anamorphs in culture, and sequences of the ITS1/ITS2 regions of\nthe ribosomal DNA operon. Phylogenetic analyses placed them within a\nclade consisting of Barriopsis and Phaeobotryon, but they were clearly\ndistinct from known species in these genera. Therefore they are\ndescribed here as two new species, namely Barriopsis iranianum on\nCitrus, Mangifera and Olea and Phaeobotryon cupressi on Cupressus\nsempervirens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6102.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6025.phy"}]}
