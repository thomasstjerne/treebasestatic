Haskins, McGuin.\n& C.S. Berry has been isolated repeatedly from dried infructescences\nof Lythrum salicaria collected from Seattle and Kirkland, Washington.\nDetailed developmental, morphological and ultrastructural studies\nsuggested that it represents a taxon within Mycetozoa, closely allied\nwith Myxogastria (Myxomycetes), but with unique characteristics.\nPhylogeny based on two genes places it with confidence into the family\nEchinosteliidae. This species differs from a typical Echinostelium in\nthe way spores germinate and in the lack of a stalked sporophore, the\nlatter being a secondary loss. Semimorula liquescens may therefore be a\nuseful “negative” model to search for genes inducing stalk formation\nduring sporulation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Semimorula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6262.phy"}]}
