The new species is florally similar to G. thysanochilum but\ndiffers from it in the linear-oblanceolate leaves subtended by\nimbricating, dark brown cataphylls, presence of a papillose thickening\nnear the base of the labellum, proportionately shorter, obtrapezoid\ncolumn with lateral laminar wings and complete fusion of the filament,\nand prominent apicule of the rostellum remnant. A cladistic parsimony\nanalysis of DNA sequences of nuclear ITS region and plastid matK-trnK\nregion showed that the three currently recognized species of\nGaleoglossum form a monophyletic group, which is sister to Prescottia.\nGaleoglossum cactorum is known from a single locality in an unusual\nhabitat for orchids, i.e.Â xerophilous scrub dominated by columnar cacti\nof the genus Neobuxbaumia, whereas both G. thysanochilum and G.\ntubulosum dwell in oak and pine-oak forest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A new species of Galeoglossum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47728.phy"}]}
