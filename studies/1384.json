Although the\ndisease is well distributed throughout olive growing regions of the\nworld, its epidemiology and population structure remains unknown. The\naim of this study was thus to establish the genetic variability of\nSpanish isolates of P. cladosporioides using DNA sequence data from the\nITS region, as well as two protein-coding genes, actin and calmodulin.\nPhylogenetic data obtained here support P. cladosporioides to be closely\nrelated to other species of Pseudocercospora that reside in\nMycosphaerella. Spanish isolates clustered in two clades, indicating\nthat isolates from Catalonia were somewhat different from those\ncollected in Andalucia. However, isolates appeared to be genetically\nrelatively uniform, suggesting that chemical control of this disease via\na managed spraying programme may prove a viable option for controlling\nthe disease in Spain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora cladosporioides, 1 of 102 MP trees -\nITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2174.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora cladosporioides, 1 of 2 MP trees -\nITS, actin, calmodulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2175.phy"}]}
