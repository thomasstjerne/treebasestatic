Acanthocephalans\n(thorny-headed worms) are larger endoparasitic animals that use\nvertebrates and arthropods to complete their life cycle. The taxa\nAcantho-cephala and Rotifera are considered separate phyla, often within\nthe taxon Aschelminthes. We have reexamined the relationship between\nRotifera and Acanthocephala using 18S rRNA gene sequences. Our results\nconclusively show that Acanthocephala is the sister group of the rotifer\nclass Bdelloidea. Rotifera was nonmonophy-letic in all molecular\nanalyses, which supports the hypothesis that the Acanthocephala\nrepresent a taxon within the phylum Rotifera and not a separate phylum.\nThese results agree with a previous cladistic study of morphological\ncharacters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3425.phy"}]}
