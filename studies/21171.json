Hawksw.)\nD. Hawksw. & Spooner has been re-examined, re-described and compared\nwith new isolate of Antarctic bryophilous ascomycete. Since the\ncondition of type material was not sufficient for molecular studies, the\nnew isolate from similar area was used to designate an epitype with\nherbarium material. Phylogenetic analysis of this epitype material\nrevealed its closest relationship with Tilachlidiaceae family. However,\nit is forming separate lineage within this group. Therefore, a monotypic\ngenus Psychronectria is newly proposed to accommodate the new\ncombination P. hyperantarctica. The characters that distinguish\nPsychronectria from other morphologically and phylogenetically related\ngenera are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psychronectria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107722.phy"}]}
