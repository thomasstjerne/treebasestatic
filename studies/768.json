This has\nresulted in some confusion in the taxonomy and our understanding of the\npathology of these species because these anamorphs are very similar\nmorphologically and the characters used for differentiation can be\ninfluenced by the substrate. We have examined 89 isolates identified by\nthe collectors as B. dothidea (F. aesculi), B. ribis (Fusicoccum sp.),\nB. parva (F. parvum) or F. luteum. Cluster analysis of random amplified\npolymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker data identified three distinct groups,\nwhich we have designated Bd (probable B. dothidea), Br (probable B.\nribis, but including isolates of B. parva), and Fl (probable F. luteum).\nAnalysis of DNA sequence of the nuclear rDNA ITS region from a subset of\nisolates from each group supports these relationships. Measurement of\nconidia from a subset of isolates revealed statistically significant\ndifferences in shape that can be used to differentiate between conidia\nof the Bd group isolates and those of the other groups. Conidia of the\nBr and Fl group isolates, however, were similar. We conclude that B.\ndothidea can be differentiated from these other fungi with Fusicoccum\nanamorphs by all three techniques.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3846.phy"}]}
