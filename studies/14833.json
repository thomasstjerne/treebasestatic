The new\norder Stereopsidales and the new family Stereopsidaceae are described\nincorporating Stereopsis radicans and Stereopsis globosum, formerly\nClavulicium globosum. We show that not only do these species represent\nan old overlooked lineage, but both species harbour cryptic diversity.\nIn addition, a third species, Clavulicium macounii, appears as a\nplausible sister to the new lineage, but there is conflict in the data.\nAll specimens of Stereopsis radicans and Stereopsis globosum analysed\nhere are from the South and Central Americas, several records of\nStereopsis radicans have been made also from tropical Asia. We expect\nthe true diversity in this group to be a lot higher than presented in\nthis paper. Stereopsis radicans was formerly included in Polyporales,\nbut a placement within that order is rejected by our data through SH\ntests. The dataset consisted of four nuclear markers: rpb2, tef1, LSU\nand SSU, each of which was analysed separately using maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian analysis. Recombination detection tests indicate no\nplausible recombinations. The potential of Stereopsis radicans,\nStereopsis globosum and Clavulicium macounii being amphitallic is\nbriefly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Rpb2 Bayesian con 50 majrule","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77732.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rpb2 Max Lihelihood tree","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tef Max Likelihod tree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Stereopsidales SSU raxml","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77737.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77738.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU Bayesian con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77739.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77740.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tef MrBayes con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stereopsidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77736.phy"}]}
