Recent phylogenetic and morphological\ninvestigations have promoted major departures from established taxonomy.\nAs such, additional insights into evolutionary relationships of\nophiuroids are valuable. We analyzed ribosomal sequence data from a\nmitochondrial gene (16S rRNA) and a nuclear gene (18S rRNA) from 39\nophiuroids representing 14 of the 18 currently accepted families. Main\nfindings from our study include support for a polyphyletic Ophiomyxidae,\nparaphyletic Amphiuridae, monophyletic Euryalida, a sister relationship\nbetween the Ophiactidae and Ophiotrichidae, and a clade comprised of the\nAmphiuridae and Amphilepididae. Relationships within the families\nGorgonocephalidae, Ophiuridae, Ophiodermatidae and Ophiomyxidae are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93755","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93755.phy"}]}
