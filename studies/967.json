Despite a number of\nrecent molecular studies and a rich fossil record of sponges and\ncnidarians, the evolutionary relationships of the early branching\nmetazoan groups to each other and to a putative outgroup, the\nchoanoflagellates, remain uncertain. This situation may be the result of\nthe limited amount of phylogenetic information found in single genes and\nthe small number of relevant taxa surveyed. To alleviate the effect of\nthese analytical factors in the phylogenetic reconstruction of\nearly-branching metazoan lineages, we have cloned multiple\nprotein-coding genes from two choanoflagellates and diverse sponges,\ncnidarians, and a ctenophore. Comparisons of sequences for a-tubulin,\nb-tubulin, Elongation Factor 2, HSP90, and HSP70 robustly support the\nhypothesis that choanoflagellates are closely affiliated with animals.\nHowever, analyses of single and concatenated amino acid sequences fail\nto resolve the relationships either between early branching metazoan\ngroups or between Metazoa and choanoflagellates. We demonstrate that\nvariable rates of evolution among lineages, sensitivity of the analyses\nto taxon selection and conflicts in the phylogenetic signal contained in\ndifferent amino acid sequences obscure the phylogenetic associations\namong the early branching Metazoa. These factors raise concerns about\nthe ability to resolve the phylogenetic history of animals with\nmolecular sequences. A consensus view of animal evolution may require\ninvestigations of genome-scale characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4d
