A total of 30 species,\nrepresenting most of the major currently recognized squamate clades, was\nincluded in the analysis. As in previous morphological studies,\nAnelytropsis was strongly supported in Bayesian (mixture and\nunpartitioned models) and maximum-likelihood analyses as the sister\ntaxon of Dibamus. Thus, a monophyletic Dibamidae composed of these two\ngenera is supported by molecular data for the first time. Furthermore,\nseveral relationships in the inferred tree, although weakly supported,\nwere congruent with those found in previous molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses. Among these, Gekkota and the Dibamidae were recovered as\nrelatively basal groups within Squamata. A non-monophyletic Scleroglossa\nand Lacertiformes (=Amphisbaenia + Lacertidae + Teiidae +\nGymnophthalmidae) also were recovered. Although only weakly supported, a\nmajor difference from other recent molecular studies is the basal\nposition of Serpentes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anelytropsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5870.phy"}]}
