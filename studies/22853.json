Dacrymycetous fruiting bodies\nwere collected from dead branches of broad-leaved trees in Japan and\nidentified as D. pezizoides based on morphological characteristics such\nas turbinate or discoid basidiocarps, hyphae without clamp connections,\nthick-walled marginal hyphae, and 3-septate basidiospores. Molecular\nphylogenetic analysis based on LSU rDNA and ITS regions showed that D.\npezizoides made a monophyletic group with Dacrymyces spp. such as D.\nstillatus and D. chrysospermus, and Guepiniopsis buccina. Dacrymyces\npezizoides is considered to form their basidiocarps in Autumn on dead\nwood of broad-leaved trees in warm-temperate areas of Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymyces pezizoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114154.phy"}]}
