Fungi that contain the\nenzymes cyanase and carbonic anhydrase show a limited capacity to\ndetoxify cyanate. Here, we identify a novel putative cyanate resistance\ngene cluster (CR cluster) comprised of duplicated cyanase and carbonic\nanhydrase copies, trace its evolution across Ascomycetes, and examine\nthe evolutionary dynamics of its spread across populations of a\ncosmopolitan plant pathogen. Phylogenetic analysis of the two clustered\ngenes reveals that the CR cluster arose independently in Cochliobolus\nlunatus, Oidiodendron maius, and Fusarium oxysporum. In F. oxysporum,\ngenome-wide examination indicates that the CR cluster varies in copy\nnumber across isolates. Interestingly, CR cluster copies are always\nfound on F. oxysporum accessory chromosomes, which are enriched in\npathogenicity genes and transfer between asexual isolates. Examination\nof the phylogeny and distribution of the CR cluster in 163 F. oxysporum\nisolates from a wide variety of hosts suggests a recent history of\nrampant transfers between isolates. The independent evolution of the CR\ngene cluster in three fungal species and its spread across F. oxysporum\nboth suggest that this cluster evolved in response to a selection\npressure that is likely global (i.e., a pressure that affects multiple\nspecies and continents) and recent. We hypothesize that this selection\npressure is the recent introduction of cyanate fungicides in global\nagricultural practice.","trees":[{"tree_label":"best tree","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CR cluster gene tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75425.phy"},{"tree_label":"majority rules consensus","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carbonic Anhydrase ORF gene tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75432.phy"},{"tree_label":"majority rules consensus","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CR cluster gene tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75426.phy"},{"tree_label":"best tree","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carbonic Anhydrase ORF gene tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75430.phy"},{"tree_label":"majority rules consensus","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"EF1-alpha tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75428.phy"},{"tree_label":"majority rules consensus","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyanase ORF","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75433.phy"},{"tree_label":"best tree","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyanase ORF","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75431.phy"}]}
