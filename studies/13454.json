The\nisolates were grouped based on morphology and ERIC-PCR fingerprinting\npatterns and representatives of each group were identified by sequencing\nof the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Nine species from four\ndifferent genera in Botryosphaeriaceae were identified within the\nisolates. Many new fungus-host associations were established and several\nspecies of Botryosphaeriaceae are reported from conifers for the first\ntime. Most of these species also represent new reports from Portugal.\nThe genus Neofusicoccum that was thought to be mainly restricted to\nangiosperms was the most frequent within the collection of isolates,\nfollowed by Diplodia. Dothiorella and Botryosphaeria represented a minor\nfraction of the isolates. Interestingly, the most common species was N.\nluteum, which had never been reported from coniferous hosts. Our results\nindicate that Neofusicoccum species may be more important as pathogens\nof conifers than it was previously recognised.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57800.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57801.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57802.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57798.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57799.phy"}]}
