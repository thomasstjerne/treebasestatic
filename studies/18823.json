(Basidiomycota, Agaricales)\ncollected in the urea treated soil of broadleaf mixed forest from\nVietnam is described as a new ammonia fungus. In morphology, this\nspecies are similar to Coprinopsis cinerea a common species but differs\nin spore shapes. Phylogenetic analysis with the nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) data also support this new taxon. This\nis the first report of ammonia fungus saprophytic in Vietnam.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Phylogenetic tree for Coprinopsis neocinerea drawn by\nthe neighbor-joining analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93596.phy"}]}
