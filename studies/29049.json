Distoseptispora\nyunjushanensis is characterized by macronematous, mononematous, septate,\nunbranched conidiophores with monoblastic, integrated, determinate,\nterminal conidiogenous cells that produce acrogenous, solitary,\nobclavate, distoseptate conidia. Distoseptispora yongxiuensis is\ncharacterized by macronematous, mononematous, septate, unbranched\nconidiophores with monoblastic, integrated, determinate, terminal\nconidiogenous cells that produce acrogenous, solitary, obclavate,\ndistoseptate conidia. Distoseptispora meilingensis is characterized by\nmacronematous, mononematous, septate, unbranched conidiophores with\nmonoblastic, integrated, determinate, terminal conidiogenous cells that\nproduce acrogenous, solitary, obclavate, distoseptate conidia.\nITS-LSU-SSU-tef1 sequence analyses were used to infer the phylogenetic\nrelationship between D. yunjushanensis, D. yongxiuensis, D.meilingensis\nand related species. Both molecular analyses and morphological data well\nsupport D. yunjushanensis, D. yongxiuensis and D. meilingensis as three\nindependent taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135752","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135752.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135753.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135754","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135754.phy"}]}
