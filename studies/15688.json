It is similar in size and overall floral morphology to\nMalaxis cipoensis, a species endemic to upland rocky fields on the\nEspinhaço range in southeastern Brazil, which is its closest relative\naccording to a cladistics analysis of nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK)\nDNA sequences conducted here. However, M. irmae is distinguished from M.\ncipoensis by inhabiting lowland marshy grasslands, possessing 3−5\nlong-petiolate leaves per shoot (vs. 2 shortly petiolate leaves),\ncylindrical raceme (vs. corymbose), pale green flowers (vs. green-orange\nflowers) and less prominent basal labellum lobules. Malaxis irmae is\nmorphologically also similar to the Brazilian M. warmingii, which\ndiffers in its much larger plants and prominent basal labellum\nlobes","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malaxis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74430.phy"}]}
