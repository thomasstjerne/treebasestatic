These and other isolates of FOL were\ncharacterized for pathogenicity, race and vegetative compatibility group\n(VCG). Of the 39 California isolates, 22 were in VCG 0030, 11 in VCG\n0031 and six in a newly described VCG 0035. Among isolates of VCG 0030,\n13 were race 3 and nine were race 2. Of the isolates in VCG 0031 seven\nwere race 2, one was race 1, and three were non-pathogenic to tomato.\nAll six members of VCG 0035 were race 2. Restriction fragment length\npolymorphisms (RFLPs) and sequencing of the intergenic spacer (IGS)\nregion of rDNA identified five IGS/RFLP haplotypes among 60 isolates of\nF. oxysporum from tomato that coincided with VCGs. Based on RFLP\nhaplotypes of genomic DNA, five race 3 isolates from California shared\nthe same haplotype with a race 2 isolate from the same location, and all\n13 race 3 isolates clustered together into a subgroup in the neighbor\njoining tree. Collective evidence suggests that race 3 in California\noriginated from the local race 2 population.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4093.phy"}]}
