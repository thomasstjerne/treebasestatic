Based on\nvegetative cell and papilla shape, eyespot form and position, and the\nultrastructure of the eyespot and pyrenoid, the nine strains were\nclassified into four species: C. reticulata; C. rosae (H. & O. Ettl)\nH. Ettl; C. chlorococcoides (H. Ettl & K. Schwarz) Matsuzaki, Y.\nHara & Nozaki comb. nov.; and C. typhlos (Gerloff) Matsuzaki, Y.\nHara & Nozaki comb. nov. The taxonomic revision was supported by the\nrobust monophyly of the species resolved in phylogenetic analyses using\na combined dataset that included 18S ribosomal (r) RNA, ATP synthase\nÎ²-subunit, P700 chlorophyll a-apoprotein A1 and A2 genes, and nuclear\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences. The phylogenetic\nanalyses demonstrated that the pyrenoid-lacking species C. reticulata\nand the pyrenoid-containing species C. chlorococcoides, which has a\ndense pyrenoid matrix associated with starch grains, formed a robust\nmonophyletic group that the pyrenoid-lacking species C. rosae and the\npyrenoid-containing species C. typhlos were basal to. Comparison of the\nC. reticulata and C. chlorococcoides nuclear rDNA ITS2 secondary\nstructures revealed two compensatory base changes in the conserved helix\nIII region, suggesting a separation between these sister species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 34","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulata 18S/atpB/psaA/psaB/ITS2 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46921.phy"}]}
