The Gulf of Mexico has also been invaded by several\nmarine animal species, such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). To\ndate, no invasive marine macroalga has been reported in the Mobile Bay\narea. However, recent collections of an unusual species of Grateloupia\n(Halymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) in Alabama indicate that an introduction has\nbeen made. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis of the large subunit of\nribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) marker, the\nspecies has been identified as Grateloupia taiwanensis S.M. Lin &\nH.Y. Liang. This is the first report of G. taiwanensis outside its\nnative range.","trees":[{"tree_label":"garli mlt","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Grateloupia MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85435.phy"},{"tree_label":"garli mlboot","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Grateloupia MLBoot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85436.phy"}]}
