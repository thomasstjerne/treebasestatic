T. solaris-liber sp. nov. distinct morphology has\nbeen corroborated by its unique ITS-rDNA sequence. Macro and micro\nmorphologic descriptions and phylogenetic analyses of ITS data for this\nspecies, are provided and discussed in relation to similar spiny-spored\nspecies in this genus and its putative host plant Tuberaria guttata. T.\nsolaris-liber sp. nov. differs from other spiny-spored Terfezia species\nby its poorly delimited and thicker peridium and distinct spore\nornamentation, and from all Terfezia spp. in its ITS nrDNA sequence. In\ncomparison, T. fanfani usually reach large ascocarp dimensions, often\nwith prismatic peridium cells, with olive green tinges in mature gleba\nand a different spore ornamentation. T. lusitanica has a lighter\nyellowish and thinner peridium and a blackish gleba upon maturity, T.\nextremadurensis has a thinner well delimited peridium and Tuber-like\ngleba and T. cistophila has a spermatic odour and is exclusively\nassociated with Cistus spp..","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119413","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119413.phy"}]}
