These three new species are most\nsimilar to P. coriaceifolius, differing by their texture, size, and\nshape of leaves, inflorescence, corolla size and pubescence, anther\nshape, and pistil length. Additionally, Primulina guangxiensis was shown\nto be allied with Petrocodon in our ongoing phylogenetic analyses,\nprompting us to make the new combination P. guangxiensis. These four\nspecies of Petrocodon are all only known from a single or a few\nlocalities of limestone karst in Guangxi and are either endangered (EN)\nor critically endangered (CR) based on IUCN criteria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximum likelihood tree of Petrocodon and\nPrimulina","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62234","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62234.phy"}]}
