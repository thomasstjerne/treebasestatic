Eleven new extant species are described in\nfour newly recognized species groups of the single genus Syringogaster\nto give a total of 20 extant species (S. brachypecta, S. apiculata and\nS. tenuipes in the rufa-group; S. atricalyx, S. figurata, and S.\nplesioterga in the figurata-group; S. dactylopleura in the\ndactylopleura-group, and S. nigrithorax, S. brunneina, S. sharkeyi and\nS. palenque in the brunnea-group; Marshall & Buck are the authors of\nall extant new species). Two new fossil species, Syringogaster\nmiocenecus Grimaldi and S. craigi Grimaldi are described, each based on\na unique Miocene (ca. 17 myo) amber specimen from the Dominican\nRepublic. Morphological and molecular characters are used to estimate\nphylogenetic relationships among species of Syringogastridae, and\nbetween Syringogastridae and related diopsids. The fossil species appear\nto form the sister group to the Central and South American S. figurata\ngroup, and reveal Antillean extinction of the family from earlier in the\nTertiary.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diopsoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5875.phy"}]}
