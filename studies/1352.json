The morphology of the\nnew species, H. macrostroma, was compared to that of other species with\nlarge stromata, i.e. H. africana, H. gaertneriana, and H. schizostachyi.\nIn addition, phylogenetic analyses of partial sequences from three\ngenes, large subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA, translation elongation\nfactor 1-á, and RNA polymerase II subunit 1, were conducted to determine\nthe relationships of the new species to other species of\nHypocrella/Aschersonia. Phylogenetic analyses show that H. macrostroma\nbelongs to a strongly supported clade that includes H. africana, H.\nschizostachyi, and Aschersonia insperata, whereas other Hypocrella\nspecies belong to two sister clades. Hypocrella macrostroma is described\nand illustrated, and a lectotype is designated for H. gaertneriana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrella/Aschersonia species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4479.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrella/Aschersonia species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4480.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrella/Aschersonia species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4481.phy"}]}
