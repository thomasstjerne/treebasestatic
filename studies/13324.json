Published\nmultilocus molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that this pathogen\nrepresented a genealogically exclusive, phylogenetically distinct\nspecies representing one of the earliest divergences within the\nGibberella clade of Fusarium (Smith et al. 2011). Furthermore,\ncompletion of Kochs postulates established that this novel species was\nthe causal agent of Florida torreya canker disease. Here, we formally\ndescribe this pathogen as a new species, Fusarium torreyae. Pure\ncultures of this species produced long and slender multiseptate\nsporodochial conidia that showed morphological convergence with two\ndistantly related fusaria, reflecting the homoplasious nature of\nFusarium conidial morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium torreyae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56534.phy"}]}
