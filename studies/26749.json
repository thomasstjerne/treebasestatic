Molecular analyses indicated\nthat this species forms a clade separated from E. actinidiae var.\nactinidiae. Epitype was proposed for E. actinidiae var. actinidiae with\nex-epitype sequences. Based on the DNA sequence differences in the 28S\nrDNA and ITS region as well as the morphological differences in the\nlength of conidiophores, the fungus on L. tetragonum was described as a\nnew species, E. limonicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe actinidicola 28S rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134739.phy"},{"tree_label":"Erysiphe limonicola","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe limonicola ITS 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134738.phy"}]}
