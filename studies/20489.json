A phylogenetic analysis based on 18S nuclear ribosomal DNA and\nfour plastid markers (atpB, matK, rbcL and trnL-F) strongly supports the\nposition of the new genus in the tribe Epiprineae in subfamily\nAcalyphoideae. The phylogenetic position of the new taxon is also\nsupported by morphological and palynological evidence. Tsaiodendron is a\ndistinct lineage sister to Cladogynos in the tribe Epiprineae, and is\neasily distinguished from related members of the tribe by the sexual\nsystem, inflorescence arrangement and present disk glands in pistillate\nflower. Molecular divergence dating analysis based on matK, rbcL and\ntrnL-F sequences suggests that Tsaiodendron originated in the late\nMiocene at 10.42 mya (95% HPD: 5.23-18.88 mya). The origin of\nTsaiodendron may be correlated with the Red River incision from\nsouthwest China. The tribe Epiprineae is a monophyletic group,\nphylogenetic relationships and evolutionary trends of sexual system\nwithin the tribe are also discussed based on our phylogenetic\nresults.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101851","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101851.phy"}]}
