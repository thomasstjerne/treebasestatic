The disease is characterised by black necrotic spots that\ninitially appear on young leaves and petioles, which then become\nscab-like as the lesions age. Infected trees respond to infection by\nproducing shoots with small leaves that commonly appear feathered.\nFruiting structures typical of most foliar pathogens are not seen, but\nfungal spores are evident associated with the scab-like structures using\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Using culture-dependent methods,\ncultures resembling a species of Elsinöe were isolated from the lesions.\nDNA sequence comparisons for four gene regions, as well as morphological\nobservations showed that the fungus is an undescribed species in\nElsinoe, for which the name Elsinoe necatrix sp. nov. is provided.\nPathogenicity trials on a Eucalyptus clone with the Elsinöe species\nresulted in scab-like structures similar to those observed under field\nconditions and the fungus was easily re-isolated from the resulting\nlesions. This study includes a description of the pathogen and\ncharacterization of the disease for which the name Eucalyptus scab and\nshoot malformation is suggested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsinoe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131686.phy"}]}
