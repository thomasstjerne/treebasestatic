DNA barcoding is well established in\nanimals, but there is not yet any universally accepted barcode for\nplants. Here, we undertook intensive field collections in two\nbiodiversity hotspots (Mesoamerica and southern Africa). Using >1,600\nsamples, we compared eight potential barcodes. Going beyond previous\nplant studies, we assessed to which extent a \u001a\u001aDNA barcoding gap\u001a\u001a is\npresent between intra- and interspecific variations, using multiple\naccessions per species. Given its adequate rate of variation, easy\namplification and alignment, we identified a portion of the plastid matK\ngene as a universal DNA barcode for flowering plants. Critically, we\nfurther demonstrate the applicability of DNA barcoding for biodiversity\ninventories. In addition, analyzing >1,000 species of Mesoamerican\norchids, DNA barcoding with matK alone reveals cryptic species and\nproves useful in identifying species listed in Convention on\nInternational Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendixes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UPGMA all loci","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5091.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 377","ntax":"377","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK Mesoamerican Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 463","ntax":"463","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK Mesoamerican Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Base Clade","ntax":"275","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK Mesoamerican Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5869.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 454","ntax":"454","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK Mesoamerican Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5867.phy"}]}
