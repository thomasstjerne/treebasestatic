The molecular data indicate that the major\nlife history transition from ectoparasitism to endoparasitism has\noccurred independently several times within the family while the\nmorphological data indicate a single origin. Similar incongruent\ntopologies are obtained if the morphological data are partitioned by\neither of two methods: distinguishing (1) characters of the larval stage\nand female reproductive system, or (2) characters selected individually\nby the authors prior to the analysis as likely to be mechanistically\nassociated with endo/ectoparasitism. This result is supported by\nsignificant differences in tests of incongruence, and we propose that it\nis caused by convergence among morphological characters resulting from a\nshared life history strategy.
