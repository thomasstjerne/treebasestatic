Hoffm was evaluated by applying both morphological and\nphylogenetic approaches. A multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of 72\ngreen-algal Lobaria specimens collected between 2016 and 2019 was\nperformed using a three-locus and time-calibrated species-tree approach.\nThe analyses demonstrate that pairs of sexually and vegetatively\nreproducing lineages split into highly supported monophyletic clades.\nTaxonomically, 11 green-algal Lobaria species were identified as new to\nscience, while 9 were previously described species and one remains to be\ndetermined. The species differentiated during the Pliocene and\nPleistocene. The coincidence of paleoclimatic events with estimated\ndates of divergence supports a bioclimatic hypothesis for species\nevolution in the green-algal Lobaria. Molecular phylogenies, a summary\nof diversity, detailed new species descriptions and geographical\nanalyses are provided. A special recognition of species with a long\nevolutionary history, which merit high conservation priority, will be\nespecially critical for preserving geographically restricted endemics in\nthe Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains, where habitat loss is driving\nrapid declines.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132069.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 loci_combined_BI tree","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3 loci_combined_BI tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_132067.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132068.phy"}]}
