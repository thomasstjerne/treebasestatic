Phylogenetic analyses\nof the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA\ngenes (rDNA) region, partial β-tubulin, and elongation factor-1α gene\nrevealed that O. gracile was clearly separated from other species of the\nO. piceae complex. The sexual morph of O. gracile morphologically\nresembled O. breviusculum, but was clearly distinguishable based on\nmorphological characteristics of the synnema, such as the color and\nshape of the stipe. Mating compatibility tests indicated that there is\nsome degree of reproductive isolation between O. gracile and O. piceae,\nO. breviusculum, and O. subalpinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree based on beta-tubulin sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree based on ITS rRNA sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93117.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree based on multi-gene regions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree based on EF1alpha sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93116.phy"}]}
