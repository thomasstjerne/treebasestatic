We investigate the role played by\nthe cushion life form in the evolution of climatic niches in the plant\ngenus Androsace s.l., which spreads across the mountain ranges of the\nNorthern Hemisphere. Using robust methods that account for phylogenetic\nuncertainty, intraspecific variability of climatic requirements and\ndifferent scenarios of life history evolution, we show that climatic\nniches of Androsace exhibit low phylogenetic signal and that they rather\nevolved recently and punctually. Models of habitat selection fitted onto\nphylogenies show that cushions provided the opportunity to occupy cold\nenvironments, thus contributing to rapid climatic niche diversification.\nOur results indicate that climatic niches can be extremely labile, and\nthat considering the evolution of biological traits can reveal important\ninsights into the drivers of climatic niche evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primulaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58431.phy"}]}
