The genus Daucus comprises mostly herbs\n(therophytes, hemicryptophytes) with few rosette treelets (chamaephytes)\nendemic to various Macaronesian archipelagos, suggesting their\nindependent evolution. To elucidate the evolutionary pathways to derived\nwoodiness, we examined phylogenetic relationships and the habit and\nsecondary xylem evolution in Daucus and related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daucus Dated Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119314.phy"}]}
