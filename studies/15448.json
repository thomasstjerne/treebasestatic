However, previously published data on the\ntransition between these two growth forms in vitro were mostly obtained\nfrom a single strain. We examined the effect of six factors on\nyeast-mycelium dimorphism in vitro in 10 strains of Ophiostoma ulmi, O.\nnovo-ulmi and O. himal-ulmi. Nitrogen sources, calcium, and yeast\nextract, altogether with inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (caffeine) and\ndioxygenases (propyl gallate and salicylic acid) were tested in defined\nculture media. Morphological response to manipulation of several of\nthese factors varied according to the strain of Ophiostoma being\nanalysed. Responses ranged from no statistical differences in\nmorphological transitions to stimulation or reversion of yeast-mycelium\ndimorphism with the treatments that were tested. These results suggest\nthat different mechanisms and pathways operate in the control of the\nyeast-mycelium transition in Dutch elm disease pathogens. Oxylipins\ncould be involved in the yeast-to-mycelium transition, since the\naddition of a dioxygenase inhibitor, salicylic acid, reduced mycelium\nproduction in all strains that were tested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FIG1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML consensus tree of ITS CU and COl1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_70848.phy"}]}
