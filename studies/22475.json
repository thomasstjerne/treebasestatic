Here, we constructed a mitochondrial (mt) genome\ndata set, which included four newly sequenced mt genomes, 25 publicly\navailable mt genomes and 24 data sets with all mt protein‐coding and\nrRNA genes assembled from venom gland transcriptomes. In total, we\nanalysed 42 different species representing 27 genera of cone snails,\nthat is, about one third of the generic diversity of the group. In\naddition, we used the RNA‐Seq reads to assemble 21 nuclear genes, which\nwere concatenated in a nuclear data set. Finally, a combined data set\nincluding mt and nuclear genes was also constructed. The three data\nmatrices were analysed with probabilistic methods, site‐homogeneous and\nsite‐heterogeneous models, and with protein‐coding genes both at the\namino acid and nucleotide levels. Diet specialization, radular\nmorphology and the type of protoconch (paucispiral or multispiral\nindicating lecithotrophic or planktonic larvae, respectively) as well as\nconotoxin diversity were mapped onto the reconstructed mt phylogeny, and\na chronogram dating mayor cladogenetic events within the group was also\nreconstructed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_mit-nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112884.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_mit_nt","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112893.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_mit_aa","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112892.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST_2-calibration-points","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112891.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112896.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_mit-nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112895","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112895.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112894","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112894.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST_5-calibration-points","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112901.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_mit-nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112882.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112887","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112887.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_mit_nt","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112889","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112889.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_mit_aa","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112898","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112898.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_mit-nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112899","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112899.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_mit-nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112890","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112890.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_mit-nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112883","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112883.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_nuc_nt","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112897","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112897.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_mit_nt","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112888.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112886","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112886.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML_nuc_aa","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112900.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes_mit_aa","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112885","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112885.phy"}]}
