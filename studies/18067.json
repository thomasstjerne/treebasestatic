Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region shows that C. argutus and C.\nhedyaromaticus are separate, closely related species with rooting\nstipes. Cortinarius talus is a pale species with a bulbous stipe and a\nsweet odor similar to that of C. hedyaromaticus; C. argutus lacks this\nsweet odor. All three species have intercontinental distributions and\nare associated with deciduous trees, primarily Populus tremuloides, P.\ntremula, but also Salix sp. This study highlights the importance of the\nstudy of type specimens and molecular analysis to stabilize the\napplication of established names.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89428","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89428.phy"}]}
