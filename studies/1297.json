Sequences were analysed separately and in\ncombination with a mitochondrial dataset (cyt b, rRNAs 12S and 16S) used\nin previous publications. The basal polytomy of echimyids was partially\nresolved and unexpected intergeneric clades were recovered. Thus, the\nintimate nested position of Myocastor within echimyids is evidenced. A\nwell-supported clade is identified, including all the arboreal genera,\nand a group formed by Myocastor, Thrichomys and Proechimys + Hoplomys.\nThe clustering of Euryzygomatomys + Clyomys with Trinomys is also\nsuggested. On the opposite, the phylogenetic position of Capromys as\nwell as the relationships among arboreal genera remain unclear.\nMolecular divergence times were estimated using a Bayesian relaxed\nmolecular clock and suggest a Middle Miocene origin for most of modern\ngenera. The ecomorphological diversification of echimyids is discussed\nin the light of these new results and past environmental modifications\nin South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Echimyidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_234.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Echimyidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_302.phy"}]}
