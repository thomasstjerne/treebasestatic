It is characterized by lageniform sporocladia\nproduced acrogenously in mass and bears wet and fusiform spores on the\nsporocladia. Ramicandelaber brevisporus sp. nov. is distinguished from\nthe type species of the genus, R. longisporus, by producing much shorter\nasexual spores, (3-)8(-13) long fertile branches arising from a globose\nbody, and lateral branches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 NJ boot","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ramicandelaber ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47058.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 MP boot","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ramicandelaber ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 NJ orig","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ramicandelaber ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ramicandelaber (Kickxellales)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50217.phy"}]}
