Historically, their\nphylogenetic origins were obscured due to disagreement about which\nmorphological features are evolutionarily conserved, but now most\nmorphological evidence points to annelid origins. In contrast, recent\nphylogenetic analyses using different molecular markers produced\nvariable results regarding the position of myzostomids, but all\nsuggested these worms are not derived annelids. To re-examine this\nissue, we analyzed data from nuclear genes (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, Myosin\nII, and Elongation Factor-1ÔÅ°), and a nearly complete myzostomid\nmitochondrial genome. Here, we show that the molecular data are in\nagreement with the morphological evidence that myzostomids are part of\nthe annelid radiation. This result is robustly supported by\nmitochondrial (gene order and sequence data) and nuclear data, as well\nas by recent ultrastructural investigations. Using Bayes factor\ncomparison, alternative hypotheses are shown to lack support. Thus,\nmyzostomids probably evolved from a segmented ancestor and gained a\nderived anatomy during their long evolutionary history of echinoderm\nsymbionts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3D","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myzostomida and the Annelid Radiation","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_347.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3C","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myzostomida and the Annelid Radiation","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myzostomida and the Annelid Radiation","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myzostomida and the Annelid Radiation","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myzostomida and the Annelid Radiation","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2814.phy"}]}
