The accuracy of\nmtDNA gene trees is compromised through hybridization that leads to\nintrogression of mitochondrial genomes. Utilizing DNA sequences from six\nsingle copy nuclear genes and two regions of the mitochondrial genome,\nwe investigated the temporal and geographic signature of mitochondrial\nand nuclear introgression in the Etheostoma spectabile darter clade.\nPhylogenetic analyses of the nuclear genes result in the monophyly of\nthe E. spectabile clade; however, with respect to sampled specimens of\nfive species (E. fragi, E. uniporum, E. pulchellum, E. burri, and E.\nspectabile), the mitochondrial phylogeny is inconsistent with E.\nspectabile clade monophyly. Etheostoma uniporum and E. fragi are both\nfixed for heterospecific mitochondrial genomes. Limited nuclear\nintrogression is restricted to E. uniporum. Our analyses show the\npattern of introgression is consistently asymmetric, with movement of\nheterospecific mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear alleles into E.\nspectabile clade species, introgressive hybridization spans broad\ntemporal scales, and introgression is restricted to species and\npopulations in the Ozarks. The introgressed mitochondrial genome\nobserved in E. fragi has an obscure phylogenetic placement among\ndarters, an ancient age, and is possibly a mitochondrial fossil from an\nEtheostoma species that has subsequently gone extinct. These results\nindicate that introgression, both ancient and more contemporaneous,\ncharacterize the history of diversification in the E. spectabile species\nclade, and may be relatively common among clades comprising the\nspecies-rich North American freshwater fauna.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3205.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5c","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3206.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3207.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3208.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3209.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4c","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3210.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3211.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3212.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"170","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orangethroat Darters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3213.phy"}]}
