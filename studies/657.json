A nearly full-length fragment of the nuclear small subunit (SSU)\nrRNA of Amoebidium parasiticum was amplified by the polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) and sequenced to examine its phylogenetic relationships.\nResults of a BlastN search of GenBank revealed that the A. parasiticum\nSSU rRNA sequence was most closely related to Ichthyophonus hoferi, an\nichthysporean in the Protozoa near the animal-fungal divergence. Maximum\nparsimony analysis of ichthysporean and fungal SSU sequences, using\nsequences of choanoflagellates to root the 18S rDNA gene trees, resolved\nA. parasiticum as a strongly supported sister of I. hoferi within the\nIchthyophonida clade of the protozoan class Ichthysporea. In contrast to\nother members of this class which are mostly obligate or faculative\nparasities of various animals, A. parasiticum and other members of the\nAmoebidiales are only known to be arthropodophilous symbionts. The\nresults also provide the first evidence that mitochondrial cristae types\nexhibit homoplastic distributions within the Ichthysporea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amoebidiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3634.phy"}]}
