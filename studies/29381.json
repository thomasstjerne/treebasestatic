This species of mistletoe has one\nof the widest host ranges of the genus, infecting native and non-native\nspecies trees of commercial interest and is a keystone species in\ninteraction networks between plants, mutualist pollinators, and seed\ndispersers. De novo transcriptome assembly and bioinformatics analyses\nwere performed on inoculated seeds at various stages of development\n(from seed inoculation to haustoria formation) in order to describe\nchanges in the de novo assembled transcriptome, gene expression profiles\nof experimentally inoculated seeds across time and. to underline the\nprocesses of attachment and haustorial formation.
