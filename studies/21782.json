Fuscosporella\naquatica has sporodochial colonies, irregular ellipsoidal and dark brown\nconidia with vesicular conidiogenous cells. Mucispora phangngaensis has\nmacronematous, solitary conidiophores with percurrent proliferations and\ndark brown obovoid conidia. Phylogenetic analysis based on combined LSU\nand ITS sequence data support their placement in Fuscosporella and\nMucispora (Fuscosporellaceae, Fuscosporellales). Both species formed\ndistinct clades from their type species and present as the second\nspecies in each genus. Descriptions and illustrations of the new taxa\nare provided. DNA sequence data of Parafuscosporella mucosa (from\nex-type strain) are provided in this study, and confirmed its\nphylogenetic placement.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113339.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113340.phy"}]}
