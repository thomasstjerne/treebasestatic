Three ï¿½\ncompletely reddish species were recognized: C. sanguineus (syn. C.\nsanguineus var. aurantiovaginatus), C. puniceus (syn. C. cruentus, C.\nrubrosanguineus), and C. vitiosus comb. nov. Cortinarius sanguineus has\nblood red pileus, ï¿½ orange mycelium, and not or only slightly\nencrusted hyphae in pileipellis. It occurs in mesic to damp forests with\nPicea, often on rich soil in the boreal and montane areas of Europe,\npresumably also in Eastern Canada. C. puniceus differs from the former\nby stronger purplish red color, narrower spores, and spot-like encrusted\nhyphae in pileipellis. It grows with deciduous trees in the temperate\nzone of Europe. C. vitiosus is only known from Fennoscandia and occurs\nin dryish to mesic coniferous forests. It has thin, often zonate, dark\nred to brownish pileus, pinkish mycelium, small spores, and encrusted\nlamellar trama and pileipellis hyphae. In addition to these three\nspecies, C. fervidus and C. phoeniceus occasionally have reddish\nfruitbodies. The relationships of the species were inferred by analysis\nof ITS. Our study shows that the previous classifications of the group\nSanguinei are polyphyletic. Here, the section is limited to include C.\nsanguineus, C. puniceus and North American D. sierraensis. The\nrelationships of the other species with red colors were not solved. Of\nthe other groups of Dermocybe, the sect. Dermocybe, including C.\ncinnamomeus, C. croceus and C. uliginosus, formed a monophyletic group\nand the placement of the section Malicoriae as a separate clade was\nsomewhat supported. A total of 34 new sequences are published including\nnine type sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius sanguineus group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46875.phy"}]}
