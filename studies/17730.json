Here we use a metagenomic approach to\nidentify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus\nassociated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include\ndistant relatives of known insect pathogens, but also novel groups of\ninsect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs we show\nthat the viruses are active infections of Drosophila. We find that the\nRNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and\nwe detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of\nsmall RNAs also allows us to identify putative virus sequences that lack\ndetectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying >2000\nindividually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30%\nof D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry\nmultiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia\nendosymbiontwhich is known to be protective against virus infections in\nDrosophilawe were unable to detect any relationship between the presence\nof Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available\nRNA-seq datasets we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila\nlaboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some\nof the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in\nlaboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing\nviruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses\nare shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Our results provide\nan essential evolutionary and ecological context for host-virus\ninteraction in Drosophila, and the newly reported virus sequences will\nhelp develop D. melanogaster further as a model for molecular and\nevolutionary virus research","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88252","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88252.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88250.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88249.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88254","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88254.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88246.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88248.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88251.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88258","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88258.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88245.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88259.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88247.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88253.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88255","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88255.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88256","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88256.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88257","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88257.phy"}]}
