This\nspecies differs morphologically from other species in the genus by\nhaving a relatively thick, simple, columnar synnemata, a crustous mass\nat the apex of the synnemata, and two types of conidia, globose to\nsubglobose and fusiform; phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS region\nindicates that this is an undescribed species in the genus. A\nmorphological comparison of this species with specimens recorded, but\nnot described, in Hokkaido revealed that this species is\nEniwaÂ–semitake.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135562","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135562.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135585","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135585.phy"}]}
