However,\nnew small-diameter muscle fibres can be produced de novo in aged fish\nafter muscle injury. Given that virtually nothing is known regarding the\ntranscriptional mechanisms that regulate regenerative myogenesis in\nadult fish, we explored the temporal changes in gene expression during\ntrout muscle regeneration following mechanical crushing. Then, we\ncompared the gene transcription profiles of regenerating muscle with the\npreviously reported gene expression signature associated with muscle\nfibre hyperplasia. Results: Using an Agilent-based microarray platform\nwe conducted a time-course analysis of transcript expression in 29 month\nold trout muscle before injury (time 0) and at the site of injury 1, 8,\n16 and 30 days after lesions were made. We identified more than 7000\nunique differentially expressed transcripts that segregated into four\nmajor clusters with distinct temporal profiles and functional\ncategories. Functional categories related to response to wounding,\nresponse to oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and angiogenesis\nwere inferred from the early up-regulated genes, while functions related\nto cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodelling, muscle\ndevelopment and myofibrillogenesis were inferred from genes up-regulated\n30 days post-lesion, when new small myofibres were visible at the site\nof injury. Remarkably, a large set of genes previously reported to be\nup-regulated in hyperplastic muscle growth areas was also found to be\noverexpressed at 30 days post-lesion, indicating that many features of\nthe transcriptional program underlying muscle hyperplasia are\nreactivated when new myofibres are transiently produced during fish\nmuscle regeneration. Conclusion: The results of the present study\ndemonstrate a coordinated expression of functionally related genes\nduring muscle regeneration in fish. Furthermore, this study generated a\nuseful list of novel genes associated with muscle regeneration that will\nallow further investigations on the genes, pathways or biological\nprocesses involved in muscle growth and regeneration in\nvertebrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myoblast determination protein 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98642.phy"}]}
