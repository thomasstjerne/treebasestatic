All but two subfamilies are\nrecovered as monophyletic. Divergence time estimates calibrated by\nminimum age constraints from 43 fossils indicate that most of the\nsubfamilies representing extant ants arose much earlier than previously\nproposed but only began to diversify during the Late Cretaceous to Early\nEocene. This period also witnessed the rise of angiosperms and most\nherbivorous insects.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of the Ants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4614.phy"}]}
