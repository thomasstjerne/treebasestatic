Under this view, sexual groups\nshould be more variable than asexual groups within populations (because\nof recombination), but less variable among populations (because of gene\nflow). This prediction is tested using 23 sympatric species in the moss\ngenus Tortula in Mexico. Reproduction in this group ranges from\nfrequently sexual to completely asexual, as measured by frequency of\nsporophyte production. Species distinctness is compared using two\napproaches. In the first, distinctness is measured cladistically as the\nnumber of autapomorphies present. In the second, distinctness is\nmeasured phenetically through morphometric studies. The result is the\nsame under either approach: there is no particular correlation between\nmode of reproduction and species distinctness. It is concluded that\nprocesses other than interbreeding may be responsible for species\nformation and maintenance even in sexual groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tortula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1444.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tortula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1443.phy"}]}
