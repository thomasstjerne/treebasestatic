In this study,\nfruiting structures resembling those of Cryphonectriaceae were collected\nand isolated from dying branches of Syzygium cordatum and root collars\nof Heteropyxis natalensis in South Africa, and from cankers on the bark\nof Tibouchina grandifolia in La Réunion. A phylogenetic species concept\nwas used to identify these fungi using partial sequences of the Large\nSubunit and Internal Transcribed Spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal\nDNA, and two regions of the β-tubulin gene. The results revealed a new\ngenus and species in the Cryphonectriaceae from South Africa that was\nnamed Myrtonectria myrtacearum. Two new species of Celoporthe were\ndescribed from the La Réunion collections, Celoporthe borbonica sp. nov.\nand Celoporthe tibouchinae sp. nov. The new taxa were mildly pathogenic\nin pathogenicity tests on a clone of Eucalyptus grandis. Similar to\nother related taxa in the Cryphonectriaceae, they appear to be\nendophytes and latent pathogens that could threaten Eucalyptus forestry\nin the future.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrtonectria LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celoporthe BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115920.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celoporthe ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115924.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrtonectria BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrtonectria ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celoporthe ITS BT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115919.phy"}]}
