Based on morphology and DNA sequence\ndata, the Botryosphaeriales have to date been shown to contain eight\nfamilies, of which the Botryosphaeriaceae is the best represented with\nmolecular data. Furthermore, Oblongocollomyces is introduced as new\ngenus, while Spencermartinsia is reduced to synonymy under Dothiorella.\nNovel species include Diplodia pyri (Pyrus sp., the Netherlands),\nDiplodia citricarpa (Citrus sp., Iran), Lasiodiplodia vitis (Vitis\nvinifera, Italy), L. sterculiae (Sterculia oblonga, Germany),\nNeofusicoccum pistaciarum (Pistacia vera, USA), N. buxi (Buxus\nsempervirens, France), N. stellenboschiana (Vitis vinifera, South\nAfrica), and Saccharata hawaiiensis (Protea laurifolia, Hawaii). New\ncombinations are also proposed for Camarosporium pistaciae (associated\nwith fruit rot of Pistacia vera) in Neofusicoccum, and Sphaeria gallae\n(associated with galls of Quercus) in Diplodia. The combination of\nLSU-rpb2 proved effective at delineating taxa at family and generic\nlevel. Furthermore, rpb2 also added additional resolution for species\ndelimitation, in combination with ITS, tef1 and tub2. In this study we\nanalysed 499 isolates, and produce an expanded phylogenetic backbone for\nBotryosphaeriales, which will help to delimit novelties at species,\ngenus and family level in future.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1 Unpublished RAxML
