Two coelomycetous taxa belonging\nto two different genera in Xylariomycetidae, Sordariomycetes, namely\nDiscosia and Sporocadus, were identified. Multi-locus phylogenies based\non the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU), Internal Transcribed\nSpacer (ITS) and Î²-tubulin (tub2) sequence data revealed that the\nDiscosia species is basal to D. neofraxinea and forms an independent\nlineage. The latter is also different from other Discosia species by its\nunilocular to bilocular, superficial and applanate conidiomata along\nwith elongate-ampulliform conidiogenous cells attenuated at the base and\nconidia smaller in size. It is introduced as Discosia ravennica sp.nov.\nOur second taxon collected is a new host record from Italy and\nmorphological observations coupled with multigene phylogeny support that\nit is Sporocadus rosigena. Descriptions, illustrations and molecular\ndata for both species are provided in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127263","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127263.phy"}]}
