This yeast is not well-studied in the\nPhilippines. Considering that identification to species level is\nnecessary for empirical treatment of diseases it causes, and the\ndifficulty in its identification using phenotypic methods, use of\npolyphasic assays is explored. Increasing yeast infections and drug\nresistance worldwide necessitate isolation and identification of C.\nalbicans in its surveillance in the country. Study identified clinical\nisolates from two tertiary hospitals in Metro Manila using phenotypic\nand genotypic methods. Twenty-six clinical isolates were identified\nphenotypically using germ tube and chlamydospore production and carbon\nassimilation of glucose, maltose, galactose, and sucrose. Genotypic\nidentification was done by determining internal transcribed space (ITS)\nsequences and construction of neighbor-joining tree using ITS sequences.\nTwelve isolates were phenotypically identified as C. albicans, while one\nisolate was identified as C. parapsilosis. These identities were\nconfirmed at the ITS level. Yeast isolates that could not be identified\nphenotypically were identified as C. albicans following genotypic\nanalysis. Genotypic identification is the gold standard for\nidentification of C. albicans. Polyphasic approach in fungal\nidentification provides a plethora of phenotypic and genotypic\nproperties, which creates robust and accurate results.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 5 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107590","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107590.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 1 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107586","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 2 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107587","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 3 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107588","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 4 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107589","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 10 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 6 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 7 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 8 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 9 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107594.phy"}]}
