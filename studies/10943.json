Isolates of P.\nsclerotioides exhibit diverse cultural morphologies on potato dextrose\nagar (PDA), suggesting that they may exhibit a high degree of genetic\ndiversity. To investigate the genetic relatedness of P. sclerotioides\nisolates, 154 isolates from North America were sequenced at ten loci.\nMaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the complete\n10-locus dataset placed isolates into multiple strongly supported\nclades, and analyses of gene-jackknife and single-gene partitions of the\ndataset indicated robust support for six major clades and three\nsubclades. Genetic differences corresponded closely to differences in\nconidial size and septation, pycnidial neck length, mycelial\npigmentation, and growth rate in axenic culture at 18°C and 25°C.\nIsolates exhibited morphologies broadly consistent with the species\ndescription of P. sclerotioides, and new species were not designated. On\nthe basis of genetic and morphological differences, we propose\nestablishing seven infraspecific varieties within P. sclerotioides: P.\nsclerotioides var. sclerotioides, champlainii, viridis, obscurus,\nsteubenii, macrospora, and saskatchewanii. All varieties of P.\nsclerotioides caused brown root rot of alfalfa and grew well at low\ntemperatures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25384.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 118564","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25385.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25386.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25370","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25370.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25371.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 39828","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25374","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25374.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25375","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25375.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25373","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25373.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25376","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25376.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25377","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25377.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25378.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9819","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25379.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25380.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25381.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25382.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25383.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23027","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25372","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25372.phy"}]}
