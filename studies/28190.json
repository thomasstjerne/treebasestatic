Pyrenodesmia rugosa is\ndistinguishable from Pyrenodesmia micromontana (Frolov, Wilk &\nVondrák) Hafellner & Türk, the most similar species, by thicker\nthallus, rugose areoles, larger apothecia, shorter hymenium, shorter\nhypothecium and narrower tip cells of paraphyses. Squamulea aeruginosa,\nthe second new species, differs from Squamulea chelonia Bungartz &\nSøchting by dark greenish gray to gray thallus without pruina, gold to\nyellow-brown epihymenium, larger ascospores, and thallus K and KC\nreaction. Molecular analyses employing internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS), mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU), and nuclear large subunit\nribosomal RNA (LSU) sequences strongly support the two caloplacoid\nspecies to be distinct in their genera. A surrogate key is provided to\nassist in the identification of all 17 taxa in Squamulea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for ML","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130916.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for ML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia mtSSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130917.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia mtSSU Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 for ML","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia LSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenodesmia LSU Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130920.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 for ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamulea ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamulea ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130922.phy"}]}
