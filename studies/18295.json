However, given its broad\ngeographic distribution, the striking diversity in reproductive\nbehaviors, and the lack of synapomorphy for the genus, the monophyly of\nEpiactis is questionable. Here we perform phylogenetic analyses to test\nthe monophyly of Epiactis and the validity of Cnidopus, which consists\nentirely of species once assigned to Epiactis. We use the large number\nof brooding species in Epiactis to investigate evolutionary patterns in\nbrooding modes and characteristics associated with them. We find a\nmonophyletic group of North Pacific Epiactis species: this group\nincludes the type species of the genus and includes species that brood\ninternally or externally, and that are hermaphroditic or gonochoric.\nBased on the results, we reject the genus Cnidopus because its\ncircumscription renders Epiactis sensu stricto paraphyletic. Ancestral\ncharacter state reconstruction indicates that in the North Pacific,\nexternally brooding species evolved from internally brooding ancestors\nand that sex allocation is highly labile. Contrary to expectations based\non other invertebrates, we fail to find a strong correlation between\nbrooding and mode of sex allocation.
