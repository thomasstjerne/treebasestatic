This\nlarge, smooth and conical plate entirely covering the snout constitutes\none of the most derived case of reduction of the number of scales in the\nrostral region, an evolutionary trend clearly associated to the\nburrowing lifestyle. Here we performed a multilocus phylogenetic\nanalysis of combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the fossorial\ngenus Paracontias, including a new species described herein, and\nassembled a qualitative morphological study of the cephalic scalation\nwithin this genus. Our analyses allowed us to investigate the evolution\nof “fusion” of the scales of the snout into a single large rostral\nshield. We discuss the evolutionary process that may have operated, and\nhypothesize some of the adaptative advantages such a structure may\nprovide in terms of functional morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paracontias Skinks","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26690.phy"}]}
