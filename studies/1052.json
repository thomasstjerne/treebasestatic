{"Authors":" Hermann Voglmayr","Year":" 2003","Title":" Phylogenetic relationships of Peronospora and related genera\nbased on nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences.","Journal":" Molecular Ecology","Volume":" 107","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" In order to investigate phylogenetic relationships of\nselected members of Peronosporaceae of the genera Pythium,\nHalophytophthora, Phytophthora, and Peronophythora, Bayesian analysis of\npartial sequences of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was performed. In\naddition, sequences of the complete ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region were analysed\nfor 101 collections belonging to the genera Peronospora,\nHyaloperonospora, Perofascia, Pseudoperonospora, Phytophthora and\nPeronophythora, using Bayesian inference of phylogeny and maximum\nparsimony. The results confirm a close relationship of these genera. The\nstrongly supported Peronosporaceae clade is located within the\nparaphyletic genus Phytophthora (including Peronophythora). Monophyly of\nthe genera Pseudoperonospora, Hyaloperonospora and Perofascia each are\nstrongly supported, but monophyly of Peronospora s. str. can neither be\nconfirmed nor rejected. Within Peronospora s. str., basic relationships\noften remain unclear; however, some groups form highly supported\nmonophyletic clades. Peronospora species parasitising the same host\nfamilies or orders are only partly resolved as monophyletic, indicating\nfrequent host-jumping also between distantly related host families. All\nspecies inhabiting flowers of different host families form a strongly\nsupported monophyletic group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4206.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4203.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4204.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4205.phy"}]}
