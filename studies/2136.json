The distinction between Pennisetum and Cenchrus is\nnot clearly defined, and currently, no comprehensive taxonomic treatment\nis available for either genus. Chloroplast DNA sequence data (rpl16 and\ntrnL-F region) were analyzed to test their monophyly, species\nrelationships, and infrageneric classifications. Phylogenetic analyses\nof individual genomic regions, and a combined dataset, including\nindel-coded information, were performed under parsimony. Bayesian\ninference analyses were also performed for the individual and combined\ndatasets. Selected geographical, chromosomal and diagnostic\nmorphological characters were mapped onto the phylogeny to investigate\nevolutionary trends. Our results support a monophyletic bristle clade\nand the close relationship between Pennisetum and Cenchrus. Excluding\nPennisetum lanatum, Pennisetum is paraphyletic because Cenchrus is\nnested within it. Sections Pennisetum and Gymnotrix are polyphyletic,\nwhile the relationship of other sections and the diagnostic characters\nused to identify infrageneric taxa, are also discussed. Our molecular\nphylogenetic results show a close relationship among the domesticated\nspecies P. glaucum, and P. purpureum, P. squamulatum, P. nervosum, and\nP. sieberianum, suggesting the potential use of these species in crop\nimprovement. The Pennisetum-Cenchrus clade shows an independent\nreduction ( x = 5, 7, 8 ) or duplication ( x = 17 ) of the basic\nchromosome number from the ancestral x = 9. American Pennisetum and\nCenchrus species appear to have originated from Old World species more\nthan once during the evolution. A core group of American species of\nCenchrus with a basic chromosome number of x = 17, and retrorsely barbed\nbristles could be restricted to Cenchrus s.s.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PI trnL-F + PI rpl16","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_373.phy"},{"tree_label":"PI rpl16 + PI coded indels","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5272.phy"},{"tree_label":"optimization tree","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5271.phy"},{"tree_label":"PI trnL-F + PI coded indels","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5273.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5274.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F + rpl16 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pennisetum and Cenchrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5275.phy"}]}
