Two mitochondrial markers (COI & 16S) and a set of\nnuclear markers (H3, ITS2 and 28S) were used in Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nand Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses. The synopsis of molecular and\nanatomical data provide a first insight into the phylogenetic\nrelationships of these groups. The existence of a split between\nEuropean, Macaronesian and African genera is proven. The direct\nrelationship between the Macaronesian group and described new East\nAfrican genus Sanettivitrina scripta nov. gen. nov. sp. as a relic of\nthis radiation is demonstrated. The separation of the other East African\nVitrinidae into two clades, viz.Â Arabivitrina Thiele, 1931 and\nCalidivitrina Pilsbry, 1919, could not be confirmed. The hitherto used\nmorphologically-based generic definitions are not able to explain the\nexistence of at least five lineages. Apparently, the genital organs of\nthe Arabivitrina and Calidivitrina type developed several times in\nparallel. There is evidence that the fully limacised family Limacidae\nrepresents the sister taxon to the Vitrinidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122380.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122381.phy"}]}
