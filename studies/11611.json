The systematics\nwithin the genus has gained little attention and this is a first attempt\nto shed some light over the systematics of Boletina and to test the\nsegregation of the genera Saigusaia and Aglaomyia from Boletina. The\nnuclear marker 28S and mitochondrial 16S, COI and CytB were amplified\nand sequenced for 23 taxa that were analysed separately and together\nwith a broad sample of outgroup taxa obtained from GenBank, where also\n18S sequences were added. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum\nlikelihood, Bayesian inference, and parsimony. We strengthen the\nhypothesized sistergroup relationship between Docosia and Boletina, but\nthe genus Boletina as currently delimited appears to be paraphyletic and\nnested in a clade together with Aglaomyia, Coelosia and Gnoriste. The\ngenus Saigusaia, on the other hand, seems to be well separated from\nBoletina. The Boletina erythropyga-species group is consistently found\nas a distinct basal clade within Boletina s.l. The results obtained are\notherwise ambiguous both for the taxa in focus and in some analyses\nglobally with a statistically supported total breakdown of the\ntraditional higher classification into tribes, subfamilies and even\nfamilies. Interestingly, this breakdown almost disappeared when\nadditional 18S sequences were added.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46478.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46479.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46481.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46482.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46480.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fungus Gnat Genus Boletina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46483.phy"}]}
