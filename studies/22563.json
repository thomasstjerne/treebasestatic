Phylogenetic\nanalyses based on sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer\nregion, partial fragments of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase and the translation elongation factor 1-Î± genes, supported\nthe introduction of 13 novel Curvularia species. Eight of the species\ndescribed, namely, C. beasleyi sp. nov., C. beerburrumensis sp. nov., C.\neragrosticola sp. nov., C. kenpeggii sp. nov., C. mebaldsii sp. nov., C.\npetersonii sp. nov., C. platzii sp. nov. and C. warraberensis sp. nov.,\nwere isolated from grasses (Poaceae) exotic to Australia. Only two\nspecies, C. lamingtonensis sp. nov. and C. sporobolicola sp. nov., were\ndescribed from native Australian grasses. Two species were described\nfrom hosts in other families, namely, C. coatesiae sp. nov. from Litchi\nchinensis (Sapindaceae) and C. colbranii sp. nov. from Crinum zeylanicum\n(Amaryllidaceae). Curvularia reesii sp. nov. was described from an\nisolate obtained from an air sample. Furthermore, DNA sequences from\nex-type cultures supported the generic placement of C. neoindica and the\ntransfer of Drechslera boeremae to Curvularia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Curvularia ITS gapdh tef1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112852.phy"}]}
