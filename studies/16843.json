(Davidiaceae), commonly known\nas âChinese dove treeâ is a Tertiary relic deciduous species endemic to\nChina, and has been listed as an endangered species. Little is known\nabout the genetic structure, population history and possible Quaternary\nrefugium area of D. involucrata. However, the population information is\nessential for designing efficient conservation strategies to protect the\nendangered species from becoming extinct in the wild. Both cpDNA and\nnSSR markers showed high genetic diversity within D. involucrata\npopulations (HS = 0.717; hT = 0.893;pT = 3.14 Ã 10-3). The genetic\ndivergence of all D. involucrata populations detected in cpDNA (FST =\n0.765) was significantly higher than nuclear DNA (FST = 0.239), possibly\nreflecting a more important role for pollen dispersal compared to seed.\nResults from phylogeographic analyses suggested that the populations of\nD. involucrata were divided into Southwest and Central China lineages,\nwhich is consistent with the floristic boundary separating the\nSino-Himalayan and Sino-Japanese Forest subkingdoms. Divergence of the\ntwo lineages was estimated to have occurred around 4.81 Mya during the\nLate Miocene/Early Pliocene. Mismatch distribution and neutrality tests\ndidn’t show significant population growth and range expansion in either\nlineage, suggesting the in situ survival of several isolated D.\ninvolucrata populations during the Quaternary glaciation without range\nexpansion. Our cpDNA data suggested two potential refugia in Southwest\nand Central China. Conservation efforts should be directed at\npopulations in both refugial areas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3.","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis based on cpDNA sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80227.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3.","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian analysis based on cpDNA sequence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80228.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8.","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BEAST-derived chronograms of Davidia and its outgroup\nbased on cpDNA (trnLâ“rpl32F, trnSâ“trnG) sequences with fossil-based\nnode constrains","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80229.phy"}]}
