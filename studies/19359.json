Here, we investigate biogeographic patterns in a widely\ndistributed isidiate taxon - Parmelinella wallichiana - using molecular\nsequence data. Our results revealed that Parmelinella wallichina, as\ncurrently circumscribed, is not monophyletic but falls into four clades,\ntwo of them represented by a sample only. A third clade, occurring in\nAfrica and southern India is described as a new species, Parmelinella\nschimperiana Kirika & Divakar, sp. nov. Further, P. wallichiana\ns.str. is epitypfied with a specimen from northern India to stabilize\nthe use of the name. Our study adds a further example of previously\noverlooked, geographically distinct, lineages that were discovered using\nmolecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96369.phy"}]}
