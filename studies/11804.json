Passalora californica\nrepresents a new pathogen on Asclepias fascicularis, while Ramularia\ncynarae is confirmed on Carthamus tinctorius and Cynara cardunculus\n(Asteraceae), and an epitype designated. Pathogenicity is also\nestablished for both pathogens based on KochÂ’s postulate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercosporoid leaf pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47816.phy"}]}
