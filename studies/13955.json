With such a wide host\nrange, they constitute a good model for studying the adaptation to the\nhost. Additionally, several lines of evidence link birnaviruses to\npositive strand RNA viruses and suggest that phylogenetic analyses may\nprovide clues about transition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61106.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61107.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61108","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61108.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree for segment B (VP1)","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61109","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61109.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61118","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61115","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61115.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61113","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61113.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61114","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61114.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61116.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61117.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61119","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61119.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61120","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61121","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61121.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61122","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61122.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61123","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61123.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61111","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61111.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61110.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat+","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61112","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61112.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Tree for Segment A","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61104","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61104.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61124","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61124.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61105","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61105.phy"}]}
