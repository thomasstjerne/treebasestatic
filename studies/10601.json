Although higher level relationships within\nCaesalpinioideae are now better understood, few studies have examined\ngeneric and species level relationships. A morphological and molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of selected members of the Brownea clade\n(Detarieae: Caesalpinioideae) is presented here, focusing on\nrelationships within and amongst the genera Elizabetha, Heterostemon,\nPaloveopsis, and Paloue. Morphological characters (125) and DNA sequence\ndata from the plastid trnL intron and nuclear ITS were used to\nreconstruct phlogenetic relationships. These results indicate that (1)\nHeterostemon is monophyletic; (2) the majority of Elizabetha species\nform a poorly supported, monophyletic group sister to Paloue; and (3)\nPaloveopsis is nested within a Paloue. Intergeneric hybridization\nbetween species of Paloue and Elizabetha has been identified and\ntraditional generic, species, and intra-species boundaries are assessed\nand reevaluated using the results of the combined phylogenetic\nanalysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Northeastern South American Brownea clade of tribe\nDetarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9798.phy"}]}
