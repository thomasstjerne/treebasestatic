Among them, nine\nspecies, P. burdsallii, P. cinerea, P. hymenochaetoides, P.\nleptocystidiata, P. metuloidea, P. minor, P. sinensis, P. subrosea and\nP. yunnanensis are described and illustrated as new to science.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123288","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123288.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123289.phy"}]}
