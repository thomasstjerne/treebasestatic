Phylogenetic analyses of the mtDNA 12S rDNA, cytochrome\noxidase I, control region, and restriction sites data, identified three\nmajor haplotype clades. The Northwest clade (NW) includes both\nsubspecies of A. boreas and divergent minor clades in the middle Rocky\nMountains, coastal, and central regions of the west and Pacific\nNorthwest. The Southwest (SW) clade includes A. exsul, A. nelsoni, and\nminor clades in southern California. Anaxyrus canorus, previously\nidentified as paraphyletic, has populations in both the NW and SW major\nclades. The Eastern major clade (E) includes three divergent lineages\nfrom southern Utah, the southern Rocky Mountains, and north of the Great\nBasin at the border of Utah and Nevada. These results identify new\ngenetic variation in the eastern portion of the toad\u001as range and are\nconsistent with previous regional studies from the west coast. Low\nlevels of control region sequence divergence between major clades\n(2.2-4.7 % uncorrected pair-wise distances) are consistent with\nPleistocene divergence and suggest that the phylogeographic history of\nthe group was heavily influenced by dynamic Pleistocene glacial and\nclimatic changes, and especially pluvial changes, in western North\nAmerica. Results reported here may impact conservation plans in that the\ncurrent taxonomy does not reflect the diversity in the group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Unrooted","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anaxyrus boreas group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Unrooted","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anaxyrus boreas group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 sup.
