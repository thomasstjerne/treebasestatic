A new species Rhizochaete belizensis\nis described, and three new combinations are proposed. Morphological\nstudies and molecular sequence data from two nuclear ribosomal DNA\nregions (ITS and LSU) support the recognition of R. belizensis which is\nclosely related to R. radicata. Analyses of sequence data also support\nthe transfer of Phanerochaete ava to Rhizochaete. Phanerochaete\npercitrina from Cameroon and Peniophora rhizomorpho-sulphurea from India\nare transferred to Rhizochaete based on morphological studies of type\nspecimens. Phanerochaete rubescens from Taiwan is placed in synonymy\nunder R. borneensis. In addition, Phanerochaete mauiensis is redescribed\nand illustrated. A key to 13 accepted species of Rhizochaete and three\nmorphologically similar species is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100343.phy"}]}
