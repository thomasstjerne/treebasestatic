We use comparative analyses to investigate whether the\nremarkable geographic variation of dewlap color and pattern in\nHispaniolan trunk Anolis lizards (Anolis distichus) is a result of\nadaptive signal divergence to heterogeneous environments. We recover a\nrepeated pattern of divergence in A. distichus dewlap color, pattern and\nsize with environmental variation across Hispaniola. These results are\naligned with ecological models of signal divergence and provide strong\nevidence for dewlap adaptation to local signaling environments. We also\nfind that A. distichus dewlaps vary with the environment in a different\nmanner to other previously studied anoles, thus expanding upon previous\npredictions on the direction dewlaps will diverge in perceptual color\nspace in response to the environment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ultrametric tree from BEAST analyses on Anolis\ndistichus mtDNA dataset under a coalescent model","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57236.phy"}]}
