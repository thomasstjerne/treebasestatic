The ndhF gene varies in\nlength from 2103 to 2196 bp due to the presence of deletions (up to 93\nbp) in the 30 region. The ndhF results presented here are largely\ncongruent with previous trees from rbcL sequence and chloroplast DNA\nrestriction site analyses, especially in recognizing the four\nchromosomal clades (x 1⁄4 10, 8, 7, and 6). The ndhF tree indicates\nstrong support for the sister group relationship between the\nmorphologically distinctive genus Nandina (x 1⁄4 10) and the\nCaulophyllum group (x1⁄48), which provides additional evidence for\nretaining Nandina within Berberidaceae. However, phylogenetic\nrelationships among the three other chromosomal clades remain\nunresolved. Within the x 1⁄4 6 group, the basal position of Jeffer-\nsonia/Plagiorhegma and the monophyly of the Podophyllum group are\nevident, whereas the position of Achlys is uncertain. In contrast to the\ntraditional morphological view, the Sino- podophyllum/Dysosma clade is\nmore closely related to Diphylleia than to Podophyllum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berberidaceae ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49835.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Berberidaceae ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49834.phy"}]}
