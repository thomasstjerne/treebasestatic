We focused on B. fremontii and\nsection Implexae in order to determine whether secondary chemistry is\ncorrelated with photobiont identity. DNA from two loci for photobionts\nand three loci for mycobionts was sequenced for both parsimony and\nBayesian phylogenetic analyses. A comparison of photobiont and mycobiont\nphylogenies reveals that most Bryoria species associate exclusively with\nlineages of the Trebouxia simplex group; only B. smithii was associated\nwith a different photobiont. We conclude that most Bryoria species\nincluded in our study are highly selective in their choice of algal\npartners and that the presence/concentration of different secondary\ncompounds does not correlate with photobiont identity either in section\nImplexae or in B. fremontii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bryoria photobiont ITS and COX2 consensus","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77460","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77460.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bryoria_ITS_mtSSU_GAPDH_consensus","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77457","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77457.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bryoria photobiont ITS phylogeny","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77458","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77458.phy"}]}
