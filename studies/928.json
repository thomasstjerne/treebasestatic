Canha, G. sp. Ladoeiro), ((G. pallida, G. rostochiensis),\n(P. chalcoensis, P. punctata)))), Heterodera avenae). Globodera sp. from\nPortugal, which can be confused with potato cyst nematodes by\nphytosanitary services when the identification is based only on\nmorphological characters, is clearly different based on our molecular\ndata. In addition, the rDNA data show the Globodera sp. to be only\ndistantly related to other European Globodera species that parasitize\nAsteraceae. Punctodera chalcoensis and P. punctata form a sister clade\nto the G. pallida + G. rostochiensis clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MAN PARS 3","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3999.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAN PARS 4","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4000.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAN ML","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4001.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera, default alignment ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3996.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAN PARS 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3997.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAN PARS 2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3998.phy"},{"tree_label":"DEF PARS 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3994.phy"},{"tree_label":"DEF PARS 2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3995.phy"}]}
