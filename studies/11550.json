We tested\ndifferent models of lineage and phenotypic diversification in an\nexceptional continental radiation, the ovenbird family Furnariidae,\nusing the most complete species-level phylogenetic hypothesis produced\nto date for a major avian clade (97% of 293 species). We found that the\nFurnariidae exhibit nearly constant rates of lineage accumulation but\nshow evidence of constrained morphological evolution. This pattern of\nsustained high rates of speciation despite limitations on phenotypic\nevolution contrasts with the results of most previous studies of\nevolutionary radiations, which have found a pattern of decelerating\ndiversity-dependent lineage accumulation coupled with decelerating or\nconstrained phenotypic evolution. Our results suggest that lineage\naccumulation in tropical continental radiations may not be as limited by\necological opportunities as in temperate or island radiations. More\nstudies examining patterns of both lineage and phenotypic\ndiversification are needed to understand the often complex tempo and\nmode of evolutionary radiations on continents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"297","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46192","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46192.phy"}]}
