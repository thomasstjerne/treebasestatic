Because these attributes in turn could influence the abundance\nand impact of species, phylogenetic information could be useful in\npredicting the likely status of pests. In this study, we used regional\n(China) and global datasets to investigate phylogenetic patterns in\noccurrence patterns and host ranges of spider mites, which constitute a\npest group of many cropping systems worldwide. We found significant\nphylogenetic signal in relative abundance and distribution range both at\nthe regional and global scales. Relative abundance and range size of\nspider mites were positively correlated with host range, although these\ncorrelations became weaker after controlling for phylogeny. The results\nsuggest that pest impacts are evolutionarily constrained. Information\nthat is readily easily obtainable  including the number of known hosts\nand phylogenetic position of the mites  could therefore be useful in\npredicting future pest risk of species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119855","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119855.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119856","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119856.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119857.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119858.phy"}]}
