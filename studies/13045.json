It is\nknown from an incomplete but associated skeleton that includes cranial\nand post−cranial remains. Demandasaurus darwini gen. et sp. nov.\npresents 9 autapomorphies in the teeth and vertebrae. Demandasaurus is\nthe first diplodocoid sauropod described from the Cretaceous of the\nIberian Peninsula. Its inclusion in the Rebbachisauridae is well\nsupported by our phylogenetic hypothesis, which situates it as a sister\ngroup of Nigersaurus from the Aptian of Niger, with which it shares\nvarious synapomorphies. The discovery of Demandasaurus provides further\nevidence of the sporadic use of the Apulian Route by dinosaurs during\nthe Early Cretaceous for moving between the south of Europe (Laurasia)\nand the north of Africa (Gondwana).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 14A","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55317.phy"}]}
