Using 16 published sequences of the large subunit of rubisco\n(rbcL), also from a wide range of angiosperm families, another\nphylogenetic tree was derived and the two approaches were compared. Both\nphylogenetic trees gave good grouping within families but in neither\ncase was there resolution of the branching order of major taxa.\nSuperficially the long rbcL sequences (whose base composition was\nhomogeneous among all species) seemed very promising, but analysis\nshowed that a large proportion of the variation did not affect the amino\nacid sequence. Although silent substitution contained some phylogenetic\ninformation, at the level required to order major taxa, much of it was\nrandom and obfuscating. It was concluded that neither macromolecule\nalone was likely to yield a solution to the problem of angiosperm\nphylogeny and therefore that studies of both, at least, will be\nrequired. For this reason, a method was described for obtaining both DNA\nand RNA of good quality from the same preparation and which had been\nused successfully with a wide range of species including many with\npungent leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4239.phy"}]}
