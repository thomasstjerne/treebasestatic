The\ncomplete mtDNA cytochrome b gene (cytb) and the second intron of the\nRAG1 gene were sequenced from multiple spec- imens of each species and\nanalyzed using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. The resulting\ncladograms were compared with each other and to the morphological\ncladogram for congruence. Data from all three sources strongly support\nthe monophyly of the genus, and the monophyly of the subgenera Esox\n(i.e., pikes) and Kenoza (i.e., pickerels). Our data support the\nsister-group relationship between Esox reicherti and Esox lucius (the\nAmur and Northern Pike, respectively). Incongruent results between the\nmorphological and RAG1 data and the cytb data, with respect to pickerel\ninterrelationships, suggest hybridization and introgression among\npickerel species. Additional research is necessary to explore these\nresults further. This study represents the first study to integrate both\nmorphological and molecular data into a phylogenetic analysis of Esox.\nIt aims to provide a better understanding of esocid evolution and lay\nthe foundation for the interpretation of fossil material assigned to\nEsox. It also provides preliminary genetic evidence of hybridization\namong the pickerels.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1+","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Salmoniformes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53785.phy"}]}
