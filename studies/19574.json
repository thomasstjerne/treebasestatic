Peniophorella aspersa was\ncollected in Taiwan and mainland China, and characterized by minutely\nwarted hymenial surface, well-developed subiculum, rare stephanocysts\nand cylindrical-suballantoid spores. Peniophorella crystallifera\ncollected in mainland China, Taiwan and Japan, is distinguished by\nsparsely grandinioid hymenial surface, immersed heavily encrusted\ncystidia, stephanocysts and ellipsoid-subcylindrical spores. The\ncharacteristic features of P. reticulata, found in Taiwan, are minutely\nporulose, odontioid basidiomata, provided with peg-like groups of\nhyphae, stellate crystalline incrustations on hyphal ends and\noblong-ellipsoid spores. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic\nreconstructions based on ITS and 28S sequences demonstrated that P.\naspersa and P. reticulata belong to the same group of species, and the\nall three species are most closely related to P. praetermissa and P.\nrude.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peniophorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132021.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peniophorella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132022.phy"}]}
