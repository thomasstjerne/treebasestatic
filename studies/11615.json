A survey of material from\ndiseased P. angolensis trees in South Africa yielded isolates of the\nBotryosphaeriaceae, an important fungal family known to cause a number\nof tree diseases. The aim of this study was to identify these\nBotryosphaeriaceae and to determine their pathogenicity to P. angolensis\nwith branch inoculations. Seven species of the Botryosphaeriaceae were\nidentified based on a combination of morphological characteristics and\nsequences from the ITS and EF-1a gene regions. Four of these represent\nundescribed taxa for which the names Pseudofusicoccum violaceum, P.\nolivaceum, Diplodia alatafructa and Fusicoccum atrovirens are provided.\nThe remaining three species collected include Lasiodiplodia theobromae,\nL. pseudotheobromae and L. crassispora. Inoculation trials on tree\nbranches showed that L. pseudotheobromae and one isolate of D.\nalatafructa differed significantly from control inoculations. The high\nlevels of virulence and common occurrence of L. pseudotheobromae suggest\nthat this species could play a role in tree dieback and death.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46903","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46903.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46901","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46901.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46902","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46902.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46904","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46904.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46905","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46905.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46906.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46907.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46908","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46908.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46909","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46909.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46910.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46911.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae associated with Pterocarpus\nangolensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46488.phy"}]}
