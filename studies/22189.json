This is surprising, given the increasing\nrate of submission of transcriptomic datasets to the international\nsequence repositories.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109727","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109727.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109728","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109728.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109729","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109729.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109726","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109726.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109736.phy"}]}
