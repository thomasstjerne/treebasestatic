Twenty-eight species sampled from all genera of the\nAmbrosiinae are used as terminal taxa. The result reveals that Iva s.l.\nis polyphyletic. In order to make the different parts of Iva s.l.\nmonophyletic, the following taxa should be recognized: Iva s. str.\ncomprising Iva section Linearbractea and Iva section Iva, Chorisiva,\nLeuciva, Oxytenia, and Cyclachaena s. str. The two genera Hymenoclea and\nXanthium are monophyletic ingroups in a paraphyletic Ambrosia.\nTherefore, both these genera might be reduced to synonyms under Ambrosia\nif further investigations using more species as terminal taxa come to\nthe same result.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A-B","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ambrosiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1663.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ambrosiinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1664.phy"}]}
