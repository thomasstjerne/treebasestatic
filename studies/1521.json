New protein sequences from five parabasalian symbionts of\ntermites (devescovinid, calonymphid and three hypermastigids) were added\nto data sets of glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),\nenolase, a- and b-tubulins, and inferred phylogenetic relationships.\nGAPDH gave significant resolutions and showed overall congruence with\nthe well-defined relationships found in the SSU rRNA-based phylogeny.\nThe stability of the GAPDH tree increased after removing fast-evolving\namino acid positions. Although several groups of taxa were commonly\nfound, the other three proteins were poorly resolved particularly in\nbranching orders of the groups. In the combined protein data and\ndetailed GAPDH analyses, two hypermastigid lineages, Trichonymphida and\nSpirotrichonymphida branched from outside of trichomonads, and\nTrichonymphida most likely located at the basal position of\nparabasalids, both of which placements have been doubted in the SSU rRNA\nanalyses. The GAPDH data overcame the problem of resolution and provided\nus a reliable framework of parabasalian phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, alpha-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, beta-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4590.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, combined data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, GAPDH","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, GAPDH-r78","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termite parabasalian symbionts, enolase","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4588.phy"}]}
