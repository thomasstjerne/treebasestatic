Apothecia of P. sydowianum-like funugs were found\nfrom Q. cripula leaves as a result of field survey. A detailed\nmorphological examination elucidated the difference between P.\nsydowianum and this fungus, including the remarkable pigmentation prior\nto the ascospore germination. Sequences obtained from isolates from Q.\ncrispula leaves, ascosporous isolates from the apothecia, and isolates\nof P. sydowianum preserved in CBS was compared. The ITS sequences were\nalmost identical within the Japanese isolates and European isolates,\nrespectively, but differed up to 10% between the groups, supporting that\nthey belong to different species. A new species P. sydowianum is\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70276.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70277.phy"}]}
