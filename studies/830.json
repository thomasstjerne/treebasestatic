This phylogeny was derived by\ncombining 105 estimates of bat phylogenetic relationships published\nsince 1970 using the supertree construction technique of Matrix\nRepresentation with Parsimony (MRP). Despite the explosive growth in the\nnumber of phylogenetic studies of bats since 1990, phylogenetic\nrelationships in the order have been studied non-randomly. For example,\nover one third of all bat systematic studies to date have focussed on\nrelationships within Phyllostomidae, whereas relationships within clades\nsuch as Kerivoulinae and Murinae have never been studied using cladistic\nmethods. Resolution in the supertree similarly differs among clades:\noverall resolution is poor (46.4% of a fully bifuricating solution) but\nreaches 100% in some groups (e.g., relationships within Mormoopidae).\nThe supertree analysis does not support a recent proposal that\nMicrochiroptera is paraphyletic with respect to Megachiroptera as the\nmajority of source topologies support microbat monophyly. While it is\nnot a substitute for comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of primary\nmolecular and morphological data, the bat supertree provides a useful\ntool for future phylogenetic comparative and macroevolutionary studies.\nAdditionally, it identifies clades that have been little studied,\nhighlights groups within which relationships are controversial, and like\nall phylogenetic studies, provides preliminary hypotheses that can form\nstarting points for future phylogenetic studies of bats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Natalidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3976.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 and 15.1","ntax":"209","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mormoopidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figs. 4.1 to 4.5","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropodidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3969.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4.6","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pteropus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3970.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Emballonuridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3971.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nycteridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3972.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Megadermatidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3973.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhinolophidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3974.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hipposideridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3975.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"141","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllostomidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3978.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Molossidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3979.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15.2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Miniopterinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15.3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kerivoulinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3981.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15.4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Murinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3982.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15.14","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myotis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3983.phy"}]}
