Previous molecular phylogenetic studies showed Amomum to be\nparaphyletic but limited sampling and absence of the data of the type\nspecies Amomum subulatum made it impossible to resolve the paraphyly and\nmake nomenclatural changes. Here Amomum is further investigated in a\nmulti-marker phylogenetic framework using matK and nrITS including\nmultiple accessions of the type species, the genus Elettaria and\nadditional accessions of Amomum, Alpinia, Elettariopsis, Geocharis,\nGeostachys and Hornstedtia. Amomum is shown to consist of nine clades\nand Alpinia of six. The genera Elettaria, Elettariopsis, Plagiostachys,\nand species in Hornstedtia are nested within these clades. Morphological\nstudies of species previously subsumed in Amomum support recognition of\nnew genera that correspond to well-delimited clades in the phylogenetic\nframework presented here. Recircumscription of the paraphyletic genus\nAmomum facilitates identification and creates nomenclatural stability.\nThree genera, Conamomum, Meistera and Wurfbainia, are resurrected, and\nthree new genera Epiamomum, Lanxangia and Sundamomum are described,\ntogether with a key to the genera and a nomenclatural synopsis placing\n381 specific names (incl. all synonyms) into the new generic framework.\nOf these 131 represent new combinations and two are replacement names.\nType species of Geocharis and Geostachys are designated. Further studies\nand specific sampling will be needed to resolve other branches of\nAlpinioideae containing other polyphyletic genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"170","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106652","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106652.phy"}]}
