Sequences\nof ITS and LSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied samples were generated,\nand phylogenetic analyses were performed using maximum likelihood,\nmaximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods. Steccherinum hirsutum\nis characterized by an annual growth habit, stipitate basidiocarps with\nscarlet to red, odontioid hymenial surface, a dimitic hyphal system with\nclamped generative hyphae negative in Melzers reaction, and\nacyanophilous basidiospores measuring 2.73.7 ×1.62.7 µm. Steccherinum\nyunnanense is distinguished by resupinate basidiomata with odontioid\nhymenial surface, a dimitic hyphal system with clamped generative\nhyphae, strongly encrusted cystidia and ellipsoid, hyaline, thin-walled,\nsmooth basidiospores (3.34.7 × 2.23.3 µm). The phylogenetic analyses\nbased on the ITS dataset comfirmed that two new species nest in\nSteccherinum, in the residual polyporoid clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
