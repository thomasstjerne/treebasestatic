In this study, we use both morphological and sequencing\ndata to describe a new Lophodermium species associated with haploxylon\npines from the Pacific Northwest. This new species resembled the\nmorphology of L. nitens, another commonly occurring species from the\nsame geographic regions and host species. They both present dark\nsubcuticular ascocarps without lips. However, the upper walls of their\nascocarps are different, as the new species forms an inward v-shape\nfolding, not present in L. nitens. Phylogenies using nuc rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer barcodes (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS), partial D1-D2\ndomains of nuc rDNA 28S and partial sequences of the nuc actin gene\nconfirmed that this species represents a unique lineage not closely\nrelated to L. nitens. We discuss the current state of the phylogeny in\nlight of all currently available sequences from pine-associated\nLophodermium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophoderium ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112460.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophoderium ITS LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112461.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium act","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112462.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium act","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112463.phy"}]}
