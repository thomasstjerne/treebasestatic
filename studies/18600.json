Nowadays it has about\n115 species, distributed in the Neotropics, Africa, Madagascar, and\nIndia. We analyzed the relationships among 81 species of Anemiaceae,\nbased on four cpDNA regions, rbcL, rps4-trnS, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF.\nThis sampling corresponds to approximately 70% of the family diversity,\nincludes taxa from the main biogeographic areas, and represents all of\nthe genera, subgenera and sections traditionally recognized in the\nfamily. Our results support the monophyly of Anemiaceae, and the\nrecognition of a single genus, Anemia, which can be further subdivided\nin three subgenera: subg. Anemia, Mohria and subg. Anemiorrhiza. In\ngeneral, most of the sections that are recognized in Anemia are\nsupported as natural groups, but some of them will need to have their\ncircumscriptions altered in order to preserve monophyly. We also\nexplored the evolution of morphological characters by optimizing them on\nthe phylogenetic tree. Our results show that characters that have been\ntraditionally used in the taxonomy of both extant and ancient groups,\nsuch as leaf dimorphism, and perispore morphology, are homoplastic\nwithin Anemiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayes","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anemiaceae rbcL, rps4-trnS, ting-trnR, trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94711.phy"}]}
