In this work, taxonomic and\nphylogenetic studies on Amauroderma s. lat. species within\nGanodermataceae were carried out by morphological even ultrastructual\nobservations, and molecular phylogenetic analyses of multiple loci (ITS,\nnLSU, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1α and βtubulin). One new genus and six new species\nare proposed, fourteen related species are described and illustrated.\nThree keys to Amauroderma s. str., Foraminispora, Sanguinoderma are\nprovided respectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114637","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114637.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114638","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114638.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114636","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114636.phy"}]}
