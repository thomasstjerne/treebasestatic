The specimen exhibits a\nunique suite of characters in the dentition, maxilla, and dentary. A\nphylogenetic analysis recovers Albalophosaurus as a basal member of\nCeratopsia: however, this placement is weakly supported and no\nunambiguous ceratopsian synapomorphies can be identified in the\nmaterial. This new taxon should, therefore, be regarded as Cerapoda\nincertae sedis until further material is discovered. Nevertheless,\nAlbalophosaurus offers additional information on the diversity of east\nAsian dinosaur faunas during the Early Cretaceous and represents only\nthe third valid dinosaur taxon to be described from Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithischia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55934.phy"}]}
