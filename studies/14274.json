Extensive macro- and microscopical\ndescriptions and illustrations of the main anatomical features are\nprovided. Similarities with other sequestrate Russulales and their\nphylogenetic relationships are discussed. The placement of the species\nwithin Lactarius and its subgenera is confirmed by a molecular phylogeny\nbased on ITS, LSU and rpb2 markers. A species key of the new taxa,\nincluding five other known angiocarpous species from South East Asia\nreported to exude milk, is given. The occurrence of angiocarpous fungi\nin tropical areas is considered underestimated and driving evolutionary\nforces towards gasteromycetization are probably more diverse than\ngenerally assumed. The discovery of a large diversity of angiocarpous\nmilkcaps on a rather local tropical scale was unexpected, and especially\nthe fact that in Sri Lanka more angiocarpous than agaricoid Lactarius\nspecies are known now.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63712","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63712.phy"}]}
