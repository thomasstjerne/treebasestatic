Combined phylogenetic analysis\nof ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT and TUB2 sequence data demonstrate that\nColletotrichum artocarpicola is a distinct species within the\ngloeosporioides species complex. The new species is illustrated and\ncompared with related taxa, and evidence of its pathogenicity is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
