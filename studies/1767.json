The nucleotide\nsequence codes for a 229 amino acid peptide. The COII sequence is A+T\nrich (74.1%), with up to 12.3% nucleotide and 8.4% amino acid divergence\namong the five taxa. Of the 688 nucleotides encoding for the gene, 135\nnucleotide sites (19.6%) are variable, and 55 (8.0%) are\nphylogenetically informative. A phylogenetic analysis using three\ncalliphorids as the outgroup taxa, indicates that the two haematophagus\nspecies, horn fly and stable fly, form a sister group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscoids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscoids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2697.phy"}]}
