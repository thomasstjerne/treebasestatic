Since hybridization between N. mexicana and N.\nodorata is possible, the status of populations assigned to either\nspecies based on morphological characters was evaluated by using a more\ndistant outgroup, subgenus Brachyceras. The ITS region revealed N.\nodorata to be monophyletic and sister to N. mexicana. Within N. odorata,\npolymorphic sites were detected, indicating possible hybridization\nbetween the subspecies. The geographic location of these hybrids\nsuggests a possible hybrid zone. Overall, molecular evidence supports\nthe segregation of subsp. odorata and subsp. tuberosa, with limited gene\nflow between the subspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Temperate Nymphaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1947.phy"}]}
