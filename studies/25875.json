Here, we propose a\nlineage-based classification for the genus, including the description of\ntwo new series (ser. Cristatae , ser. Rinoreifoliae) and a new subseries\nin ser. Turnera (subser. Macronectariae). A list of 130 species (and 42\ninfraspecific taxa) currently accepted and a key to the series and\nsubseries of Turnera are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Turnera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122484.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Turnera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122483.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Turnera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122482.phy"}]}
