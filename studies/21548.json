The new species is presently known only\nfrom one ridge in the Cordillera Azul, and therefore we recommend\nfurther fieldwork to determine its full distribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrmoderus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106846.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrmoderus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106847.phy"}]}
