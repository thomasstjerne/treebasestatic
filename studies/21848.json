Eighty-eight\ncollections were examined, along with twenty European specimens as\nstandards of species described from Europe but occurring on both\ncontinents. The combination of morphological and molecular evidence\nrevealed ten Ganoderma species occurring in the USA: G. acontextum sp.\nnov., G. applanatum, G.brownii, G. carnosum, G. curtisii, G. lobatum, G.\nmartinicense, G. oregonense, G. sessile, G. tsugae and G. zonatum. G.\nadspersum, G. lucidum and G. resinaceum could not be identified in the\nUSA, we treat G. oregonense as synonyms of G. carnosum. A new species G.\nacontextum sp. nov. is described based on both morphological characters\nand DNA sequence data. The structure of the genus Ganoderma in the USA\nis discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108040.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108039.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108041.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108042","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108042.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108043.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108044.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108045.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108046","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108046.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108047","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108047.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108048","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108048.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108049","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108049.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108050","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108050.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108051","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108051.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108052","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108052.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108053","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108053.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108054","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108054.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108055.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108056","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108056.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108057","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108057.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108059","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108059.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108060","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108060.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108061","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108061.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108062.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108063.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108064.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108065.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108066.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108067","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108067.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1260","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108068.phy"}]}
