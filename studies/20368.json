These enzymes are widely\ndistributed among plants and their presence has also been confirmed in\nseveral bacterial species. Recently, we reported for the first time in\nsilico evidence of RIP encoding genes in metazoans, in two closely\nrelated species of insects: Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus.\nHere, we have experimentally confirmed the presence of these genes in\nmosquitoes and attempted to unveil their evolutionary history. A\ndetailed study was conducted, including evaluation of taxonomic\ndistribution, phylogenetic inferences and microsynteny analyses,\nindicating that mosquito RIP genes derived from a single Horizontal Gene\nTransfer (HGT) event, probably from a cyanobacterial donor species.\nMoreover, evolutionary analyses show that, after the HGT event, these\ngenes evolved under purifying selection, strongly suggesting they play\nfunctional roles in these organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101145.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101146.phy"}]}
