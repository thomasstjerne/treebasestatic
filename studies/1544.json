Fruiting structures of the fungus could be\ndistinguished from those of C. cubensis by their distinctly orange\nconidiomatal necks. This fungus was also found on several plant species\nnative to Colombia including Tibouchina urvilleana, T. lepidota and\nMiconia theaezans (Melastomataceae, Myrtales). Morphological comparisons\nas well as those based on sequences of the ITS1/ITS2 region of the\nribosomal DNA repeat and the Beta-tubulin gene, were used to\ncharacterize this fungus. Its pathogenicity was also assessed on various\nplants from which it has been collected, either in field or greenhouse\ntrials. Phylogenetic analyses showed that isolates reside in a clade\ndistinct from the four clades accommodating Chrysoporthe, Cryphonectria,\nEndothia and Rostraureum. Members of this clade are distinguished by the\npresence of orange conidiomatal necks with black bases, and a unique\ninternal stromatal structure. No teleomorph has been found for this\nfungus, for which we have provided the name Aurapex penicillata gen. sp.\nnov. A. penicillata produced only small lesions after inoculation on\nyoung T. urvilleana, M. theaezans and E. grandis trees, and appears not\nto be a serious pathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aurapex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2436.phy"}]}
