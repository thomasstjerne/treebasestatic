Partial nucleotide sequences\nof four loci (ITS, tef1-α, ACT and RPB2) of these three species were\ngenerated for a phylogenetic analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113235","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113235.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
