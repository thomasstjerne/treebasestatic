Of 1819 nucleotide positions sequenced, 17 were\nphylogenetically informative. With Lythrum (Lythraceae) as the outgroup,\none most parsimonious cladogram was derived (length - 28; consistency\nindex - 0.75) using computer-assisted phylogeny inference software. The\ncladogram supported Ludwigia as the sister group to Onagraceae and\nprovided strong evidence for the monophyly of Oenothera-Epilobium and\nCircaea-Fuchsia. The placements of Hauya and Lopezia were not well\nsupported by the data as indicated by examining trees which were one\nstep longer than the most parsimonious tree.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1540.phy"}]}
