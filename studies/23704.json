Recent progress in ITS-sequencing within the\ngenus, coupled with an extensive database of parametrically described\ncollections, now allows comparisons between species and their\ndistributions. Here we report 16 species of Hebeloma from the Rocky\nMountain alpine zone from some of the lowest latitudes (latitude 3645 N)\nand highest elevations (30004000 m) for arctic-alpine fungi in the\nnorthern hemisphere. Twelve of these species have been reported from\narcticalpine habitats in Europe and Greenland and are now molecularly\nconfirmed from the Middle and Southern Rockies, greatly expanding their\ndistribution. These are: Hebeloma alpinum, H. aurantioumbrinum, H.\ndunense, H. hiemale, H. marginatulum, H. mesophaeum, H. nigellum, H.\noreophilum, H. subconcolor, H. spetsbergense, H. vaccinum, and H.\nvelutipes. Hebeloma hygrophilum is known from subalpine habitats in\nEurope, but was never recorded in arctic-alpine ecology. Three species\nrecorded from the Rockies, but as yet not reported from Europe, are H.\nalpinicola, H. avellaneum, and H. excedens. The last two have never\npreviously been reported from an arctic-alpine habitat. For all three of\nthese species, the holotypes have been studied morphologically and\nmolecularly, and have been incorporated into the analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115382.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115381.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115385.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115378.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115380","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115380.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115379.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115384.phy"}]}
