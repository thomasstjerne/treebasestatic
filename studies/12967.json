Similar nutrient\nassimilation was observed between both strains and the\npullulan-producing A. pullulans NRRL 58560. All three strains weakly\nassimilated methyl-α-D-glucoside and lactose. For the exopolysaccharide\n(EPS) production, NRRL 58539 and NRRL 58543 preferred NaNO3 as the sole\nnitrogen sources. Enzyme sensitivity assays, infrared spectroscopy and\nnuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the EPSs revealed a broad\nstructural similarity to aubasidan and not to pullulan. This is the\nfirst report of an aubasidan-like β-glucan produced by A. pullulans in\nThailand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aubasidan-like β-glucan
