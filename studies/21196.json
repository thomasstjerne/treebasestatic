Conidial production of these strains\nwas induced on pine needle medium where spermatia have also been\nobserved. Pathogenicity tests confirmed their virulence on potted vines.\nDothiorella omnivora is a recently described species of the\nBotryosphaeriaceae, known to infect hazelnut, ash, walnut, and other\nwoody hosts. This is its first European record from vines exhibiting GTD\nsymptoms. The EF1-α sequences determined in this work for D. omnivora\ncan be used as additional diagnostic markers for this species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"50% maj rul","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella omnivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105489.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT+bootstrap","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella omnivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105488.phy"}]}
