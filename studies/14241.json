Average vessel diameter\nis known to scale with stem size within and across species. Vessel\ndiameter also seems to differ between clades and across environments,\nwith dryland plants having narrower, more cavitation resistant vessels.\nAs a result, it is not clear to what extent phylogenetic affinity and\nenvironment are associated with differences in the vessel diameter-stem\nsize relationship.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximum Clade Credibility","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commiphora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63518.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes Majority Rule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commiphora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63519.phy"}]}
