Although four mating systems have been recognized worldwide\nin strains identified as “Volvox africanus”, most of these strains are\nextinct. However, we previously rediscovered two types of the four\nmating systems (heterothallic, and homothallic with male and bisexual\nspheroids within a clone) from an ancient Japanese lake, Lake Biwa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130928.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130923.phy"}]}
