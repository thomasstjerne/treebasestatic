The skull lacks\nthe braincase (including the frontals) and much of the nasals, and the\npreserved portions are crushed or plastically deformed, which makes\nanatomical interpretations difficult. A preserved midline fragment of\nthe conjoined nasals suggests that it lacked a gryposaur-like ‘Roman\nnose’, but the nature of the crest, if present, is impossible to\ndetermine with certainty. A phylogenetic analysis places this specimen\nas either the sister taxon of Saurolophus or as the sister taxon to a\nclade comprising Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. There is no compelling\nmorphological evidence to support the previous assignment of LACM/CIT\n2852 to Saurolophus rather than to Edmontosaurus, and its poor\npreservation prevents positive assignment to any taxon below\nHadrosaurinae indet. Given its geographic setting and morphological\nuncertainties, it is also possible that this specimen repre- sents a\nseparate taxon, but more material is needed to clarify the identity of\nthe Moreno hadrosaurine. LACM/CIT 2852 does, however, provide evidence\nthat Maastrichtian hadrosaurines ranged west of the Sierra Nevada\nmagmatic arc, in an area where dinosaur diversity is poorly known.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 10","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55532.phy"}]}
