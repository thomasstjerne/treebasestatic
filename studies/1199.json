It has undergone considerable\nexpansion and contraction over a period of two and three quarter\ncenturies. Current generic circumscription of Polyporus has kept the\ngenus non-monophyletic. Species of Polyporus infrageneric group\nPolyporellus are closely related to some species of Lentinus. We\nintroduce data for ITS2 spacer rRNA secondary structure evolution by\nquasi-independent comparison with large subunit rRNA phylogeny, and\nsuggest a fraction of primary nuclear rDNA ITS sequence data as novel\ntaxonomic characters. A major taxonomic shift is suggested, supported by\nmolecular and morphological characters, and allowing inclusion of\nspecies with gilled hymenophores in Polyporus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_225.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2r-j","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_293.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2l","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2r-d","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1838.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2r","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1839.phy"},{"tree_label":"ignore","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"bogus tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1840.phy"}]}
