One species from Solanum tuberosum was identified\nas Alternaria blumeae and another from Physalis alkekengi was described\nas a new species. Both were determined based on morphological\ncharacteristics and multi‒gene sequence analysis of ITS, EF-1ɑ, GAPDH,\nAlt a 1 and RPB2. A. blumeae is firstly reported from S. tuberosum\nworldwide and also a new record in China. The new species were described\nand illustrated here, as Alternaria physalidis sp. nov.. It is clearly\ndistinct from the most similar species, A. zinniae in the conidial body\nlength and septate number.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116471.phy"}]}
