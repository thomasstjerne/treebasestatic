The latter is further constituted by the diploid A.\ntenuicaule (widespread), as well as other three tetraploids, A.\nkansuense (barely known), A. varians (well-known, relatively common, and\nmorphologically variable) and A. kukkonenii (rare and often\nmisidentified). These two species complexes are notorious for the\ntaxonomic difficulty, which is mainly caused by the morphological\nsimilarity of taxa within them. Here, we collected each species within\nthe two complexes, and obtained ploidy information by spore size\nmeasurement and flow cytometry investigation. Phylogenetic analyses\nusing DNA markers representing maternally inherited chloroplast and\nbiparentally inherited nuclear genomes helped to reconstruct a\nreticulate evolutionary history. The present results support previous\nhypotheses that A. sarelii is the ancestor of both A. pekinense and A.\nanogrammoides, as well as that A. tenuicaule is the common progenitor of\nA. anogrammoides, A. varians and A. kukkonenii. We also unraveled the\nautotetraploid origin of A. kansuense from A. tenuicaule for the first\ntime, and showed that A. altajense shares essentially identical genomes\nwith A. anogrammoides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"5 Imported tree pgiC BI","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree of pgiC","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117076.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 Imported tree pgiC MP","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium pekinense complex 2 pgiC MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117046.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium pekinense complex 3 rpl32-trnP ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117054.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asplenium pekinense complex 4 pgiC ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117055.phy"},{"tree_label":"1 Imported tree rpl32-trnP MP","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP tree of rpl32-trnP","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117078.phy"},{"tree_label":"6 Imported tree rpl32-trnP BI","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI tree of rpl32-trnP","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117077.phy"}]}
