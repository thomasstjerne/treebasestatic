Despite an ancient and\nrich fossil history, the tempo and mode of diversification of\nMagnoliidae remain poorly known. Using a molecular data set of 12\nmarkers and 220 species (representing >75% of genera in Magnoliidae)\nand six robust, internal fossil age constraints, we estimate divergence\ntimes and significant shifts of diversification across the clade. In\naddition, we test the sensitivity of magnoliid divergence times to the\nchoice of relaxed clock model and various maximum age constraints for\nthe angiosperms. Compared with previous work, our study tends to push\nback in time the age of the crown node of Magnoliidae (178.78-126.82\nmillion years, Myr), and of the four orders, Canellales (143.18-125.90\nMyr), Piperales (158.11-88.15 Myr), Laurales (165.62-112.05 Myr), and\nMagnoliales (164.09-114.75 Myr). Although families vary in crown ages,\nMagnoliidae appear to have diversified into most extant families by the\nend of the Cretaceous. The strongly imbalanced distribution of extant\ndiversity within Magnoliidae appears to be best explained by models of\ndiversification with 6 to 13 shifts in net diversification rates.\nSignificant increases are inferred within Piperaceae and Annonaceae,\nwhile the low species richness of Calycanthaceae, Degeneriaceae, and\nHimantandraceae appears to be the result of decreases in both speciation\nand extinction rates. This study provides a new time scale for the\nevolutionary history of an important, but underexplored, part of the\ntree of angiosperms. The ages of the main clades of Magnoliidae (above\nthe family level) are older than previously thought, and in several\nlineages, there were significant increases and decreases in net\ndiversification rates. This study is a new robust framework for future\ninvestigations of trait evolution and of factors influencing\ndiversification in this group as well as angiosperms as a whole.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85751","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85751.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85750.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85748","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85748.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85747","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85747.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85746","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85746.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85745","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85745.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85744","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85744.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85743","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85743.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85749","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85749.phy"}]}
