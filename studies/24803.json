The coexistence of diverged ITS paralogs in a\nsingle genome was previously shown by amplifying the ITS region from\nmono-ascospore isolates using specific primers designed for different\nITS paralog groups. Among those paralogs, are AT-biased ITS sequences\nwhich were hypothesized to result from repeat-induced point mutation\n(RIP). This is a process that detects and mutates repetitive DNA and\nfrequently leads to epigenetic silencing, and these mutations have been\ninterpreted as pseudogenes. Here we investigate the occurrence and\nfrequency of ITS pseudogenes in populations of O. sinensis using\nlarge-scale sampling, and discusses the implications of ITS pseudogenes\nfor fungal phylogenetic and evolutionary studies. Our results\ndemonstrate a wide distribution of ITS pseudogenes amongst different\ngeographic populations, and indicate how ITS pseudogenes can contribute\nto the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"258","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiocordyceps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126760.phy"}]}
