Hypoxylon larissae is characterized by effused-pulvinate\nstromata, Orange (7) and Luteous (12) pigments extracted in 10% KOH and\nlight brown to dark brown ascospores with straight germ slit. It is\nphylogenetically and morphologically closely related to H. fenderi.\nHypoxylon jianfengense is distinguished by tubular to long tubular\nperithecia, Dark Green (21), Isabelline (65) and Dull Green (70)\npigments extracted in 10% KOH and conspicuous coil-like perispore\nornamentation. Hypoxylon jianfengense clustered with H. invadens and H.\ntrugodes in a well-supported clade. Phylogenetic analyses of multi-gene\nsequences (ITS-LSU-RPB2-TUB2) support the recognition of the taxa as\ndistinct.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134791.phy"}]}
