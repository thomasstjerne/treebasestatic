Although in many\nstudies Peronospora farinosa is most commonly regarded as the causal\nagent of the disease, identification and classification of the pathogen\nremain still uncertain due to its taxonomic confusion. Thirty six\nisolates from different geographic origins including Argentina, Bolivia,\nDenmark, Ecuador, and Peru, were morphologically and molecularly\ncompared with Peronospora species from other Chenopodium species. The\nmorphology of three herbarium specimens was similar to that of P.\nvariabilis, which originated from C. album, characterized by flexuous to\ncurved ultimate branchlets and pedicellated conidia. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on ITS rDNA sequences also placed the quinoa pathogen\nwithin the same clade as P. variabilis. Within the ITS rDNA sequences of\nthe quinoa pathogens, two base substitutions were found, which separated\nthe majority of the Danish isolates from isolates from South America,\nbut no sequence difference was found among the isolates from different\ncultivars of quinoa. The present results indicate that the pathogen\nresponsible for the quinoa downy mildew is identical to Peronospora\nvariabilis and that it should not be lumped with P. farinosa as claimed\npreviously by most studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Downy Mildew on Quinoa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6285.phy"}]}
