For phylogenetic\nanalysis, sequences of the nuc rDNA ITS1‐5.8S‐ITS2 (ITS barcode), D1D2\ndomains of the nuc 28S rDNA (28S), nuc 18S rDNA (18S) and the\nTranslation elongation factor alpha (TEF1α) regions were amplified.\nIntercompatibility tests were performed and subsequent development of\nclamp connections and basidia were documented. Evidence for life history\nstrategies and association with diseased leaves including rust-infected\nleaves, are evaluated across the genus. Finally, we document the first\nisolate of a member of Bannoa from South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113465","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113465.phy"}]}
