The ancient Lake\nBiwa in central Japan has historically experienced substantial changes\nin the lake size, and it provides a useful system for evaluating the\nrole of lake fluctuations in the diversification of endemic fauna. Here,\nwe used genome-wide DNA analyses and reconstructed the diversification\nhistory of the endemic freshwater snails belonging to the subgenus\nBiwamelania with respect to the geological history of Lake Biwa. We\nfound that two genetically distinct snail lineages independently\ncolonized Lake Biwa and they concurrently and rapidly radiated into 15\nextant Biwamelania species. A combination of paleontological evidence\nand molecular dating technique demonstrated that the radiation of\nBiwamelania was tightly linked to the latest enlargement of the lake\nabout 0.4 million years ago and suggested that increased ecological\nopportunity associated with the lake expansion drove the rapid adaptive\nradiation. We propose that the Biwamelania snails in Lake Biwa offer a\npromising new system for understanding the association between the\ngeological history of the lake and rapid intralacustrine\ndiversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Biwamelania Maximum likelihood tree based on the\nconcatenated ddRAD loci","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114460.phy"}]}
