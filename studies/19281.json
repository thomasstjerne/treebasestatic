However, relying solely on\nmorphology led to frequent species misidentification. This was\nempirically demonstrated when specimens morphologically identified as\nPhilornis seguyi were reclassified as Philornis torquans using the\nsecond ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) as a molecular\nmarker, showing that P. seguyi actually represents a composite taxon.\nHerein, new molecular data on specimens assigned to P. torquans and P.\nseguyi from the region reported as the type-locality of P. seguyi\n(Misiones province, Argentina) was analyzed. ITS2 sequences obtained\nwere different to those from Philornis previously reported, increasing\nto three the number of documented genotypes of flies morphologically\nsimilar to P. torquans. These results strongly suggest that subcutaneous\nPhilornis spp. from southern South America could represent a complex of\nspecies (P. torquans complex).","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muscidae ITS2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95901.phy"}]}
