Three independent analyses were performed, each with a\nditferent outgroup. These outgroups were l) the antrodiaetid genus\nAliatypus Smith 1908, the putative sister group of Atypoides plus\nAntrodiaetus 2) Aliatypus gulosus Coyle 1974, the most primitive\nAliatypus species, and 3) a hypothetical ancestral taxon based on\ncharacter states found in Aliatypus and the Atypidae, the latter being\nthe putative sister group of the antrodiaetids. These three analyses\nproduced a total of eight most parsimonious trees which support the\nfollowing principal conclusions: l) Atypoides as defined by Coyle, is\nparaphyletic (Atypoides riversi 0. P.-Cambridge 1883 plus At. gertschi\nCoyle 1968 share with Antrodiaetus a common ancestor not shared with At.\nhadros Coyle 1968). 2) Antrodiaetus roretzi (L. Koch 1878) is a relict\nspecies which shares a unique common ancestor with all other\nAntrodiaetus species. 3) Coyle’s unicolor group of nine Antrodiaetus\nspecies is paraphyletic; six of these form a recently-derived clade,\n(Antrodiaetus occultus Coyle 197l (An. yesoensis [Uyemura 1942], An.\ncerberus Coyle l971, (An. montanus [Chamberlin & Ivie 1933], (An.\npugnax [Chamberlin 1917], An. hageni [Chamberlin 1917]), and the other\nthree species, An. pacificu. (Simon 1884), An. robustus (Simon 1890),\nand An. unicolor (Hentz l841), are derived from more ancestral stock. 4)\nCoyle’s lincolnianus group of three Antrodiaetus species, An.\nlincolnianus (Worley 1928), An. stygius Coyle 1971, and An. apachecus\nCoyle 1971, represents a valid clade. Our phylogeny suggests that two\nseparate vicariance events led to the evolution of the two east Asian\nmembers of this otherwise North American assemblage. Vicariance events\nthat are indicated by geological evidence and consistent with our\nphylogeny are postulated to account for the present distribution of\nNorth American species. New putative synapomorphies of Antrodiaetus and\nof Antrodiaetus plus Atypoides are proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodiaetus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodiaetus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4C","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodiaetus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1353.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodiaetus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1351.phy"}]}
