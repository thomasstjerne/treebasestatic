This species is characterized by\nsessile basidiocarps with an ungulate pileus, a black crust on the\npileus surface, pores 46/mm, a dimitic hyphal system comprising clamped\ngenerative hyphae and cyanophilous skeletal binding hyphae with or\nwithout a dextrinoid reaction, cylindrical basidiospores measuring\n5.57.5 × 23 μm, and cystidioles on the sides of tubes and near the pore\nsurface. Morphological examination of authentic specimens of other\nMelanoderma species revealed that the genus is variable in terms of the\nshape and size of cystidioles. A black crust on the pileus surface\ncomposed of palisade and highly agglutinated hyphae is a distinctive\ndiagnostic morphological feature of Melanoderma that differentiates it\nfrom allied genera. Melanoderma boninense, which is currently known from\na restricted area of the Bonin Islands, is potentially threatened by\nenvironmental reduction of the type locality due to the invasive tree\nBischofia javanica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITSMPtree2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121824.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLtreeITS","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121826.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITSMPtree3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121825.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121827.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITSMPtree1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121823.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121828.phy"}]}
