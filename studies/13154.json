In contrast to Europe and Asia, the North American\nrecord of Early Cretaceous basal iguanodonts has until recently been\nlimited largely to skulls and skeletons of Tenontosaurus tilletti.\nHerein we describe two new basal iguanodonts from the Yellow Cat Member\nof the Cedar Mountain Formation of eastern Utah, each known from a\npartial skull and skeleton. Iguanacolossus fortis gen. et sp. nov. and\nHippodraco scutodens gen. et sp. nov. are each diagnosed by a single\nautapomorphy and a unique combination of characters. Iguanacolossus and\nHippodraco add greatly to our knowledge of North American basal\niguanodonts and prompt a new comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of\nbasal iguanodont relationships. This analysis indicates that North\nAmerican Early Cretaceous basal iguanodonts are more basal than their\ncontemporaries in Europe and Asia.
