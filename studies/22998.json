As the number of Phytophthora species continues to grow,\nidentifying isolates in this genus has become increasingly challenging\neven by DNA sequencing. This study evaluated nine commonly used genetic\nmarkers against 154 formally described and 17 provisionally named\nPhytophthora species. These genetic markers were the cytochrome-c\noxidase 1 (cox1), internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), 60S\nribosomal protein L10, beta-tubulin (β-tub), elongation factor 1 alpha,\nenolase, heat shock protein 90, 28S ribosomal DNA, and tigA gene fusion\nprotein (tigA). As indicated by species distance, cox1 had the highest\ngenus-wide resolution, followed by ITS, tigA, and β-tub. Resolution of\nthese four markers also varied with (sub)clade. β-tub alone could\nreadily identify all species in clade 1, cox1 for clade 2, and tigA for\nclades 7 and 8. Two or more genetic markers were required to identify\nspecies in other clades. For PCR consistency, ITS (99% PCR success rate)\nand β-tub (96%) were easier to amplify than cox1 (75%) and tigA (71%).\nAccordingly, it is recommended to take a two-step approach: classifying\nunknown Phytophthora isolates to clade by ITS sequences, as this marker\nis easy to amplify and its signature sequences are readily available,\nthen identifying to species by one or more of the most informative\nmarkers for the respective (sub)clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TigA ML","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114202.phy"},{"tree_label":"TigA NJ","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114201.phy"},{"tree_label":"btub ML","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114200.phy"},{"tree_label":"btub NJ","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114199.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114198.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS NJ","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114197.phy"},{"tree_label":"cox1 ML","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114196.phy"},{"tree_label":"cox1 NJ","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concat ML","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114194.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concat NJ","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114193.phy"}]}
