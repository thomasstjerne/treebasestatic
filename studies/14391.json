Single-gene trees were\nestimated for all three markers, using coalescence analysis and they\nwere in many parts incongruent with each other. Only one of the clusters\nwas supported by all trees;, it was also morphologically differentiated\nfrom the other clusters by the shape of its modified penial chaetae.\nThis group consists of two specimens from the Crotot Cave in\nsouth-eastern France, and morphologically they fit a previously\ndescribed but invalid variety, ‘pigueti’, which is here described as a\nnew species, Rhyacodrilus pigueti Achurra & Martinsson sp. n. The\nstudy highlights the fact that a single data source (e.g., COI-barcodes)\nseldom provides a sufficient basis for taxonomical decisions such as\nspecies delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhyacodrilus falciformis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67531.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhyacodrilus falciformis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67532.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhyacodrilus falciformis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64531.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhyacodrilus falciformis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64534.phy"}]}
