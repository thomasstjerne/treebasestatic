These are small toads that\nlack parotoid glands and digital webbing, and have partially fused\nepicoracoid cartilages. The clade formed by these species is named as a\nnew, phylogenetically defined, taxon within Bufonidae: Truebella. The\nphylogenetic status of the supraspecific taxa within Bufonidae is\nreviewed; of 33 genera, only 12 have evidence of monophyly. Therefore, a\npurely phylogenetic taxonomy of Bufonidae would require elimination or\nredefinition of many taxon names. Although we do not take such action at\nthis time, we see use of phylogenetic definitions of taxon names as an\nimportant goal for the future if the rich diversity of bufonids is to be\nmore thoroughly understood. Key words: Anura; Bufonidae; Peru;\nPhylogenetic Options; Truebella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bufonid taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5504.phy"}]}
