Evidence for the new species is\nprovided by morphological and phylogenetic analyses using ITS, EF1-Î± and\nRPB1 sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses show that F. xiangyunensis\nclustered in one clade with those species belong to F. solani species\ncomplex (FSSC) and is grouped together with F. witzenhausenense. In\nmorphology, this species is different from F. witzenhausenense in host\noccurrence, conidia and chlamydospores. Furthermore, the nematicidal\nactivity shows that its microconidia cause the infection and dead of\nnematodes in both sterile water and solid medium. Therefore, we\nintroduce F. xiangyunensis as a novel species with a description and its\nnematicidal activity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118665.phy"}]}
