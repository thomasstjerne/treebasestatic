Particularly, in\nant Vollenhovia emeryi, females and males are asexually produced, while\nsterile workers were sexually produced. In general, the asexual\nreproduction mode is likely to induce some disadvantages in genetic\nstructures of population. Therefore, in some cases of organism with\nasexual reproduction modes, the systems have evolved to compensate for\nthe disadvantages. However, there are few studies about functions to\ncompensate the disadvantages in clonal ants. In this study, we found the\nproduction of two types of queen with functional (F-queens) and no\nfunctional wings (NF-queens) in S-queen colonies of V. emeryi. F-queens\nwere frequently produced in mature colonies. Genotype analyses revealed\nall F-queens were produced sexually while NF-queens were almost produced\nasexually. By the characteristics of reproductive behavior in two queen\ntypes, we proposed two hypotheses for the function of F-queen:\nadaptation to long-dispersal and compensation for the demerits with\nasexual reproduction mode.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vollenhovia emeryi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48150.phy"}]}
