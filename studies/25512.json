Multiclavula vernalis was scattered on Andosols in subalpine\nhabitats in Japan, and its lichenized thallus was amorphous and composed\nof spherical algal cells surrounded by fungal hyphae. The photobiont\nseems to be a green alga and contained many vesicles thought to be\nlipids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Multiclavula Mv ITS v191213","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128198.phy"}]}
