The most prominent and largest order is the\nMucorales Fries 1832 comprising saprotrophic and facultatively parasitic\nspecies. The traditional family system of the Mucorales deviates\nsubstantially from molecular phylogenies. Multi-gene genealogies based\non Bayesian inference analyses of the exonic genes for actin (act),\nbeta-tubulin (btub) and translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef), the\nnuclear genes for the small (18S) and large (28S) subunit ribosomal RNA\n(comprising 811, 1168, 1112 871, 402 characters, respectively) of\ntwenty-seven genera of the Mucorales shows that the traditional family\nstructure is highly unnatural at the level of groups with monophyletic\norigin. Four families can be considered to be monophyletic; the\nUmbelopsidaceae, the Phycomycetaceae, the Absidiaceae and the\nChoanephoraceae including Gilbertella. The establishment of a natural\nsystem suggests Spinellus as the closest phylogenetic relative to\nPhycomyces, which converts the former monogeneric family Phycomycetaceae\nbeing bigeneric. The Mucoraceae and the Thamnidiacaeae, both\nrepresenting the largest families, are polyphyletic and therefore highly\nunnatural at the phylogenetic level. Special emphasis was given to the\ndetermination of micromorphological and ultrastructural apomorphies\nderived by light and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore,\nphylogenetic reconstructions based on a combined profile distance\nanalysis of small and large subunit rDNA (1431 and 387 characters,\nrespectively) of seventy-two taxa suggest a close phylogenetic\nrelationship between the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. The\nMortierellales Cavalier-Smith 1998, which has been recently classified\nto the Mucormycotina, appear as the basal group of the Dikarya.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MB","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5143.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 ML","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 NJ","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PD","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5146.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MB","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5147.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 NJ","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5148.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 PD","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5149.phy"}]}
