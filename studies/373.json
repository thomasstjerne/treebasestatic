However, skeletal, muscular and\nvisceral character sets analysed separately or in pairs give four groups\nof nonconcordant tree topologies. Based on the cladogram derived from\nthe total evidence, two families are erected to prevent the existing\nfamily Uropeltidae from becoming paraphyletic: Anomochilidae, for the\nMalaysian and Indonesian genus Anomochilus, and Cylindrophiidae, for the\nSri Lankan, Southeast Asian and Indonesian genus Cylintrophis and the\nUpper Eocene fossil Eoanilius.
