We used Bayesian\ninference and maximum likelihood methods to infer phylogenetic\nrelationships. Our results indicate that the genera Ravinia and\nChaetoravinia, previously synonymised into the genus Ravinia (sensu\nlato) are each likely to be monophyletic (posterior probability 1;\nbootstrap support 85%). We found highly supported paraphyletic\nrelationships among species of Ravinia, with relatively deep splits in\nthe phylogeny. This conflict between the morphological species\ndefinitions and the mtDNA phylogeny could be indicative of the presence\nof cryptic species in Ravinia anxia (Walker, 1849), Ravinia floridensis\n(Aldrich, 1916), Ravinia lherminieri (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), and\nRavinia querula (Walker, 1849).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP Best MLT","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ravinia COI COII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88331.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ravinia COI COII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88332.phy"}]}
