Distinguishing morphological characters for the genus\nKarenia included a smooth theca and a linear apical groove. The new\nspecies can be distinguished on the basis of morphological characters of\nvegetative cells that include; the location and shape of the nucleus,\nthe relative excavation of the hypotheca, the characteristics of apical\nand sulcal groove extensions on the epitheca, the cellular shape, size\nand symmetry, degree of dorsoventral compression, and presence of an\napical protrusion or carina. Species with pronounced dorso-ventral\ncompression swim in a distinctive fluttering motion. An\ninter-cingulartubular structure (ICTS) traversing the proximal and\ndistal ends of the cingulum is common to the species of Karenia,\nKarlodinium micrum (Leadbeater & Dodge) J. Larsen, Gymnodinium\npulchellum J. Larsen and Gyrodinium corsicum Paulmier. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses of rDNA sequence alignments shows that the new\nspecies are phylogenetically distinct but closely related to K.\nmikimotoi and K. brevis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Karenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1256.phy"}]}
