There has been only one\nearlier report of a morel population, presumably mycorrhizal, persisting\nfor several months at a single site from Israel. The present study\ndescribes a new pioneer type that fruited in northern Israel from early\nNovember to late May (winter and spring). The new ecotype, Morchella\nrufobrunnea (MS2-IL), was identified using the sequence of the nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer and is reported for the first time\nout of the American Continent. Its population size was monitored from\n2001 to 2006 and correlated with concurrently collected rainfall and\ntemperature data. This constitutes the first report of a sighting of M.\nrufobrunnea in Israel and the second report describing long season\nmorels anywhere in the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6491.phy"}]}
