Additionally, a\nphylogenetic analysis using sequences of internal transcribed spacer\nregions (ITS) of 35 further species, was accomplished through direct\ncharacter optimization. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed\ninvolving 15 indel-substitution models. Information derived from these\nanalyses contributed to clarify the relationships among South American\nrepresentatives of the genus. The Neighbor-joining clustering of AFLP\nmarkers rendered groupings that were in accordance with morphological\nidentification of the accessions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that\nITS sequences of South American taxa were not monophyletic. Likewise,\nITS sequences of both North American and Asian taxa were not\nmonophyletic. In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that the\nplacement of several taxa was highly sensitive to parameter variation,\nwhereas other taxa formed stable clades, which were associated according\nto their geographical origin. The AFLP phenogram and the consensus\ncladogram were remarkably congruent in that both demonstrate the\nexistence of a group formed by I. brasiliensis, I. theezans, I.\nintegerrima, I. brevicuspis and I. argentina, and that I. dumosa and I.\nparaguariensis were unrelated to the former group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"strict 411","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1272.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 241","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1271.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 421","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1273.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 111","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1266.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 121","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1267.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 141","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1268.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 211","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1269.phy"},{"tree_label":"single 221","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1270.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 441","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1274.phy"},{"tree_label":"single 811","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1275.phy"},{"tree_label":"single 821","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1276.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 841","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1277.phy"},{"tree_label":"single 1011","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1278.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 1021","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1279.phy"},{"tree_label":"strict 1041","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1280.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ilex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1281.phy"}]}
