Agaricus cupressophilus and A. tlaxcalensis, in the new\nsubsection Cupressorum, and A. agrinferus, A. devoniensis subsp.\nbridghamii, and A. subsubensis in subsection Hortenses, are described.\nPhylogeny reconstruction methods using ITS1+2 DNA sequences were used to\ndetermine appropriate placements of the new taxa. Collectively these new\ntaxa and phylogenetic associations represent a substantial augmentation\nand clarification of our knowledge of section Bivelares: described,\nsequenced species-level taxa in the northern hemisphere are increased\nfrom 6 to 10, a distinct subsectional lineage is revealed, and\ninfraspecific resolution within A. devoniensis is improved. An anomalous\nITS1+2 sequence is documented in one collection of A. subsubensis.\nPreliminary data on another novel member of Bivelares from France are\nalso provided. Several of these taxa are rare, highlighting\nopportunities and challenges for documenting biodiversity in this group.\nAdditional comments on related taxa treated in recent publications are\nalso provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricus section Bivelares","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_581.phy"}]}
