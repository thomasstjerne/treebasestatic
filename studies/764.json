A recent study of genetic diversity using\nuniversal-primed PCR (UP-PCR) fingerprints showed that subgroup AII of\nB. aclada was a possible hybrid species between B. byssoidea and\nsubgroup AI of B. aclada. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced a UP-PCR\nfragment (âˆ¼550 bp) from representative isolates of four Botrytis\nspecies, all causing disease on onions. A mixture of two nucleotides at\neach nucleotide position was found in all AII isolates analyzed at 23\npositions in the sequence. These isolates had 32 chromosomes, whereas\nall AI isolates had 16 chromosomes. Pair-wise comparison of the\nsequences of the four Botrytis species showed that a hybridization event\nbetween B. aclada (AI) and B. byssoidea could explain all 23 positions\nwith mixed nucleotides, supporting them as being parental ancestors to\nAII. These results indicate that at least one Botrytis pathogen has\nevolved through interspecific hybridization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botrytis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3838.phy"}]}
