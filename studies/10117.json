As with many groups of tropical\nvines, delineation of species within the genus has long been a challenge\nfor several reasons. Morphological features often change drastically\nover the life of an individual, many sterile specimens have been\ncollected, and it is difficult or impossible to collect or include an\nentire plant on an herbarium sheet. We present the first published\nphylogeny of Psiguria utilizing a combination of eight chloroplast\nintergenic spacers, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the\nnuclear ribosomal DNA repeat, and the intron of the low-copy nuclear\ngene serine/threonine phosphatase, for a total aligned length of 9,456\nbase pairs. The data support the monophyly of Psiguria, elucidate\nseveral species boundaries within the genus, and provide a phylogenetic\nframework for addressing many important questions about plant-insect\ninteractions in this model system. Additionally, a list of\nPsiguria-specific DNA barcodes is presented, which include the\nchloroplast regions: ndhC-trnV, rps16-trnQ, rpoB-trnC, ndhF-rpL32, and\npsbZ-trnM. For the first time, systematists, ecologists, and\nevolutionary biologists will have the tools to confidently identify\nspecies of Psiguria with DNA barcodes that may be useful in other genera\nof Cucurbitaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S345","ntax":"385","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S67","ntax":"246","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6700.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6354.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6235.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotropical Psiguria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6286.phy"}]}
