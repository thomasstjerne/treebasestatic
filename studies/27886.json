Whereas Facchinia is distributed in\nwestern Eurasia, Colobanthus is almost exclusively distributed in the\nSouthern Hemisphere, and Sagina is distributed in both hemispheres with\nhighest species diversity in western Eurasia. We examined 1. Whether\nSagina and Colobanthus are monophyletic sister genera, 2. Where the two\ngenera originated and how many times dispersal or migration between\nhemispheres occurred, and 3. Which colonization routes between\nhemispheres were taken. We reconstructed the phylogeny of Colobanthus\nand Sagina using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and\ntwo plastid spacer DNA sequences of altogether 158 ingroup samples of 45\nspecies. The phylogenies were used for molecular dating and for\nancestral area reconstructions. Sagina and Colobanthus were confirmed as\nmonophyletic sister genera. Biogeographical reconstruction based on ITS\nand cpDNA showed that Sagina reached the Southern Hemisphere in\nAustralasia or in Africa. For Colobanthus, ITS showed Australasia as a\nregion of entry, but cpDNA implied that the Southern Hemisphere may have\nbeen entered through America. As the crown group age of Colobanthus\nfalls within the Quaternary, and that of Sagina into the Late Pliocene,\nwhen geographical distances between suitable habitats may have been\nsmaller than today due to vegetation and sea level changes,\nstepping-stone migration is hypothesized for both genera. The extant\ndistributions and the biogeographical histories of Colobanthus and\nSagina show both similarities and dissimilarities. This illustrates that\nbiogeographical histories, even of closely related and ecologically very\nsimilar lineages, can be highly idiosyncratic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"205","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr129465","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129465.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr129470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129470.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"192","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr129464","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129464.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129467","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129467.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129468.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"203","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129466","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129466.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129469.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129471.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"193","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr134325","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134325.phy"}]}
