In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships\nof 52 fungal isolates mainly associated with chilli anthracnose\ncollected from major chilli growing regions in southern India with\nclosely related, well-characterized Colletotrichum species. MP tree\nbased on the ITS/ 5.8S rRNA, actin, cal, chs1, gapdh and tub2 gene\nsequence-data reveals that these fungal isolates constitute a\nwell-supported clade with the type strains of C. fructicola and C.\nsiamense. This is the first report of the involvement of C. fructicola\nand C. siamense in chilli anthracnose in India.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105738","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105738.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105739","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105739.phy"}]}
