The description is based\non five strains isolated as endophytes from roots of the brassicaceous\nplant Microthlaspi perfoliatum s.l., collected at different localities\nin Europe. As evidenced by phylogenetic analyses of regions of the\nribosomal DNA [the small and large subunits, and the internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS)] and the translation elongation factor 1-α,\nthe β-tubulin, and the actin genes, the new species is closely related\nto Exophiala tremulae and Exophiala equina. E. radicis differs from E.\ntremulae morphologically by the shape and size of their conidia. A\ncomparison of ITS sequences of E. radicis with GenBank records suggests\nthat the species has a wide distribution in the northern hemisphere, and\nthat it is commonly associated with living plant roots, indicating\npotential adaptations to this substrate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU_ML","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala spp. lsu","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91924.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU-ML","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91926","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91926.phy"},{"tree_label":"act_ML","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala spp. act","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91922.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF-1alpha-ML","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91927","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91927.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala spp. its","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91923.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS+TEF-1alpha+beta-tub","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala spp. multilocus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91925.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_GenBank-records","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala spp. its genbank","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91929.phy"},{"tree_label":"beta-tub-ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91928","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91928.phy"}]}
