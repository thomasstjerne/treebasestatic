Protein domain searches\nrevealed that bacteria and plant IPT proteins were to assigned to\ndifferent protein domains families in the Pfam database, namely Pfam IPT\n(IPTPfam) and Pfam IPPT (IPPTPfam) families, both are closely related in\nthe P-loop NTPase clan. To understand the origin and evolution of the\ngenes, a species matrix was assembled across the tree of life and\nintensively in plant lineages. The IPTPfam domain was only found in few\nbacteria lineages, whereas IPPTPfam is common except in Archaea and\nMycoplasma bacteria. The bacterial IPPTPfam domain miaA genes were shown\nas ancestral of eukaryotic IPPTPfam domain genes. Plant IPTs diversified\ninto class I, class II tRNA-IPTs, and Adenosine-phosphate IPTs; the\nclass I tRNA-IPTs appeared to represent direct successors of miaA genes\nwere found in all plant genomes, whereas class II tRNA-IPTs originated\nfrom eukaryotic genes, and were found in prasinophyte algae and in\neuphyllophytes. Adenosine-phosphate IPTs were only found in angiosperms.\nGene duplications resulted in gene redundancies with ubiquitous\nexpression or diversification in expression. In conclusion, it is shown\nthat IPT genes have a complex history prior to the protein family split,\nand might have experienced losses or HGTs, and gene duplications that\nare to be likely correlated with the rise in morphological complexity\ninvolved in fine tuning cytokinin production.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bacteria Pfam IPT IPPT","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isopentenyltransferase genes","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112856.phy"},{"tree_label":"IPPT large phylogeny","ntax":"215","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112788","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112860.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ tree of 103 IPPT seed","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112857","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S6","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Isopentenyltransferase genes Bacteria Pfam IPT IPPT\nPlant_Pfam_IPT_IPPT","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112915.phy"},{"tree_label":"PfamIPPT seeds","ntax":"1246","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3 IPPTIPTVirE ML","ntax":"175","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112785","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_112916.phy"}]}
