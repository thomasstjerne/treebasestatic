It has\nbeen suggested that the African-Madagascan genus Protorhus and the\nAfrican-Madagascan species of Rhus s.l. are paraphyletic, but definitive\nevidence has been lacking. We investigated a clade of Anacardiaceae\nsubfamily Anacardioideae in order to clarify evolutionary relationships\nand taxonomic rankings of the African-Madagascan members of these two\ngenera. Phylogenetic analysis of sequence data from cpDNA trnL-trnF, and\nnrDNA ETS and ITS provide strong statistical support for the 1)\nparaphyly of Protorhus; 2) monophyly of Madagascan Protorhus species; 3)\nparaphyly of Madagascan Rhus. These results support the need for new\ncircumscriptions of African Protorhus and new generic classifications\nfor the Madagascan species of these two genera. Two nomenclatural\nchanges are proposed, recognizing two former Rhus species in\nSearsia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malagasy and African Protorhus and Rhus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malagasy and African Protorhus and Rhus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2837.phy"}]}
