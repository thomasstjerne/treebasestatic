Muell is a genus of rainforest trees or\nshrubs native to New Guinea, New Britain, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and\neastern Australia. There is debate about the number of species that\nshould be recognised in the genus. Four species have been named, but\nauthors have commonly recognised only two species, and some recent\ntreatments accept just one widespread species with a broad ecological\nrange. We sequenced two nrDNA markers (ITS and ETS) and two cpDNA\nmarkers (rbcL and trnLtrnF) from samples across the range of Halfordia\nin Australia and New Caledonia. Three allopatric nrDNA groups were\nresolved: one from southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales\n(Group A); one from the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland (Group\nB); and one from the Cape York region of North Queensland, Torres Strait\nand New Caledonia (Group C). These groups were also partly\ndifferentiated by more slowly evolving cpDNA markers; the exception was\none widespread haplotype in Australia (presumed ancestral). The nrDNA\ngroups support recognition of three previously described species: H.\nleichhardtii (Group A), H. scleroxyla (Group B) and H. kendack (Group\nC). Divergences among eastern Australia populations are best explained\nby vicariance and correlate with geographic breaks documented for other\ntaxa (ranging in estimated ages from the mid-late Miocene to the\nPleistocene). The broad distribution of Group C, from Cape York to New\nCaledonia, with less genetic divergence, arguably reflects recent range\nexpansion into New Caledonia involving bird dispersal of fleshy\nfruits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"One of the MP trees: nrDNA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halfordia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97768.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict consensus: nrDNA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halfordia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97769.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict consensus: cpDNA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halfordia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97770.phy"}]}
