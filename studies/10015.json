Atradidymella is characterized\nby minute, unilocular, setose pseudothecia; brown, fusiform, 1-septate\nascospores; and a Phoma anamorph. The genus is distinguished from all\nother Pleosporalean genera with brown, fusiform ascospores on the basis\nof ascospore and pseudothecium morphology, and a highly reduced stroma\nthat is localized within a single host cell. Atradidymella muscivora is\ndistinguished by its minute pseudothecia (<115 Î¼m) and ascospores\nthat are slightly allantoid and constricted at the septum with the upper\ncell often wider than the lower. Its anamorph, Phoma muscivora sp. nov.,\nis morphologically distinguishable from P. herbarum in having smaller\nconidia. Parsimony analysis of the ITS region indicates A. muscivora has\naffinities to the Phoma-Ascochyta-Didymella clade that is sister to the\nPhaeosphaeriaceae within the Pleosporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Atradidymella muscivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6512.phy"}]}
