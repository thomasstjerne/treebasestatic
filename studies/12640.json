Simultaneously, the risk of\nincorporating ‘noisy’ data with misleading phylogenetic signal has also\nincreased, and may disproportionately influence the topology of weakly\nsupported nodes and lineages featuring rapid radiations and/or elevated\nrates of evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pinus Plastome","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52468.phy"}]}
