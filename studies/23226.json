The mycobiont was isolated from root, cultured on modified\nMelinÂ–Norkrans medium, and then inoculated onto fine roots of a Quercus\nserrata (Fagaceae) seedling. After observation of ectomycorrhiza\nformation, the Q. serrata seedling was grown in a pot. Thirty-six months\nafter ectomycorrhiza formation, basidioma formation was confirmed at the\nbottom of the pot. The morphological characteristics of the basidiomata\nmarked the isolate as an unknown species. Therefore, we described this\nfungus as a new species, Tomentella tokorozawaensis. Phylogenetic\nanalysis indicated that closely related sequences were detected from\nectomycorrhizas of trees of the Salicaceae, Pinaceae, and Fagaceae\ndistributed in East Asia, USA, central Africa, and Europe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113431","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113431.phy"}]}
