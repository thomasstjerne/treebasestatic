Phylogenetic analysis based on combined ITS, tef1-α\nand TUB loci supported its separation from other species of\nNeofusicoccum. Phylogenetically, isolates of N. illicii closely related\nto N. occulatum, N. macroclavatum, and N. algeriense, while the smaller\nconidiomata and the septate and pigmented senescent conidia can be\ndistinguishable from these three species. Phylogenetically, N. sinense\nclosely related to N. umdonicola, while the prosperous aerial mycelium,\nnumerous conidiomata and spermartia as well as the 13-septate and pale\nyellow senescent conidia differs from N. umdonicola as well as other\nreported species. Neofusicoccum mangiferae was isolated from the dieback\nsymptoms of mango in Guangdong Province.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106914.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107362.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107363.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107364.phy"}]}
