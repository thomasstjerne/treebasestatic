Based on phylogenetic comparisons using the ITS and Ã¢-tubulin\ngene regions, these species are distinct from known species. These\ndifferences were also supported by robust morphological characteristics.\nThe names, Phytophthora frigida sp. nov. and Phytophthora alticola sp.\nnov. were thus provided for these taxa, which are phylogenetically\nclosely related to P. mulitvesiculata and P. arecae, respectively.\nPhytophthora frigida is heterothallic, and differs from P.\nmultivesiculata in producing stellate to rosaceous growth patterns on\ngrowth medium, corraloid hyphae, zoosporangia with a variety of\ndistorted shapes and has the ability to grow at low temperatures.\nPhytophthora alticola can easily be distinguished from P. arecae by its\nslower growth in culture, and it is homothallic. Both Phytophthora\nfrigida and Phytophthora alticola are pathogenic to Eucalyptus dunnii.\nThey were, however, less pathogenic than P. cinnamomi, which is a\nwell-known pathogen of Eucalyptus in South Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2710.phy"}]}
