Results of numerical\nanalysis support the recognition of six new species within Carex divulsa\naggregate, which are also in accordance with by their geographic\ncircumscription. C. cypricus is endemic to Cyprus, C. enokii from the\nMediterranean Bassin, C. magacis from Spain and France mountains, C.\nnordica from Northern Europe, and C. egorovae and C. otomana from East\nEurope to Central Asia. The morphological data were coded and used in a\nphylogenetic analysis to discover the relationships among taxa. A key to\nall taxa belonging to the aggregate is included. Diagnostic characters,\nillustrations, and detailed descriptions of all the species are given.\nNotes are also presented on the habitat, distribution, phenology,\netimology, and conservation status of each taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex divulsa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3022.phy"}]}
