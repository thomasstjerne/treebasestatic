We demonstrate that the sugarcane plastome is completely\ntranscribed and we assemble the chloroplast of SP80-3280 using\ntranscriptomic data only. Phylogenomic analysis using mitogenomes allow\nclosely-related cultivars to be distinguished and supports the\ndiscrimination between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum cultum as\nmodern sugarcanes female parent. From whole chloroplast comparisons, we\ndemonstrate that modern sugarcane arose from a limited number of S.\ncultum female founders.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 64","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112128","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112128.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112129.phy"}]}
