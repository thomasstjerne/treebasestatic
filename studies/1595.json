In the USA a similar fungus causing canker\nand dieback of Juniperus spp. was referred to as Diplodia mutila\n(teleomorph: Botryosphaeria stevensii). The aim of this study was to\ncharacterise the cypress pathogen in terms of morphology and sequences\nof the ITS1/ITS2 operon, the beta-tubulin and translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the cypress\ncanker pathogen resides in a clade together with other Diplodia species.\nIt is, however, distinct from from both D. pinea and D. multila and more\nclosely related to Botryosphaeria tsugae. The distinct phylogenetic\nposition is supported by small differences in conidial morphology and it\nis, therefore, described as Diplodia cupressi sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4652.phy"}]}
