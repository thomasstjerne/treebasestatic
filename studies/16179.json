In this work, an in-depth analysis on the\nsystematic and the phylogenetic position of 21 sterile mycelia, isolated\nfrom Posidonia oceanica, was performed. The molecular (ITS and LSU\nsequences) analysis showed that several of them are putative new species\nbelonging to three orders in the Ascomycota phylum: Pleosporales,\nCapnodiales and Helotiales. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using\nBayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood approaches. Seven sterile\nmycelia belong to the genera firstly reported from marine environments.\nThe bioinformatic analysis allowed to identify five sterile mycelia at\nspecies level and nine at genus level. Some of the analyzed sterile\nmycelia could belong to new lineages of marine fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes and Leotiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76717.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrules","ntax":"159","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes and Leotiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76718.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes and Leotiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76716.phy"}]}
