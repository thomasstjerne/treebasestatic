Monophyly is well\nsupported by analyses of both nuclear and chloroplast DNA data and by\nthe presence of several unique morphological characters. Nine species of\nthe genus are distributed in the arid and montane regions of the\nsouthwestern United States and adjacent Mexico, three species occur in\ntemperate eastern South America, and three species are native to\nsouthern Africa. The genus thus exhibits both a New World amphitropical\nand a New World-African amphi-Atlantic distribution pattern. A\nbiogeographical analysis suggests two dispersals within the genus\naccount for the present distribution: one from North America to Africa\nand second from North America to South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pomaria, CPL ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_254.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pomaria, combined ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2442.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pomaria, ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2441.phy"}]}
