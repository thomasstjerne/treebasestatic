Lake Tanganyika, the oldest\nof the lakes, harbors the morphologically and genetically most diverse\nassemblage of cichlids and contains the highest number of endemic\ncichlid genera of all African lakes. Based on morphological grounds, the\nTanganyikan cichlid species have been grouped into 12 to 16 distinct\nlineages, so-called tribes. While the monophyly of most of the tribes is\nwell established, the phylogenetic relationships among the tribes remain\nlargely elusive. Here, we present a new tribal level phylogenetic\nhypothesis for the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika that is based on\nthe so far largest set of nuclear markers and a total alignment length\nof close to 18 kb. Using next-generation amplicon sequencing with the\n454 pyrosequencing technology, we compiled a dataset consisting of 42\nnuclear loci in 45 East African cichlid species, which we subjected to\nmaximum likelihood and Bayesian inference phylogenetic analyses. We\nanalyzed the entire concatenated dataset and each marker individually,\nand performed a Bayesian concordance analysis and gene tree discordance\ntests. Overall, we find strong support for a position of the\nOreochromini, Boulengerochromini, Bathybatini and Trematocarini outside\nof a clade combining the substrate spawning Lamprologini and the\nmouthbrooding tribes of the âH-lineageâ, which are both strongly\nsupported to be monophyletic. The Eretmodini are firmly placed within\nthe âH-lineageâ, as sister-group to the most species-rich tribe of\ncichlids, the Haplochromini. The phylogenetic relationships at the base\nof the âH-lineageâ received less support, which is likely due to high\nspeciation rates in the early phase of the radiation. Discordance among\ngene trees and marker sets further suggests the occurrence of past\nhybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting in the cichlid fishes of\nLake Tanganyika.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cichlids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79625.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP39+","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cichlids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79621.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79627.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cichlids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79620.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cichlids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79622.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79626.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79623","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79623.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79624","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79624.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP8","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79632","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79632.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79633","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79633.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79634","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79634.phy"}]}
