In addition, a\nphylogenetic reconstruction was performed to recover the position of\nthis species in relation to the main clades of the genus Mimosa. This\nnew species is assigned to sect. Habbasia ser. Bipinnatae and exhibits\nrelevant morphological differences with all described species of this\nseries, most notably the prostate habit, glabrous stems, and absence of\ninternal spicules. Our results indicate that this new entity is clearly\nnested in a strongly supported clade with other striated-corolla species\nof ser. Bipinnatae. Therefore, ser. Bipinnatae appears to be\nmonophyletic, and a morphologically and ecologically cohesive group\nwithin Mimosa. An updated identification key for this series is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mimosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125869.phy"}]}
