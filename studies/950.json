Talaromyces ocotl is described as a new species\nbased on morphological analyses and phylogenetic inferences made from\nITS and 28S rDNA sequence alignments. The geographic range of\nTalaromyces rotundus is extended to Mexico and its relationship to other\nTalaromyces species is investigated based on ITS sequence\nalignments.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces and Trichocomaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_856.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Talaromyces and Trichocomaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_857.phy"}]}
