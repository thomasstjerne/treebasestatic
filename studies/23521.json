The genus is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, effused-reflexed to pileate basidiocarps with pale yellowish\nbrown to yellowish brown, concentrically zonate or sulcate and\nvelutinate pileal surface, a trimitic hyphal system with clamped\ngenerative hyphae, tissues turning to dark in KOH, oblong to broadly\nellipsoid, hyaline, smooth and slightly thick-walled basidiospores.\nPhylogenetic analysis based on ITS+nLSU sequences indicated that\nCrassisporus belonged to the core polyporoid clade. The combined\nITS+nLSU+mtSSU+EF1-Î±+RPB2 sequences dataset of representative taxa in\nthe Polyporaceae demonstrated that Crassisporus grouped with Haploporus,\nbut formed a monophyletic lineage. In addition, four new species of\nCrassisporus, C. imbricatus, C. leucoporus, C. macroporus and C.\nmicrosporus are described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114797.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114798.phy"}]}
