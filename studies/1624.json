This\npaper reports the results of a phylogenetic analysis of the\nCalymperaceae, with an emphasis on the relationships of the large and\nputatively polyphyletic Syrrhopodon. Two chloroplast genes, rps4 and\ntrnL, part of the nuclear encoded gpd, and morphological characters were\nanalyzed individually and in combination. The total-evidence\nphylogenetic tree was used to construct a rank-free classification of\nthe Calymperaceae, following the guidelines of the current draft of the\nPhyloCode. The total-evidence cladistic analysis supports the monophyly\nof Calymperes and Mitthyridium, as well as the \u001aleucobryoid\u001a\nCalymperaceae, and confirms that Syrrhopodon (s.l.) is polyphyletic. In\nthe context of this phylogeny, the presence of peristome teeth and\nbordered leaves are derived features within the Calymperaceae. The\nrank-free system of classification has several advantages over the\nLinnaean system for coping with the taxonomic changes implicit in this\nphylogeny, primarily with regard to preserving the names of\nwell-supported monophyletic groups such as Mitthyridium. However, we\nquestion the utility of article 11.7 of the PhyloCode, and offer some\npractical observations regarding clade names and the use of type\nspecimens as specifiers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calymperaceae total evidence, strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_748.phy"}]}
