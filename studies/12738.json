The circumscription\nof these three new species from Cantharellus cibarius and other\nCantharellus species is supported by morphological differences and\nnuclear DNA sequence data (nLSU, ITS, and TEF1). Surprisingly, all three\nnew species were found under Quercus spp. in single small plot in Hixon\nForest in La Crosse, Wisconsin, emphasizing the need for further\nsystematics study of even common genera in North America. In addition, a\nreview of Cantharellus cibarius is presented, including a review of the\nrecent elevation of Cantharellus cibarius var. roseocanus to the species\nlevel.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55438.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52980.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52981.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep2","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55505.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep1BEST","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cantharellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55506.phy"}]}
