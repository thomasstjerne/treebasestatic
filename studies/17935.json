This\ngenus and its Australasian relative, Lepilaena, share similar floral\ncharacters yet have been treated as different genera or sections of\nAlthenia sensu lato (s.l.) due to the isolated geographic distribution\nas well as the differences in sex expression, stamen construction, and\nstigma morphology. The diagnostic characters, however, need reevaluation\nover the boundaries between the entities. Here we tested the taxonomic\ndelimitation between the entities, assessed synapomorphies for\nevolutionary lineages, and inferred biogeographic history in a\nphylogenetic framework. Our results indicated that Lepilaena was\nresolved as non-monophyletic in both plastid DNA and nuclear PhyC trees\nand Althenia was nested within it. As Althenia has nomenclatural\npriority, we propose a new delimitation to recognize Althenia s.l.,\nwhich can be diagnosed by the female flowers with 3-segmented perianths\nand male flowers with perianths. The previously used diagnostic\ncharacters are either autapomorphies or synapomorphies for small\nlineages within Althenia s.l., and evolutionary transitions to sessile\nfemale flowers and narrow leaves characterize larger clades.\nBiogeographic analyses suggested a Miocene origin of Althenia s.l. in\nAustralasia and indicated at least one inter- and one intra-specific\ninter-continental dispersal events among Australasia, Mediterranean\nEurasia, and South Africas CFR need to be hypothesized to explain the\ncurrent distribution patterns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89065","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89065.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89066","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89066.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89080.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89060","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89060.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89061","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89061.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89057","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89057.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89058","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89062.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89063.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89064.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr89059","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89059.phy"}]}
