The\nspecies is characterized by soft gelatinous, orange to dark orange,\ncerebriform basidioma when fresh, thin-walled, globose to broad\nellipsoid basidia with a basal clamp connection, globose to subglobose\nbasidiospores with obvious apiculus measuring 15.019.0 × 1417.5 µm, and\ngrowing on rotten wood of Liquidambar formosana. The phylogeny of\nTremella s. s. is constructed using methods of Maximum pasimony, Maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses based on the combined internal\ntranscribed spacer regions (ITS) and the large subunit (nLSU) dataset.\nThe results indicate that T. zhejiangensis forms a strongly supported\nlineage from other species. The illustrated description of the new\nspecies is provided and their related species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129736.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129737","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129737.phy"}]}
