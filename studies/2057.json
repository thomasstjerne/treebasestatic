Determining the evolutionary\nhistory and geographic distribution of these mitochondrial clades can\nelucidate the evolutionary history of the lice as well as their human\nhosts. Previous data suggest that lice belonging to mitochondrial Clade\nB may have originated in North America or Asia; however, geographic\nsampling and sample sizes have been limited. With newly collected lice,\nwe calculate the relative frequency, geographic distribution, and\ngenetic diversity of louse mitochondrial clades to determine the\ngeographic origin of lice belonging to Clade B. In agreement with\nprevious studies, genetic diversity data support a North American origin\nof Clade B lice. It is likely that lice belonging to this mitochondrial\nclade migrated to other geographic localities, e.g., Europe and\nAustralia, recently, and, if not already present, may disperse further\nto occupy all geographic regions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"197","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pediculus mitochondrial clades","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5190.phy"}]}
