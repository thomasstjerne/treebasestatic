This relationship\nwas supported through results of UPGMA analysis of 35 morphological\ncharacters and phylogenetic analysis of combined morphological and nrDNA\nITS sequence data. The latter analysis suggests that Ormosolenia and P.\nnebrodense are monophyletic sister groups, although with weak branch\nsupport. Given its unusual life cycle, distinct suffruticose, evergreen\nand dwarf habit, peculiar fruit anatomy, and possible isolated position\nin the phylogenetic tree, we recognize P. nebrodense as distinct from\nOrmosolenia and treat it as the new monotypic genus Siculosciadium,\nnamely S. nebrodense (Guss.)
