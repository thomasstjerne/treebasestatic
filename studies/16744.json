New geographical records\nand distribution maps are provided for all species, with illustrations\nand reviewed diagnosis for the genus and the four previously known\nspecies (O. punctatum Nicolet, O saccatum (Tullgren), O. longiventre\n(Nicolet) and O. itambezinho Ramírez). The phylogenetic analysis using\ncladistic methods is based on 264 previously defined characters plus one\ncharacter that arises from this study. The three new species are closely\nrelated with Oxysoma longiventre, and this four species compose what we\ndefine as the Oxysoma longiventre species group. The phylogenetic\nanalysis did not retrieve the monophyly of Oxysoma, which should be\nreevaluated together with the genus Tasata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oxysoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79937.phy"}]}
