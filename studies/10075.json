However, the reasons why levels of\ndiversity and endemism are so high remain obscure. Here, we\nreconstructed phylogenetic relationships among species in the genus\nProtea, which has its center of species richness and endemism in the\nCape, but also extends through tropical Africa as far as Eritrea and\nAngola. Contrary to previous views, the Cape is identified as the\nancestral area for the radiation of the extant lineages: most species in\nsub-tropical and tropical Africa are derived from a single invasion of\nthe region. Moreover, diversification rates have been similar within and\noutside the Cape region. Migration out of the Cape has opened up vast\nareas to those lineages, but they have not diversified as extensively at\nnarrow spatial scales as lineages in the Cape. Therefore, higher net\nrates of diversification do not explain the high diversity and endemism\nof Protea in the Cape. Instead, understanding why the Cape is so diverse\nrequires an explanation for how Cape species are able to diverge and\npersist at such small spatial scales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Protea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6265.phy"}]}
