Based on this data, the\nauthors concluded that the application of more than one phylogenetic\nmethod is redundant. In the work presented here, we used an empirical\nstudy to compare the most commonly used phylogenetic methods, namely\nMaximum Parsimony, Maximum likelihood, and Bayesian Inference. We show\nthat the three methods have different performances, especially when the\ndatasets are thin, and argue that the pluralistic analytical approach\nused in most phylogenetic studies can provide valuable, rather than\nredundant, information.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47703","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47703.phy"}]}
