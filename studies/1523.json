Despite its economic importance, higher level\nphylogenetic relationships of Stachybotrys have not been determined nor\nhas a sexual state for S. chartarum been reported. DNA sequences from\nfour nuclear and one mitochondrial gene were analyzed to determine the\nordinal and familial placement of Stachybotrys within the Euascomycota.\nThese data reveal that species of Stachybotrys isolates including S.\nchartarum, S. albipes, for which the sexual state Melanopsamma\npomiformis is reported, species of Myrothecium, and two other tropical\nhypocrealean species form a previously unknown monophyletic lineage\nwithin the Hypocreales. These results suggest that species of\nStachybotrys and Myrothecium are closely related and share\ncharacteristics with other hypocrealean fungi. In addition, S. chartarum\nmay have a sexual state in nature that consists of small, black, fleshy\nperithecia similar to Melanopsamma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocreales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4593.phy"}]}
