Nidulantes. The taxonomic novelty,\nAspergillus mulundensis, is introduced for this historically important\nechinocandin-producing strain. The closely related A. nidulans FGSC A4\nhas one of the most extensively characterized secondary metabolomes of\nany filamentous fungus. Comparison of the full-genome sequences of DSMZ\n5745 and FGSC A4 indicated that the two strains share 33 secondary\nmetabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. These shared gene clusters\nrepresent ~ 45% of the total secondary metabolome of each strain, thus\nindicating a high level intraspecific divergence in terms of secondary\nmetabolism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus mulundensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88961.phy"}]}
