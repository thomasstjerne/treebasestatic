Sequence data\nfrom two non-coding molecular markers (ITS region of nrDNA and trnT-L\nand trnL-F spacers as well as the trnL intron of cpDNA) give support for\na broad taxonomic concept for Raphionacme including Pentagonanthus.\nTogether with Schlechterella, which is sister to Raphionacme, all\nRaphionacme-like taxa form a derived monophyletic group of somewhat\ndiverse species. Sister to the Schlechterella / Raphionacme clade is a\nclade comprised of Stomatostemma and the not truly tuberous vine Mondia.\nIn the nuclear and combined analyses, sister to these two clades\ncombined is a clade formed by Petopentia natalensis and Periploca. In\nconsequence, the recent inclusion of the monotypic South African\nPetopentia in the monotypic Malagasy endemic Ischnolepis is to be\nrejected. Ischnolepis and the other Malagasy Periplocoideae investigated\n(Camptocarpus, Pentopetia) form a basal grade in the combined analysis,\nand a Malagasy origin for Periplocoideae is to be discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Periplocoideae, combined, 3 trees, l=318 steps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Periplocoideae, cpDNA, l=38 steps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Periplocoideae, ITS, 4 trees, l=274 steps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5812.phy"}]}
