Multivariate analysis (ordination\nand classification) of morphometric data is used to resolve the D.\nmimosoides/buxifolia species complex. As a result, one new species, D.\nelliptica, is segregated from D. buxifolia, and a new montane subspecies\n(acris) is recognised within D. mimosoides. Relationships of all taxa in\nthe D. latifolia group are studied using cladistic analysis. A cline\nlinking D. leptophylla with D. mimosoidaes through a hybrid zone is\ndescribed from the Tinderry Mountains near Canberra. Daviesia elliptica,\nD. laevis, D. mimosoides subsp. acris, D. newbeyi, D. pauciflora and D.\nsuaveolens are described as new, and D. mimosoides var. laxiflora is\nraised to species rank. Twelve natural hybrids are briefly\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daviesia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4244.phy"}]}
