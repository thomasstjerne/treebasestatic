Neoscytalidium spp. is a saprophytic crop pathogen, but in\nrecent years some strains have been isolated from human body. In this\nstudy, we report as first time a fungi strain obtained from a patient\nwith cornea ulcer and identified as Neoscytalidium. Morphological\nobservations on conidiogenous cells and molecular/phylogenetic analysis\nreveals a new specie identity, Neoscytalidium oculus sp. nov. Optimal\nconditions for biofilm formation were obtained at a concentration of\n1x106 conidia/ml, during 96 h at 28°C. Micrographs from optical\nmicroscopy confirmed biofilm formation. This is the first report in\nLatin America in which a new species of Neoscytalidium genus from\nclinical isolation had been identified. The biofilm model developed\nconstitute a novel aspect of Neoscytalidium virulence, which could be\ninvolved in human infections","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110609.phy"}]}
