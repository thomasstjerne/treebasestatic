Using a combination of\nmicro-morphological characteristics and sequences of the ribosomal RNA\ngene ITS region, the isolates were classified as six Simplicillium\nspecies, and five of them were previously undescribed. The five species\n(S. aogashimaense, S. cylindrosporum, S. obclavatum, S. subtropicum and\nS. sympodiophorum) were discovered from the Chichi-jima, Hachijo, and\nAogashima islands, and S. minatense was discovered from Honshu. The five\nnew species and three known species are distinguished by conidial\nmorphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Simplicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50560.phy"}]}
