{"Authors":" NA","Year":" 2010","Title":" Morphological and phylogenetic species concepts to\ndistinguish between species in Fusarium subglutinans sensu lato","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" translation elongation factor-1, morphology,\nidentification","DOI":"","Abstract":" Fusarium subglutinans forms part of the Gibberella\nfujikuroi complex. Independent phylogenetic and morphological studies\nhave shown that this is a polyphyletic taxon, which should be treated as\nF. subglutinans sensu lato. The aim of this study was to consider the\nvalue of morphological characters along with DNA sequence data to\ndistinguish species in F. subglutinans sensu lato. Five morphological\ncharacters that have previously been reported as useful to identify\nspecies in this group were evaluated. These included the origin of\nconidiophores with respect to the hyphae on the substrate surface,\nconidiophore branching, the number of conidiogenous openings on the\npolyphialides, macroconidial septation and the presence or absence of\nsterile coiled hyphae. Using these characters, it was possible to\nseparate most of the species from each other. For molecular comparison,\nthe DNA sequences from the translation elongation factor-1, -tubulin\nand calmodulin genes as well as the large subunit of the rDNA gene\nregion were considered. Both the phylogenetic and morphological data\nshow that an integrated approach is needed for the unambiguous\nidentification of species in the Fusarium subglutinans sensu lato\ncomplex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
