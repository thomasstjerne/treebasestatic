These\nfindings now enable a detailed analysis of the evolution of ribosomal\nRNA (rRNA) structure. The origin and diversification of rRNA was here\nstudied using phylogenetic tools directly at the structural level. A\nrooted universal tree was reconstructed from the combined secondary\nstructures of large (LSU) and small (SSU) subunit rRNA using cladistic\nmethods and considerations in statistical mechanics. The evolution of\nthe complete repertoire of structural ribosomal characters was formally\ntraced lineage-by-lineage in the tree, showing a tendency towards\nmolecular simplification and a homogeneous reduction of ribosomal\nstructural change with time. Character tracing revealed patterns of\nevolution in inter-subunit bridge contacts and tRNA-binding sites that\nwere consistent with the proposed coupling of tRNA translocation and\nsubunit movement. These patterns support the concerted evolution of tRNA\nbinding sites in the two subunits and the ancestral nature and common\norigin of certain structural ribosomal features, such as the peptidyl\n(P) site, the functional relay of the penultimate stem helix of SSU\nrRNA, and other structures participating in ribosomal dynamics. Overall\nresults provide a rare insight into the evolution of ribosomal\nstructure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"universal","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4021.phy"}]}
