As such, the evolutionary relationships and hierarchical\nclassification schemes among species have not been confidently\nestablished. Here, we address these points through analyses of DNA\nsequence data from multiple loci (16S rRNA gene, dnaJ, rpoB, and tuf\ngene fragments) using multiple Bayesian and maximum likelihood\nphylogenetic approaches that incorporate nearly all recognized\nStaphylococcus taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51273","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51273.phy"}]}
