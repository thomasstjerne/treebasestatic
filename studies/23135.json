Their unique morphological traits\nincluding sexual and asexual structural characteristics (i.e. sporangial\ntype; oogonial type and ornamentations; type and the number of\nantheridia per oogonium; and oospore type), cardinal temperatures, and\ncolony morphology on various media separated them from other known\nspecies. Using nuclear and mitochondrial genes, each species formed\ndiscrete lineages in phylogenetic analyses based on maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian interference methods. Pathogenicity tests including pre-\nand post-emergence damping-off were also carried out. This paper\ndescribes these four three new Pythium species including Py.\nheteroogonium, Py. longipapillum, and Py. oryzicollum and compares them\nwith their related taxa via morphological features and molecular\ncharacteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113174","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113174.phy"}]}
