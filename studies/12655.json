Although fungi play\na fundamental role in cheese manufacturing and ripening, the taxonomy of\nmany fungal species found in cheese is poorly defined; indeed, this is\nthe case for Mucor spp. In the present study, we assessed the\nphylogenetic relationships among 70 Mucor strains, including 36 cheese\nisolates, by using a five gene phylogenetic approach combined with\nmorphological analyses. Overall, at least six species of Mucor were\nidentified among the cheese isolates including a possible new taxon. The\npresent study also suggests that the genus Mucor comprises undescribed\ntaxa and needs to be properly defined.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Mucor - 18S; 28S; rpb1; mcm7; tsr1-like","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52770.phy"}]}
