The taxonomy and phylogeny of turtles are\nstill under discussion, at least for some clades. Whereas in most\nprevious studies, only a few species or genera were considered, we here\nuse an extensive compilation of DNA sequences from nuclear and\nmitochondrial genes for more than two thirds of the total number of\nturtle species to infer a large phylogeny for this taxon. Our results\nenable us to discuss previous hypotheses on species phylogeny or\ntaxonomy. We are thus able to discriminate between competing hypotheses\nand to suggest taxonomical modifications. Finally, we pinpoint the\nremaining ambiguities for this phylogeny and the species for which new\nsequences should be obtained to improve phylogenetic resolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Testudines","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63637.phy"}]}
