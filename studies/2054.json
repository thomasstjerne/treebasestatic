Understanding the\norigin of this diversity depends on a clearer elucidation of the\nphylogenetic relationships of fungi in the order. One of its core\nmembers is the genus Marchandiomyces, originally established for lichen\npathogens that form orange or coral-colored bulbils. We describe here a\nnew species in the genus, M. marsonii sp. nov., which is unusual in its\nappearance, habit and geographic provenance. It is foliicolous on leaves\nof Pandanus (Screw pines, Pandanaceae) and produces flattened,\ncoral-colored bulbils resembling apothecia of the ascomycete genus\nOrbilia. It is also the first member of the genus to be collected from\nAustralia. An isolate of the new fungus, and several additional cultures\nof related fungi, were obtained and investigated phylogenetically using\nparsimony, likelihood and Bayesian analyses of nuclear small and large\nsubunit ribosomal sequences. Our phylogeny makes clear that\nMarchandiomyces species and their close relatives contribute\nsignificantly to the ecological diversity of the Corticiales, which is\napparently derived mainly from lignicolous ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Corticioid SSU LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5186.phy"}]}
