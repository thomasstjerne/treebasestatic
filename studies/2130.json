Leohumicola levissima and L. atra\nwere isolated from soils collected after forest fires in Crater Lake\nNational Park (USA). Leohumicola incrustata was isolated from burned\nfynbos from the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, South Africa. The\nthree species exhibit characteristic Leohumicola morphology but are\nmorphologically distinct based on conidial characters. Two DNA barcode\nregions, the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) nuclear rDNA region and\nthe cytochrome oxidase subunit I (Cox1) mitochondrial gene, were\nsequenced. Single gene parsimony, dual-gene parsimony and dual-gene\nBayesian inference phylogenetic analyses support L. levissima, L. atra,\nL. incrustata as distinct phylogenetic species. Both ITS and Cox1\nbarcodes are effective for the molecular identification of Leohumicola\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COX1 tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leohumicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5255.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leohumicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5256.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS plus COX1 tree","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leohumicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5257.phy"}]}
