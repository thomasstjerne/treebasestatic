Here, we infer phylogenetic\nrelationships among the species distributed in the area of the eastern\nMediterranean, comparing partial mitochondrial DNA sequences for the\ncytochrome b and 16S rRNA genes. The obtained molecular data clearly\nindicate that Western Palearctic water frogs underwent a basal radiation\ninto at least 3 major lineages (the perezi, the lessonae, and the\nrindibunda/kurtmuelleri lineages) advocating an upper Miocene\nspeciation. Moreover, we consider that within the\nrindibunda/kurtmuelleri lineage, R. (P.) ridibunda, R. (P.) epeirotica,\nR. (P.) cretensis, R. (P.) bedriagae, R. (P.) cerigensis and R. (P.)\nkurtmuelleri were differentiated from a common ancestor through a series\nof vicariant and dispersal events, during the last ~5 Mya, even though\nthe specific rank of some taxa may be questionable, such as R.\ncerigensis in respect with R. bedriagae and R. kurtmuelleri in respect\nwith R. ridibunda.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eastern Mediterranean Rana Populations","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_336.phy"}]}
