They have been\nobserved for their ability to use several classes of petroleum\nhydrocarbon substrates, such as n-alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons as a\nsingle carbon and or in the presence of glucose as a second carbon\nsource to use them for bioremediation of areas contaminated by these\npollutants. In the course of the biodegradation assays, the rate of\ndegradation and the amount of biomass were measured for 21 days by\ngravimetric analysis and gas chromatography coupled with mass\nspectrometry techniques. The results obtained indicate the high capacity\nof Candida parapsilosis followed by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and\nRhodotorula dairenensis to biodegrade the long chain n-alkane, gasoline,\ndiesel and crude oil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Simulated Tree (with character)
