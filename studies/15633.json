The ITS phylogeny supported the placement of the new species\nin the genus Bidens. The new species displays style and cypsela like\nmost species of Bidens, however presents a widely campanulate corolla\nwith long lobes, a extremely reduced involucre, and the pappus lacking\nawns, an unusual set of characteristics for the genus. A key to the\nspecies is accompanied by comments and illustrations of related species.\nBidens goiana B.L.Turner is placed as synonym of B. graveolens Mart. and\na lectotype for B. brasiliensis is designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bidens campanulata relatives","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72562.phy"}]}
