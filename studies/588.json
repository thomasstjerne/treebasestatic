An analysis\nof duplicate phytochrome genes (PHYA and PHYC) is used to root the\nangiosperms, thereby avoiding the inclusion of highly diverged outgroup\nsequences. The results unambiguously place the root near Amborella (one\nspecies, New Caledonia), and resolve water-lilies (Nymphaeales, ~ 70\nspecies, cosmopolitan), then Austrobaileya (one species, Australia), as\nearly branches. These findings bear directly on the interpretation of\nmorphological evolution and diversification within angiosperms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1-not rerooted","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Network of phytochrome A and phytochrome C genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3538.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 Strict","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Network of phytochrome A and phytochrome C genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3540.phy"}]}
