This work adds to the\nknowledge of the family, by introducing a new taxon from dead scales of\npine cones collected on the ground in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand.\nAnalysis of a combined LSU, SSU, RPB2 and TEF1 sequence dataset matrix\nplaced it in Gloniaceae and Purpurepithecium murisporum gen. et sp. nov.\nis introduced to accommodate the new taxon. The genus is characterized\nby erumpent to superficial, navicular hysterothecia, with a prominent\nlongitudinal slit, branched pseudoparaphyses in a gel matrix, with a\npurple pigmented epithecium, hyaline to dark brown muriform ascospores\nand a Psiloglonium stygium-like asexual morph which is produced in\nculture. The new taxon is illustrated and compared with similar genera\nand a new order Gloniales, is introduced to accommodate the monotypic\nfamily Gloniaceae which now comprises three genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"nj","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Purpurepithecium murisporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111721.phy"}]}
