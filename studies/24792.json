Volvox that has previously only been found in Africa.\nDuring field surveys in a large dam lake (Lake Sagami) in Kanagawa\nPrefecture, central Japan, we encountered a Volvox sect. Volvox species\nthat produces dioecious sexual spheroids in the water column. Although\nsexual induction of this species in culture did not produce adequately\nwell-developed sexual spheroids for species identification, molecular\ndata directly obtained from field-collected sexual spheroids verified\nthe identity of field-collected male and female sexual spheroids as well\nas cultured materials. Based on molecular and morphological data, the\nspecies was identified as V. rousseletii. This is the first record of a\ndioecious species of Volvox sect. Volvox in Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox rbcS-psbC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118987.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118988.phy"}]}
