Based on\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses using a combined dataset of ITS, LSU,\nmtSSU, and RPB2 and morphological examinations, Erioscyphella was\ndistinguished from Lachnum and redefined by longer ascospores and the\npresence of apical amorphous materials and/or resinous materials\nequipped on hairs. Species boundaries recognized by morphology/ecology\nand phylogenetic analyses were cross-checked using species delimitation\nanalyses based on DNA barcode sequences downloaded from UNITE, resulting\nin that speciesÂ’ taxonomic problems being uncovered. Six new species (E.\nboninensis, E. insulae, E. otanii, E. papillaris, E. paralushanensis,\nand E. sasibrevispora) and two new combinations (E. hainanensis and E.\nsinensis) were proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ImportTree","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132041.phy"}]}
