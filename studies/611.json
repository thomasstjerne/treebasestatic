In order to orient the Pleurotomariidae within\nGastropoda, partial 18S rDNA sequences were determined for 7\npleurotomariid and 22 other gastropods that span the major groups within\nthe class as well as for one cephalopod and two polyplacophorans, which\nserve as outgroups. Cladistic analyses of a sequence of approximately\n450 base pairs (bp) near the 5â€™ end of the 18S rDNA support the\nmonophyly of the following higher gastropod taxa: Patellogastropoda,\nVetigastropoda, Neritopsina, Apogastropoda, and its subclades\nCaenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. The 18S rDNA sequences and 579 bp of\ncytochrome c oxidase I (COI) analyzed separately and together, indicate\nthat Pleurotomariidae are included within Vetigastropoda but comprise a\nclade that is the sister group to the other families referred to this\norder. Monophyly of the Pleurotomariidae is also supported by the unique\npresence of seven separate inserts (ranging in length from 1 to 68 bp)\nwithin the V2 variable region of the 18S RNA. Relationships of the\ngenera and species within Pleurotomariidae are fully resolved using\ntotal molecular evidence consisting of partial sequences of 18S rDNA and\nCOI and including data on length variation within the inserts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Recent pleurotomariids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Recent pleurotomariids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3594.phy"}]}
