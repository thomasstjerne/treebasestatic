In addition,\nan epitype specimen is selected. Phylogenetic relationships were\ninferred from multigene molecular analysis based on partial sequences of\ngenes for ribosomal RNA polymerase II subunits 1 and 2, translation\nelongation factor 1-Î± and nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacers and\n28S. Ecological context, geographical range and delimitation from\nclosely allied taxa were also are elucidated. B. martaluciae is treated\nas a synonym of C. poikilochromus according to the morphological and\nmolecular comparative study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"299","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupreoboletus LSU+rpb1+rpb2+tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88409.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"299","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Cupreoboletus LSU+rpb1+rpb2+tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88408.phy"}]}
