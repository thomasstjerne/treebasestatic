Aiming to expand knowledge of fungi causing leaf spot\ndiseases in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) from southern Brazil, a\ncomprehensive survey was undertaken. Seven species of plant pathogenic\nfungi were encountered. All species were identified by using a\npolyphasic approach combining morphological, ecological and molecular\nsequences of up to seven genomic loci (actin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde\n3-phosphate dehydrogenase, histone, ITS, LSU and partial translation\nelongation factor 1-α). The pathogenicity of representative strains of\neach species were also tested after artificial inoculations. Among the\nencountered species, Colletotrichum plurivorum and Exserohilum rostratum\nrepresent new-host associations, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Pyrenophora\nnobleae and Pyricularia oryzae are newly reported for Brazil, and\nCercospora lolii and Curvularia lolii are newly described. These results\nform the basis to identify these diseases in the field, which in the\nfuture can help agronomists and farmers to design strategies for\nintegrated control and management in crop-livestock production\nsystems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129664.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129668.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129665.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129666.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129667","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129667.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129669.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bipolaris sorokiniana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129663.phy"}]}
