The result shows that Davalliaceae\ncomprises six clades. Davallia plumosa is sister to Scyphularia\npentaphylla and S. pycnocarpa. Scyphularia triphylla is sister to a\nclade comprising other Scyphularia, Davallia plumosa, D. solida, and\nrelated species, indicating that imparipinnate leaves are derived twice\nwithin the clade. Humata heterophylla is sister to the H. polypodioides\ngroup, one of two groups of Humata, in which Davallia corniculata is\nnested. Paradavallodes multidentatum is nested in Araiostegia +\nDavallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. African Davallia\nchaerophylloides is allied to an Asian and Pacific group comprising D.\ndenticulata and related species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Davalliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1026.phy"}]}
