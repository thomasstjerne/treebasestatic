Based on study of morphology\nand phylogeny, two new species Butyriboletus pseudoroseoflavus and\nTengioboletus subglutinosus are introduced. Morphological evidences and\nphylogenetic analyses of combined dataset (ITS or 28S, rpb1, rpb2 and\ntef1) confirmed them as two new species, and indicated their\nrelationships with other species within their genus. Detailed\ndescription, color photographs and line drawing are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Figure 4.
