Acacia ant-plants that are defended by symbiotic Pseudomyrmex\nants secrete sucrose-free extrafloral nectar, which is unattractive to\ngeneralists. We aimed to investigate whether this extrafloral nectar\nalso can exclude exploiters, i.e.Â non-defending ant species. Mutualist\nworkers discriminated against sucrose while exploiters and generalists\npreferred sucrose, since mutualist workers lacked the sucrose-cleaving\nenzyme invertase, which is present in workers of the other two groups.\nSucrose uptake induced invertase activity in workers of parasites and\ngeneralists, but not mutualists, and in larvae of all species.\nApparently, the mutualists loose invertase during their ontogeny. This\nadaptation seemingly ties the mutualists to their plant hosts, but it\ndoes not completely prevent the mutualism from exploitation. We\ntherefore investigated whether the exploiters studied here are cheaters\n(i.e., have evolved from former mutualists) or parasites (exploiters\nwith no evolutionary history as a mutualist). A molecular phylogeny\ndemonstrates that the exploiter species studied here did not evolve from\nformer mutualists, and no evidence for cheater species was found. We\nconclude that being specialized to their partner can prevent mutualists\nfrom becoming cheaters, while other mechanisms are required to stabilize\na mutualism against the exploitation by parasites.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MB Tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudomyrmex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5418.phy"}]}
