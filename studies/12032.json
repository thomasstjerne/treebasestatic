Here, we report phylogenetic analyses using\n51 genes from the entire chloroplast genome sequences of 20\nrepresentative green plant species. The analyses, using translated amino\nacid sequences, indicated that extant bryophytes (mosses, liverworts,\nand hornworts) form a monophyletic group with high statistical\nconfidence and that extant bryophytes are likely sisters to extant\nvascular plants, although the support for monophyletic vascular plants\nwas not strong. Analyses at the nucleotide level could not resolve the\nbasal relationship with statistical confidence. Bryophyte monophyly\ninferred using amino acid sequences has a good statistical foundation\nand is not rejected statistically by other data sets. We propose\nbryophyte monophyly as the currently best hypothesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bryophytes cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49037.phy"}]}
