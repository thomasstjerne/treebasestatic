Fish egg nutrients are primarily provided by\nvitellogenin (VTG), a large phosphoglycolipoprotein synthesized in the\nmaternal liver and incorporated into oocytes. Fish species typically\nhave multiple VTG paralogs classed as VTGA, VTGB and VTGC. During oocyte\nmaturation VTG is cleaved to form yolk proteins, which are selectively\ndepolymerized in pelagic fish. This creates a pool of free amino acids\n(AA) that drives oocyte hydration enabling buoyancy. Presented here are\nthree full-length VTG sequences of the sand goby (Pomatoschistus\nminutus) a benthic marine teleost and phylogenetic analysis classes them\nVTGA, VTGB and VTGC. Interspecies sequence comparison shows alanine is\nhigher throughout the red seabream lipovitellin domains compared to sand\ngoby. Meta-analysis of VTG of the acanthopterygii clade reveals AA of\nwhole VTGs (and specific domains) correlates with reproductive strategy.\nAmongst others, alanine enrichment is correlated with pelagic egg\nspawning and serine enrichment is correlated with benthic strategies (in\nlipovitellin and Î²-component domains). Interparalogous analysis shows\nalanine and serine levels in VTGA class correlate with that of VTGB. The\nresults reveal VTG domains fated to depolymerize to form the free AA\npool in pelagic fish are particularly enriched with alanine. These\nresults imply the dynamics of VTG composition relates to exploitation of\nnovel breeding strategies and considering the phylogeny of the teleost\nfish implies the pelagic/benthic dichotomy of reproductive strategy has\nevolved in tandem with VTG AA enrichment multiple independent\ntimes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85684.phy"}]}
