It has several advantages, such as its small\ngenome and its diploidy. The recent availability of the complete\nsequence of its genome opens the possibility for further analysis and\nits use as a reference species. Fruit softening is a physiological event\nand involves many biochemical changes that take place at the final\nstages of fruit development; among them, the remodeling of cell walls by\nthe action of a set of enzymes. Xyloglucan\nendotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) is a cell wall-associated enzyme,\nwhich is encoded by a multigene family. Its action modifies the\nstructure of xyloglucans, a diverse group of polysaccharides that\ncrosslink with cellulose microfibrills, affecting therefore the\nfunctional structure of the cell wall. The aim of this work is to\nidentify the XTH-encoding genes present in F. vesca and to determine its\ntranscription level in ripening fruit. Results: The search resulted in\nidentification of 26 XTH-encoding genes named as FvXTHs. Genetic\nstructure and phylogenetic analyses were performed allowing the\nclassification of FvXTH genes into three phylogenetic groups: 17 in\ngroup I/II, 2 in group IIIA and 4 in group IIIB. Two sequences were\nincluded into the ancestral group. Through a comparative analysis,\ncharacteristic structural protein domains were found in FvXTH protein\nsequences. In complement, expression analyses of FvXTHs by qPCR were\nperformed in fruit at different developmental and ripening stages, as\nwell as, in other tissues. The results showed a diverse expression\npattern of FvXTHs in several tissues, although most of them are highly\nexpressed in roots. Their expression patterns are not related to their\nrespective phylogenetic groups. In addition, most FvXTHs are expressed\nin ripe fruit, and interestingly, some of them (FvXTH 18 and 20,\nbelonging to phylogenic group I/II, and FvXTH 25 and 26 to group IIIB)\ndisplay an increasing expression pattern as the fruit ripens.\nConclusion: A discrete group of FvXTHs (18, 20, 25 and 26) increases\ntheir expression during softening of F. vesca fruit, and could take part\nin cell wall remodeling required for softening in collaboration with\nother cell wall degrading enzymes.​","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"FvXTH full-length proteins and other XTH proteins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110219.phy"}]}
