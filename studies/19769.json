Most of the\nspecies in this genus have been recorded from China. In the present\nstudy, four collections of Acervus in Yunnan province, southwestern\nChina were investigated using morphology and DNA sequence data. This\npaper provides detailed morphological descriptions of the sexual morphs\nof A. stipitatus sp. nov. and A. globulosus sp. nov. with morphological\ncomparison of other closely related taxa. Multi-gene phylogenetic\nanalyses inferred from 28S, TEF1 and RPB2 sequence data strongly\nsupported lineages corresponding to morphological features. We also\nprovide a summarized comparison of the major morphological characters of\nAcervus species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ekanayaka Acervus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100267.phy"}]}
