In New Zealand\nthere is an excellent fossil record and accordingly three endemic\nspecies have been cited as providing support for morphological stasis, a\nprerequisite for punctuated equilibrium. Geographic isolation of the New\nZealand fauna reduces the possibility of past dispersal of related\nspecies, events that might be mistaken for speciation in the fossil\nrecord. However, the evolutionary relationships of the New Zealand\nAmalda species have not been studied. The possibility that New Zealand\nAmalda species evolved in isolation is examined here using long DNA\nsequences from both mitochondrial (whole mitogenome) and nuclear (45S\nrDNA) markers from 11 Amalda species collected from New Zealand and\naround the world. Our inferred phylogenies from the mitochondrial and\nnuclear DNA sequences cannot refute the hypothesis that New Zealand\nAmalda are monophyletic, although current sampling represents a fraction\nof the global diversity of Amalda species. The current classification of\nthe New Zealand Amalda into two subgenera is not supported. We estimated\nthe timing of cladogenesis within the New Zealand taxa and resolved\ndates compatible with the fossil record for extant species and\nconsistent with punctuated equilibrium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115739","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115739.phy"}]}
