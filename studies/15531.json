Some of\nthe processes driving the evolution of mimicry rings are likely to\ngenerate incongruent phylogenetic signals across the assemblage, and\nthus pose a challenge for systematics. We use a dataset of 22\nmitochondrial and nuclear markers from 92% of species in the tribe,\nobtained by Sanger sequencing and de novo assembly of short read data,\nto re-examine the phylogeny of Heliconiini with both supermatrix and\nmulti-species coalescent approaches, characterise the patterns of\nconflicting signal and compare the performance of various methodological\napproaches to reflect the heterogeneity across the data. Despite the\nlarge extent of reticulate signal and strong conflict between markers,\nnearly identical topologies are consistently recovered by most of the\nanalyses, although the supermatrix approach fails to reflect the\nunderlying variation in the history of individual loci. However, the\nsupermatrix represents a useful approximation where multiple rare\nspecies represented by short sequences can be incorporated easily. The\nfirst comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny of this group is used to\ntest the hypotheses of a diversification rate increase driven by the\ndramatic environmental changes in the Neotropics over the past 23\nmillion years, or changes caused by diversity-dependent effects on the\nrate of diversification. We find that the rate of diversification has\nincreased on the branch leading to the presently most speciose genus\nHeliconius, but the change occurred gradually and cannot be\nunequivocally attributed to a specific environmental driver. Our study\nprovides comprehensive comparison of philosophically distinct species\ntree reconstruction methods and provides insights into the\ndiversification of an important insect radiation in the most biodiverse\nregion of the planet.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Trh+","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr72138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_72138.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML
