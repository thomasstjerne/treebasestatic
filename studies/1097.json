Little is known\nabout this group, including intrafamilial systematics. The only complete\nphylogenetic hypothesis for this family positions geoemydids as\nparaphyletic with respect to tortoises, but this arrangement has not\nbeen accepted by many workers. We compiled a 79-taxon mitochondrial and\nnuclear DNA data set to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships for 65\nspecies and subspecies representing all 23 genera of the Geoemydidae.\nMaximum parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses and Bayesian\nanalysis produced similar, well-resolved trees. Our analyses identified\nthree main clades comprising the tortoises (Testudinidae), the old-world\nGeoemydidae, and the South American geoemydid genus Rhinoclemmys. Within\nGeoemydidae, many nodes were strongly supported, particularly based on\nBayesian posterior probabilities of the combined three-gene dataset. We\nfound that adding data for a subset of taxa improved resolution of some\ndeeper nodes in the tree. Several strongly supported groupings within\nthe Geoemydidae demonstrate nonmonophyly of some genera and possible\ninterspecific hybrids, and we recommend several taxonomic revisions\nbased on available evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geoemydidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1683.phy"}]}
