Phylogenetic analysis of multi-gene\nsequence data placed them in Savoryella (Savoryellaceae), grouping with\nan unidentified strain isolated from submerged wood in a saline\nenvironment, but distinct from other Savoryella species. In this paper,\nwe propose a new combination as Savoryella nypae based on Trichocladium\nnypae and a new species Savoryella sarushimana. Savoryella sarushimana\ndiffers from S. nypae in having larger conidial dimensions, with a rough\nto spiny surface and the proliferation of conidia. Detail morphological\nfeatures coupled with sporulation in culture of the new taxa are\nillustrated. Notes on their phylogenetic placement of the discussed taxa\nand emendation of the genus Savoryella are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118280.phy"}]}
