Twenty-three of them are described here as new species. The\nmajority of the species are currently known only from a single\ncontinent. Epitypes are proposed for H. repandum and H. rufescens. The\nbarcodes produced in this study are deposited in the RefSeq database and\nused as a basis to name Species Hypothesis in UNITE. Eleven infrageneric\nclades were recovered in our phylogenetic analysis. They were supported\nby morphological characteristics and are herein formally recognized:\nsubgenera Albi, Hydnum, Pallidi, and Rufescentes, sections Hydnum,\nOlympici, Magnorufescentes, and Rufescentes, and subsections\nMulsicolores, Rufescentes and Tenuiformia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118267.phy"}]}
