Although L. discoidea and L. glandulosa\nretain complete interfertility, nuclear rDNA data for the two species\nare almost free of evolutionary noise, without evidence of gene flow\nbetween them; allopatric divergence of L. discoidea cannot be ruled out.\nMolecular data are consistent with an hypothesis of accelerated\nmorphological evolution of L. discoidea and Gottlieb et al.’s suggestion\nthat the closest relatives of L. discoidea are populations of L.\nglandulosa with yellow, rather than white, ray corollas, in accord with\nClausen, Keck, and Hiesey’s finding of a gene for yellow ray coloration\nin the ray-less L. discoidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Layia glandulosa + L. discoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2269.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 (not printed)","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Layia glandulosa + L. discoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2268.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Layia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2270.phy"}]}
