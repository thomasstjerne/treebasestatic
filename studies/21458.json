The obtained ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences were examined by\nBayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analyses. Intra- and interspecific\nvariation was also investigated based on molecular distances in the ITS\nregion. The phylogenetic analyses supported the specific distinctness of\nCapitotricha rubi and Capitotricha from Nothofagus, but suggest also\nspecific distinctness among samples from Quercus, Fagus, and Alnus. The\ninterspecific absolute distances were larger than intraspecific absolute\ndistances for all examined units. The smallest absolute distance was\nfound between “Alnus alnobetula” and “Fagus sylvatica” units.\nPhyllogenetic relationships within Brunnipila are discussed and two new\nsequences of Brunnipila are published. Capitotricha, Lachnum and\nErioscyphella are compared to each other based on hair and excipulum\ncharacteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106459","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106459.phy"}]}
