Ramaraomyces corticola was described nine\nyears after Ps. indicum with very similar micro-morphological\ncharacters. Both genera are monotypic. The holotype of Ps. indicum is\ndepauperate. We re-collected Ps. indicum near the type locality. In this\npaper, we lectotypify the genus and species with the original\nillustration, and epitypify the species with a new specimen. An\nex-epitype culture was derived from the epitype specimen and used to\nsequence regions of the nuclear RNA operon to determine the phylogenetic\nrelationships of the species. The fungus belongs to the recently\ndescribed family Wiesneriomycetaceae in the Tubeufiales, forming a\nsister group with the sporodochial, slimy spored genus Wiesneriomyces.\nWe clarify the generic concept of Pseudogliophragma, propose\nRamaraomyces as a synonym, and provide a new description and\nillustration. Wiesneriomyces laurinus is reported for the first time\nfrom Canada","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wiesneriomycetaceae Bayesian analysis SSU and LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79638.phy"}]}
