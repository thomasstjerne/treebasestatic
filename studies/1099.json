The conidia are subfusiform, flattened on one side\nand produced in groups of two to three in a dense mucoid ball at the end\nof each phialide. Parsimony analysis of aligned internal transcribed\nspacer rDNA sequences suggests that H. uncinata is closely related to\nthe Cordyceps sinensis complex (Clavicipitaceae, Hypocreales), which\nincludes species with morphologically similar anamorphs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1687.phy"}]}
