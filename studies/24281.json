Identity of the type species\nof Hydnoporia, Sistotrema fuscescens (= Hydnoporia olivacea in current\nsense), is clarified, and a lectotype is selected. In total, 12 species\nare combined in Hydnoporia: H. corrugata, H. gigasetosa, H. lamellata,\nH. laricicola, H. latesetosa, H. lenta, H. rhododendri, H. rimosa, H.\nsubrigidula, H. tabacina, H. tabacinoides, and H. yasudai. Hydnoporia\ndiffissa is described as new. Analyses of all available ITS (94) and\nnewly produced tef1 sequences (20) indicate that there are at least 20Â–27\nspecies in the genus. Identity of the type species of Hymenochaete, H.\nrubiginosa, is clarified; the name is retained for the species so named\nin Europe while other species are present in North America and East\nAsia. Additionally, three new combinations in Hymenochaete are proposed:\nH. campylopora (= Cyclomyces fuscus), H. microcycla (= Cyclomyces\ntabacinus), and H. saepiaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnoporia ITS 94x2765","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121668.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnoporia ITS 12x660","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121669.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hydnoporia TEF1 19x1124","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121670.phy"}]}
