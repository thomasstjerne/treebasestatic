In the\ncurrent study, samples of the Favolaschia calocera from America,\nAustralia, China, Kenya, Italy, New Zealand and Thailand are analyzed.\nOur study proves that Favolaschia calocera is a species complex, and six\nspecies are recognized in the complex including five new species. One\nnew species is discovered from Australia, namely Favolaschia claudopus,\nfour new species are found from China, namely F. brevibasidiata, F.\nbrevistipitata, F. longistipitata and F. minutissima. Phylogenetically,\nthese five new species form five independent lineages based on ITS\ndataset and ITS + nLSU + mt-SSU + nu-SSU + TEF1 dataset. Illustrated\ndescriptions of these five new species are given. An identification key\nand a comparison of the characteristics to spe-cies of the Favolaschia\ncalocera complex are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133129.phy"}]}
