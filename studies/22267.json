In most cases, the inhalation of spores is\nharmless due to efficient clearance, but in humans with immunodeficiency\ninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) can develop which has a high\nmortality rate. This fungus can cause also non-invasive infections in\nhumans and animals, for example sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA) in\notherwise immunocompetent dogs. A factor that could influence the\ninfection process is the inherent isolate variability within this fungal\nspecies. Within this context we have compared different isolates of A.\nfumigatus using genetic and phenotypic methods in order to find clues\nabout the features that determine the virulence of A. fumigatus","trees":[{"tree_label":"caM","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"caM","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109979.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109978","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109978.phy"}]}
