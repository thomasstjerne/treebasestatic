The\nnew species is characterized by semi-immersed, subglobose or\nellipsoidal, papillate, conical ascomata, clavate to subcylindrical,\nshort pedicellate asci and 3-septate, fusoid to ellipsoidal ascospores\nwith rounded ends, and pale brown to dark brown central cells and\nhyaline end cells. The asexual morph has multiseptate, filiform,\nintercalary, catenate, branched chlamydospores that resemble Xylomyces.\nThe asexual morph of Keissleriella phragmiticola based on combined LSU,\nSSU, ITS and TEF1 sequence analyses, is reported. The role of molecular\nidentification in delineating cryptic species are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120442","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120442.phy"}]}
