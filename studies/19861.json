The new species differs from other\nConidiobolus species by forming mycelial strand with 2Â–6 aerial\nphototropic hyphae, and by its two types of primary conidiophores: one\nis shorter and differentiated from aerial hyphae, the other is often\nlonger and inflated and arises from substrate mycelia. Molecular\nphylogeny inferred from the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA supports\nC. stilbeus as a distinct species in the genus Conidiobolus, most\nclosely related to C. lachnodes, C. sinensis, C. stromoideus and C.\nthromboides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98455.phy"},{"tree_label":"Conidiobolus stilbeus","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98450.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98454.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98456","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98456.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98457","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98457.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98458","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98458.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98459","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98459.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98460","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98460.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98461","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98461.phy"}]}
