Phylogenetic relationships among the 22\ncalamoid genera are investigated here in simultaneous analyses of\nmorphological data and DNA sequences from nuclear ITS regions and\nchloroplast rps16 intron. The resultant hypotheses of relationship are\nused to explore morphological character evolution through an examination\nof character state optimisations. The evolution of habit and its\nassociated characters is found to be highly homoplasious; for example,\nmultiple origins of both the acaulescent and climbing growth forms have\nbeen identified. Similarly, life history and reproductive characters\nshow complex patterns of evolution with few primary homology assessments\nproving to be effective judgements of synapomorphy. Many of these\nhomoplasious characters were emphasised in the previous classification\nof the Calamoideae and consequently some non-monophyletic groups were\nrecognised formally. We present a new classification in which a number\nof unexpected, group-defining characters, such as the number of pollen\napertures, have been identified. The classification comprises three\ntribes and nine subtribes, including one newly described tribe\nEugeissoneae. However, the morphology of many well supported clades\nremains poorly understood, creating further challenges for future\nstudies in calamoid phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae/morphology/successive weights","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3517.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae/DNA+Morphology/Equal weights","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3518.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae/DNA+morphology/equal weights","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3519.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae/DNA+morphology/successive weights","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3520.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae tree for character optimization","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calamoideae tree for character optimization","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3522.phy"}]}
