In this study,\nwe sequenced three DNA regions of Microdendron: the nuclear 18S, and\nchloroplast rbcL and trnL-F. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that\nMicrodendron is nested within Pogonatum, suggesting that the genus\nshould not be recognized. Additionally we found an indel in the trnL\nintron region shared by the two genera, which also indicates the close\nrelationship between them. Moreover, the probable allies of Microdendron\nsinense Broth. within Pogonatum are suggested based on detailed\ninvestigation under the scanning electron microscope.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Taxonomic Reassessment of Microdendron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2510.phy"}]}
