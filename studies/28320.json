These specialized infection\nstructures have evolved into various morpho-types: proto-appressoria,\nhyaline appressoria, melanised (dark) appressoria and compound\nappressoria. In this review, we discuss the differences in the\nformation, differentiation and function of appressoria in fungal groups\nwith diversified life-strategies. Using DNA sequence information, LSU,\n5.8S, SSU and RPB2 gene fragments, we reconstructed the ancestral states\nfor appressorial types in the main phyla of fungi and fungus-like\norganisms, and found hyaline appressoria to be the most ancestral form.\nOur analysis estimated proto-appressoria diversification during the\nearly Mesozoic (209Â–379 MYA), however, the current ancestral analysis\ndoes not establish a strong conclusion regarding their origin. Our data\nsuggest that these hyaline appressoria diversified into melanised or\ncompound appressoria, with evidence of adaptive radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131395","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131395.phy"}]}
