Special emphasis is placed on species\nof the genus Pseudocercospora, which are in part also phylogenetically\nanalysed, using a multilocus approach. Species of the latter genus\nproved to be very diverse, with a remarkable degree of cryptic\nspeciation. Seven new species are described (Pseudocercospora\ndiospyri-japonicae, P. diospyri-loti, P. diospyriphila P. ershadii, P.\nkakicola, P. kobayashiana, and P. tesselata), and two new names are\nintroduced (P. kakigena [ Cylindrosporium kaki, non Pseudocercospora\nkaki], and Zasmidium diospyri-hispidae [ Passalora diospyri, non\nZasmidium diospyri]). Six taxa are lectotypified (Cercospora atra, C.\ndiospyri, C. diospyri var. ferruginea, C. flexuosa, C. fuliginosa, C.\nkaki) and Pseudocercospora kaki is epitypified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora act+ITS+tef+rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124895.phy"}]}
