This fungus is proposed as a new species, namely,\nElaphomyces tropicalis, based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of ITS\nrDNA sequence and morphological characters examination. Sequences of E.\ntropicalis formed a distinct clade, which was sister to E. granulatus\nand E. asperulus. Morphologically, E. tropicalis is distinct from E.\ngranulatus and E. asperulus by peridium with minute dark brown polygonal\nscales on light brown background, marble pattern in the section of inner\nperidium, smaller ascospores (9‒) 15‒17(‒18.5) µm diam., with\nlabyrinth-like ascospore ornamentation. Shorea selanica and S. leprosula\nwere the host of E. tropicalis, enlarging previous knowledge of\nElaphomyces host ranges","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101852","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101852.phy"}]}
