P.\nramorum is also present on Rhododendron, Camellia, and Viburnum in the\nnursery industry, which is thought to have been the pathway for its\nspread into new geographic regions including forests and natural\necosystems. Three lineages of P. ramorum have been described, informally\ndesignated EU1, NA1, and NA2, and each lineage is believed to originate\nfrom an as yet unknown exotic centre of origin. Preliminary SSR and\nsequence analysis of isolates from a UK P. ramorum survey revealed seven\nisolates with profiles that did not match the previously known lineages.\nDetailed SSR and multilocus sequence analysis of these isolates are\npresented, allowing us to assign these isolates to a new P. ramorum\nlineage, designated EU2. Although the known geographical origin of these\nisolates is currently limited to Northern Ireland and western Scotland,\nthe EU2 lineage isolates have been obtained from four different host\nplants, including Japanese larch. All isolates are of A1 compatibility\ntype, which implies that this finding does not increase the risk of\noutcrossing with the EU1 lineage isolates already present in the UK. The\noldest EU2 strain was isolated in 2007 but no SSR-based intraEU2 lineage\ngenotypic diversity was detected. The combination of these elements\npoints to a recent introduction, despite emergency phytosanitary\nmeasures to control introduction and spread. A PCR-RFLP method for the\nrapid identification of EU2 lineage isolates is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cox1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Cox1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57181.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cox2","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Cox2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57182.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 gwEuk","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum gwEuk","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57178.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Trp1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Trp1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57179.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cox1-Cox2-Prv8-Prv9-Prv11","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Cox1-Cox2-Prv8-Prv9-Prv11","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57180.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Prv8","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Prv8","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57183.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Avh121","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Avh121","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57176.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Avh120","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Avh120","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57175.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 Btub","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Btub","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57177.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Prv9","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Prv9","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Prv11","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora ramorum Prv11","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57185.phy"}]}
