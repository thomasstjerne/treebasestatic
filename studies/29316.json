Their fungal diversity is more fascinating but\nhas been relatively poorly studied or restricted to a few important\nhosts or pathogens. Therefore, numerous grass inhabiting fungal species\nare awaiting discovery or re-study based on morphology and molecular\nphylogeny. In an ongoing study of grasses inhabiting fungi in Thailand,\ntwo interesting saprobic members of Sodariomycetes were collected. Based\non morphology, coupled with combined gene analyses of LSU and ITS\nsequence data, they were identified as Dinemasporium pseudostrigosum and\nRobillarda africana belonging to Chaetosphaeriaceae and Sporocadaceae,\nrespectively. This is the first report of the two species for Thailand\nas well as the first record of R. africana occurring on grasses. The\nnewly collected species are compared to other related species and\ncomprehensive descriptions and photo-micrographs are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135389","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135389.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135392","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135392.phy"}]}
