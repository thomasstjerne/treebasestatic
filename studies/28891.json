Zhao sp. nova (Schizoporaceae, Hymenochaetales) is\nproposed based on morphological and molecu\u0002lar evidence. Fasciodontia\nyunnanensis is characterised by resupinate basidiomata with minutely\nodontioid hymenial surface and presence of submoniliform cystidia, and\nellipsoid thick-walled basidiospores (3.15.7 × 2.14.1 µm). Sequences of\nITS and 28S rDNA gene regions were generated, and phylogenetic analyses\nwere performed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference methods. In the phylogenetic reconstruction of Hyphodontia s.\nlato based on a concatenated ITS + 28S data set, the new species nested\nin Fasciodontia where it formed a mono\u0002phyletic lineage and grouped with\nF. brasiliensis and F. bugellensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134090.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134091.phy"}]}
