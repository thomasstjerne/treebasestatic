In most of the examined lower\naraneomorphs–some 20 families of hypochiloids, austrochiloids, and\nclassical Haplogynae (including the cribellate family\nFilistatidae)–there is no evidence of cylindrical gland spigots. Only in\nthe Leptonetidae and Telemidae do females have a spigot type, on both\nthe posterior median and posterior lateral spinnerets, that is not also\npresent in males, and that may therefore serve cylindrical glands.\nCylindrical glands seem otherwise to be synapomorphic for a large group\nof about 70 higher araneomorph families corresponding roughly to the\nclassical concept of Entelegynae (but including those palpimanoid and\norbicularian taxa with haplogyne females). A data matrix including 67\ncharacters for 35 haplogyne and eight related genera, belonging to 36\nfamilies, is presented and analyzed. The results suggest that the\nclassical Haplogynae form a monophyletic group but that the superfamily\nScytodoidea is paraphyletic. Paracribellar spigots, previously reported\nonly on the posterior median spinnerets, apparently occur also on the\nposterior lateral spinnerets of austrochilids and filistatids. The\nfamily Loxoscelidae is placed as a junior synonym of Sicariidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 311","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haplogyne spiders, preferred tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5631.phy"}]}
