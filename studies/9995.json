Phylogenetic\nanalyses of sequence data from the transcribed spacers of nuclear\nribosomal DNA (ETS, ITS) indicate that section Carnosa Jacq.-FÃ©l. (1\nsp., East-Africa and Madagascar) is a divergent element that is best\ntreated at the subgeneric level. Its sister-group is subgenus Warneckea\nin which the analyses found three major lineages together forming a\nbasal trichotomy. These three lineages represent section Strychnoidea\n(western and central Africa), section Warneckea (East-Africa,\nMadagascar, and Mauritius), and a third group with three West-African\nspecies (W. fascicularis, W. guineensis, and W. mangrovensis) comprising\nthe newly proposed section Guineensea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Warneckea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6525.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Warneckea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6603.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Warneckea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6385.phy"}]}
