Palola currently\ncontains fourteen morphologically similar species, mostly from shallow,\ntropical waters. In this study, 60 specimens of Palola from nine\nlocations in the tropical North Pacific and the Caribbean were sequenced\nfor the two mitochondrial markers cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S\nribosomal RNA to infer phylogenetic relationships, genetic diversity and\nphylogeography within the taxon. Phylogenetic analysis was performed\nusing Bayesian statistics and parsimony. Vouchers of the same specimens\nwere examined morphologically. Two major clades (A and B) can be\ndistinguished within the monophyletic Palola. A number of individuals in\nclade B bear rows of ventral eyespots in the posterior body region,\ntypical for swarming P. viridis and probably a synapomorphy for clade B.\nNo morphological synapomorphy was found for clade A. Haplotypes from\ndivergent clades often co-occur in the same location. Some haplotypes\nare geographically widespread, in one case covering the entire east-west\nexpansion of the tropical Pacific. These results imply that despite the\napparent absence of teleplanic larvae in eunicid polychaetes,\nlong-distance dispersal is possible in at least some lineages of\nPalola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Palola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_915.phy"}]}
