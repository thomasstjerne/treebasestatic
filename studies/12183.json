Combining a multilocus genealogical and\nmorphological study, we aimed to document the diversity within\nLactifluus volemus sensu lato of Sikkim Himalaya. We compared nuclear\nITS and LSU rDNA, nuclear rpb1 and rpb2 protein-coding, and\nmitochondrial atp6 protein-coding genealogies to determine species\nboundaries. Interspecific relationships were inferred from the combined\ndataset. Bayesian and maximum likelihood single-locus genealogies are\nconcordant and support recognition of 6 species. Three of these could be\nidentified by unique morphological characteristics and are described as\nnew species: L. dissitus, L. leptomerus and L. versiformis. Five out of\nsix species were found to coexist in sympatry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50063","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50063.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50064","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50064.phy"}]}
