A\nfire response trait that allows plants to cope with frequent fire by\neither reseeding or resprouting could differentially affect rates of\nspecies diversification. However, little is known about the generality\nof the effects of differing fire response on species evolution. We study\nthis question in the Restionaceae, a family that radiated in Southern\nAfrica and Australia. These radiations occurred independently and\nrepresent evolutionary replicates. We apply Bayesian approaches to\nestimate trait-specific diversification rates and patterns of climatic\nniche evolution. We also compare the climatic heterogeneity of South\nAfrica and Australia. Reseeders diversify faster than resprouters in\nSouth Africa, but not in Australia. We show that climatic preferences\nevolve more rapidly in reseeder lineages than in resprouters and that\nthe optima of these climatic preferences differ between the two\nstrategies. We find that South Africa is more climatically heterogeneous\nthan Australia, independent of the spatial scale we consider. We propose\nthat rapid shifts between states of the fire response trait promote\nspeciation by separating species ecologically, but this only happens\nwhen the landscape is sufficiently heterogeneous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"386","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63508","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63508.phy"}]}
