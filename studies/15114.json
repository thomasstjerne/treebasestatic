Further examination showed\nconsistent differences in colour pattern and the internal anatomy that\nbecame evident only once the molecular outcomes were analysed. Moreover,\nthe original description of Anteaeolidiella indica suggests that this\nspecies has a very particular colour pattern that is not present in any\nof our specimens. A review of the literature led us to resurrect the\nnames of Anteaeolidiella cacaotica (Stimpson, 1855), Anteaeolidiella\nsaldanhensis (Barnard, 1927), Anteaeolidiella takanosimensis (Baba,\n1930) and Anteaeolidiella lurana (Ev. Marcus & Er. Marcus, 1967).\nAeolidiella chromosoma (Cockerell & Eliot, 1905) and Aeolidiella\noliviae (MacFarland, 1966) are transferred to Anteaeolidiella based on\nour morphological and molecular data. Finally, three new species from\nthe Indo-Pacific are here described.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"256","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anteaeolidiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69306.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"256","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anteaeolidiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69307.phy"}]}
