Very little is known regarding the\nophiostomatoid fungi associated with bark beetles in Spain. A previous\nstudy of sapstain fungi associated with fourteen insect species\ncolonizing Pinus radiata in northern Spain yielded nineteen fungal\nspecies including three common pathogens and four important agents of\nsapstain of lumber. Three new species of Ophiostoma were recognized in\nthe present study based on comparisons of sequence data for three gene\nregions as well as morphological characteristics. The new taxa are\ndescribed as Ophiostoma nebulare sp. nov., Ophiostoma euskadiense sp.\nnov., and Graphilbum crescericum sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52079.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52077.phy"}]}
