Maximum parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood, and Bayesian analyses all support two major clades within\nthe ingroup. The first clade includes members of Bryum sections\nApalodictyon, Caespiticia, Capillaria, and Leucodontium, and Plagiobryum\nzieri, and we suggest that the species of this clade comprise an own\ngenus. The second clade contains representatives from all the included\nBryum sections (except Capillaria) plus Acidodontium, Anomobryum,\nBrachymenium section Dicranobryum, and Haplodontium. Within this clade,\nBrachymenium section Dicranobryum is closely related to Bryum section\nBryum. This suggests that the representatives of section Brachymenium\nincluded in this study should be accommodated in Bryum. Finally, the\nstrong support for a clade with B. alpinum and B. coronatum indicate\nthat these taxa should be separated from Bryum at the genus level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"clade within Bryaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4089.phy"}]}
