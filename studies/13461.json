The new\nspecies is characterized by black, partially immersed, flattened,\nglobose ascomata; fissitunicate, long, slender, obclavate asci; and\none-septate, hyaline, fusiform ascospores with bipolar appendages, each\ncovered with a gelatinous cap. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses\nof partial 18S nrDNA and 28S nrDNA, as well as the entire nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) region\nsupport the placement and establishment of this new species in the\nLindgomycetaceae, Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindgomycetaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57817.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lindgomycetaceae SSU LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57816.phy"}]}
