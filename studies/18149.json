The emphasis was on the âRhodopolioidâ\ngroup, established here as subgenus Rhodopolia. Morphological\nexaminations were accompanied by molecular methods with ITS and RPB2\nsequences. Fifty-eight type specimens, including twelve from eastern\nNorth America, were examined and forty-two of them were sequenced. E.\nrhodopolium is neotypified. Further, E. caccabus and E. subradiatum are\nlectotypified. Nine species are described as new: E. boreale, E.\neminens, E. lupinum, E. palustre, E. paragaudatum, E. radicipes, E.\nrivulare, E. serpens, all belonging to subg. Rhodopolia, and the unique\nE. mirum, which has both pink and dark brown fruitbodies. E. majaloides\nand E. sericatum were found to be highly morphologically and genetically\nvariable and occured in various habitats, from lowlands to the alpine\nzone. Generally, the macro- and micromorphological features often showed\nconsiderable intraspecific variation. Several species were found to be\nsynonymous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 41","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entoloma ML tree of ITS sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_90914.phy"}]}
