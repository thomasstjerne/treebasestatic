Although these regions are mostly conserved as National\nParks due to the specific nature and biome, quite limited fungal biota\nis reported currently. We examined mushroom fungi under such environment\nand found a unique yellowish-cap Tricholoma species. Multi-gene\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis and morphological observation for the\nspecimens showed that the Tricholoma species position to the sister\nclade to T. fumosoluteum known in the North America under\nalpinesubalpine zones. The Japanese yellowish-cap Tricholoma species\nshowed larger basidium size and pileipellis hyphal width as compared to\nT. fumosoluteum, In addition, the Japanese yellowish-cap Tricholoma\nspecies had cheilocystidia on the gill edge. Thus, we describe the\nfungus as T. alpinus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gen.250000","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131692","tree_kind":"Species
