Affected plants initially had small,\ncircular or oblong spots, dark brown in color on their leaves.\nFrequently, spots on the leaves would coalesce into large lesions with\ndark brownish-black margins. Leaf blight may occur under high disease\npressure, resulting in black patches 2- to 15-cm in diameter on close\nmown turf such as golf course putting greens and fairways. Symptomatic\nleaf samples were collected from infected plants and cultured on potato\ndextrose agar. A sterile, filamentous fungus was isolated in pure\nculture. On the basis of colony morphology and combined sequences of the\ninternal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase (GAPDH) and translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF-1α),\nthe fungus was identified as Curvularia malina. Pathogenicity testing by\nartificial inoculation showed C. malina isolates were pathogenic to\nhealthy hybrid bermudagrass and Kochs postulates were fulfilled by\nre-isolating the pathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Curvularia ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109519.phy"}]}
