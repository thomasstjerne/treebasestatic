The Mujin vent field (62°11.79ʹS) is the most southern record for\na Kiwa species searched to date, in a region located in the large,\nunexplored gap of the Circum-Antarctic Ridge system. Kiwa araonae n. sp.\nis the fourth described species in the family Kiwaidae, and the second\nfrom the Southern Ocean. This new species differs morphologically from\nother species of Kiwa (K. hirsuta, K. puravida, K. tyleri), by the\npresence of a combination characters: nearly flat branchial region,\nrelatively short rostrum, third sternite with parallel lateral margins,\nslender chela, straight fingers, and propodus of pereopods with three\ncorneous spines on the flexor margins. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree\nand the genetic distance based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (408\nbp) clearly indicate the distinctiveness of this species. The discovery\nof Kiwa araonae n. sp. in the AAR of the Southern Ocean, suggests the\npossibility of a biogeographic connection of the Southern Ocean vent\nfauna. Also, the presence of a new hydrothermal vent field with endemic\nspecies in the AAR provides additional information on the global\nbiogeography of deep-sea vent faunas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"16S_BI_tree_fin2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93113.phy"}]}
