This report\nprovides additional list consisting of 3 species of the genus Erysiphe\nand its asexual morph (Pseudoidium) on various hosts found in Thailand.\nMorphological descriptions of powdery mildew specimens on 11 plant\nfamilies and molecular phylogenetic analyses based on ITS rDNA sequences\nare provided. We reported 6 new host records for Erysiphe in the world,\nviz., Wrightia arborea (Apocynaceae), Hydrocotyle javanica (Araliaceae),\nCleome chelidonii (Cleomaceae), Viburnum inopinatum (Caprifoliaceae),\nLuffa acutangula (Cucurbitaceae), Ostodes paniculata (Euphorbiaceae). In\naddition, 10 new records of Erysiphe found in Thailand were\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107187.phy"}]}
