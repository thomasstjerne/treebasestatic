Assemblies were verified by PCR\nand by cross-mapping reads to related genomes. ● The plastid genomes of\nthe Droseraceae show multiple rearrangements, gene losses and expansion\nor contraction of the inverted repeat. All the ndh genes are lost or\nnon-functional, as well as clpP1 and in some of the species, ycf1, ycf2\nand some essential tRNA genes. Uniquely amongst land plants, the trnK\ngene has no intron. ● Carnivory in the Droseraceae induces changes in\nplastid gene content similar to those induced by parasitism and\nmycoheterotrophy, suggesting parallel changes in chloroplast function\ndue to the similar switch from autotrophy to (mixo-) heterotrophy. A\nmolecular phylogeny of the taxa based on all shared plastid genes\nindicates that the ‘snap-traps’ of Aldrovanda and Dionaea have a common\norigin.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Droseraceae tree based on concatenated plastid gene\nalignments","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105571","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105571.phy"}]}
