Although the mechanism and evolutionary importance of\nparamutation behaviors remain largely unknown, genetic screens in maize\n(Zea mays) have identified five components affecting 24 nucleotide RNA\nbiogenesis as required to maintain repression of a paramutant purple\nplant1 (pl1) allele. Currently, the RNA polymerase IV largest subunit\nrepresents the only component that also specifies proper development.\nHere we identify a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding 3 (CHD3) protein\northologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PICKLE as a second\ncomponent maintaining both pl1 paramutation, and normal somatic\ndevelopment. In addition, genetic tests show this protein also\ncontributes to proper male gametophyte function. In contrast to all\npreviously characterized chromodomains which bind histone 3 methylated\nlysines, we found the tandem chromodomains of this CHD3 have highest\naffinity for acetylated histone 4 lysine 16 peptides. Cross-species\ncomparisons of the corresponding Arabidopsis and maize mutants implicate\na conserved developmental program with genes responsible for gibberellin\nbiosynthesis as common dysregulated targets. In contrast, developmental\ndefects associated with the two paramutation mutants are largely\ndistinct. Our results indicate that nucleosome dynamics are responsible\nfor maintaining pl1 paramutation, normal plant ontogeny, and sperm\ntransmission.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
