Historically,\nthis species has been variously included in Verbesina, Wedelia, and\nWollastonia, and its position has never been investigated from a\nmolecular phylogenetic perspective. Based on chloroplast DNA sequences,\nwe revealed that I. montana is only remotely related to these genera,\nbeing sister to Synedrella with strong support. This topology is also\nsignificantly favored by the statistical topology tests. The generic\nstatus of Indocypraea is further supported by having achenes brownish\nyellow and densely dotted with white or yellowish white mottles, and a\nbase chromosome number of x = 37, both of which are distinct in the\nsubtribe Ecliptinae. Additionally, we clarify the identity of Wedelia\nwallichii var. megalantha, and synonymize it with I. montana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best ML tree with bootstrap value","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98326","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98326.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI tree with node support","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indocypraea BI with node support","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98329.phy"},{"tree_label":"Major-rule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indocypraea Major-rule consensus","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98328.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Indocypraea 1 & 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100274.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict consensus MP tree","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98327","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98327.phy"}]}
