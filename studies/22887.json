A new ascomycete species, Acuminatispora palmarum,\ninhabiting decayed petioles and rachides of palms in mangrove habitats,\nis introduced in this paper, based on morphological and phylogenetic\nevidence. Phylogenetic relationships of related taxa were inferred from\ncombined LSU, SSU, TEF1Î± and RPB2 sequences data, and the analyses\nindicate that A. palmarum could be recognized as a distinct group, but\nits familial placement needs to be further resolved. The morphological\ncharacters of this new taxon are also different from other members in\nPleosporales by its deeply immersed ascomata with an erumpent short\nneck, and fusiform ascospores having acute or narrowly pointed ends.\nAcuminatispora gen. nov. (Pleosporales, incertae sedis) is therefore\nestablished to accommodate the new taxon A. palmarum. Furthermore,\nphylogenetic relationship of Acrocordiopsis and Caryospora were\ndiscussed with a consideration of morphological characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acuminatispora palmarum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112321.phy"}]}
