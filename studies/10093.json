An investigation of the\nmortality of rooted Pinus cuttings in a commercial forest nursery in\nColombia led to the isolation of two Cylindrocladium anamorphs of\nCalonectria species. The aim of this study was to identify these species\nusing DNA sequence data and morphological comparisons. Two species were\nidentified, namely one undescribed species, and Cy. gracile, which is\nallocated to Calonectria as Ca. brassicae. The new species, Calonectria\nbrachiatica sp. nov., resides in the Ca. brassicae species complex.\nPathogenicity tests with Ca. brachiatica and Ca. brassicae showed that\nboth are able to cause disease on Pinus maximinoi and P. tecunumanii. An\nemended key is provided to distinguish between Calonectria species with\nclavate vesicles and 1-septate macroconidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria (Cylindrocladium) species associated with\ndying Pinus cuttings","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6437.phy"}]}
