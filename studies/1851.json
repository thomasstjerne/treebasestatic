It is characterized by a unique colour pattern consisting of\nred transverse and longitudinal bands. We determine its phylogenetic\nposition within Myrianida using a combined approach with morphological\nand molecular data. The new species is compared to relevant Myrianida\ntaxa and important features for morphological identification are listed\nin a table. The new combinations Myrianida tyrrhenica (Cognetti, 1953)\nand M. cognetti (Çinar & Gambi, 2005) are introduced, and A.\nantondohrni Çinar & Gambi, 2005, is synonymized with M. tyrrhenica.\nWe also provide a checklist of all taxa belonging to Myrianida.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrianida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2841.phy"},{"tree_label":"One of two MPT","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myrianida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2840.phy"}]}
