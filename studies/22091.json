The genus\nhas been the subject of recent taxonomic analyses and includes four\ndescribed species and seven candidate species referred to here as\nPhyllopezus pollicaris sensu lato. In Paraguay, Phyllopezus is known\nfrom the Chaco and Cerrado where it is abundant, and also from a small\nisolated population from a rocky hill formation named “Cordillera de Los\nAltos” (Los Altos mountain range). Here we analyzed genetic samples from\nacross its range, including new samples from Paraguay, using DNA\nbarcoding analysis of the mitochondrial 16S gene and phylogenetic\nanalyses using both Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. We found\ngenetic and morphological differences among geckos from the Los Altos\nmountain range and the remaining Phyllopezus populations. Using both\nmolecular and morphological evidence we describe a new Phyllopezus\nspecies, sister to P. przewalskii. Genetic differentiation among\ndescribed and putative Phyllopezus species is greater than their\nmorphological differences, which likely accounts for these cryptic taxa\nremaining undescribed for so long.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109605.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109595.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109599.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllodactylidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109591.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllodactylidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109598.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109592.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109594.phy"}]}
