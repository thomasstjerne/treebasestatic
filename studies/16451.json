All ABC transporters contain both an\nATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain, responsible for the binding and\nhydrolysis of ATP, and a transmembrane domain, determining solute\nspecificity. We investigated the evolutionary pattern of ABC\ntransporters similar to AtWBC19 (ABCG19), an ABC transporter known to\nconfer resistance to kanamycin in Arabidopsis thaliana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ABC transporters homologous to AtWBC19","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_78097.phy"}]}
