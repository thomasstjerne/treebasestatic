In a survey of soil fungal\ndiversity in Yunnan, PR China, a novel taxon, Exophiala similis sp.\nnov., was identified using combined morphology and phylogeny.\nMorphologically, this species is characterized by having torulose,\nseptate hyphae, and swollen, terminal or intercalary conidiogenous cells\narising at acute angles from aerial hyphae. Phylogenetic analysis of the\ncombined sequences of the internal transcribed spacer, the small and\nlarge nuclear ribosomal RNA subunit and the partial Î²-tubulin gene\nconfirmed its new species status within the genus Exophiala.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exophiala","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134220.phy"}]}
