The new genus is\ncharacteriazed by hyaline to dark brown immersed to erumpent coriaceous\nascomata, persistent asci with apical thickening, pore and cytoplasmic\nretraction below the ascus apex and unicellular or bi-celled ascospore\nwith or without ephemeral, amorphous polar appendages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. x","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gesasha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26236.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geisasha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26235.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geisasha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26234.phy"}]}
