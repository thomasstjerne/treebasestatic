Fourteen species of agarics are new\nreports from Puducherry. The species Chlorophyllum rhacodes,\nLactocollybia epia, Leucoagaricus meleagris and Schizophyllum commune\nwere widely distributed. Phylogenetic relationships of the abundant\nspecies C. rhacodes, L. epia and L. meleagris were inferred by Maximum\nLikelihood method.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyllum rhacodes ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126235.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus meleagris ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126237.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactocollybia epia ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126236.phy"}]}
