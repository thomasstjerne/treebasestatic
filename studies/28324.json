The species is especially common in\nopen vegetation, including urban environments. Hypotrachyna\nisidiociliata sp. nov. is morphologically and chemically similar to H.\nhorrescens. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses of the nuITS and mtSSU\nregions revealed that H. isidiociliata is a distinct species and closely\nrelated to the North American H. mcmulliniana, differing by the size of\nits laciniae and ascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131402.phy"}]}
