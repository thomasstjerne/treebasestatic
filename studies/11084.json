However, few studies have\nexplored the generic relationships within Eriogonoideae. Two\nunderstudied genera are Triplaris and Ruprechtia (tribe Triplarideae), a\ngroup of approximately 55 Neotropical species of trees, shrubs and\nlianas. The generic classification of Triplaris and Ruprechtia has been\nunstable mostly due to different taxonomic interpretations and the\ndifficulty of characterizing each genus morphologically. Although some\nstudies have proposed diagnostic morphological characters for each, most\nhave exceptions. In this study, we explored the phylogenetic\nrelationships of 32 species of Triplaris and Ruprechtia using four\nchloroplast (matK, ndhF, rps16-trnK, ndhC-trnV), and two nuclear regions\n(ITS, second intron of Leafy). Results confirm the monophyly of\nTriplaris, but Ruprechtia is polyphyletic. To maintain monophyletic\ngenera, two new names are proposed: Magoniella and Salta. The two new\ngenera are formally described and morphological synapomorphies are\nproposed for the four genera of Triplaridae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triplaris and Ruprechtia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26270.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triplaris and Ruprechtia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26269.phy"}]}
