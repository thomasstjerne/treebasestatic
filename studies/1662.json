We examine the age and\nbiogeography of gypsophily in Tiquilia subg. Eddya, a Chihuahuan Desert\nplant group entirely composed of gypsophiles (restricted to gypsum) and\ngypsovags (growing on and off gypsum). A strongly supported phylogeny of\nthe subgenus was generated using sequence data from matK, ndhF, rps16,\nITS, and waxy. Combined analyses of these data suggest that the most\nrecent common ancestor of subg. Eddya was a gypsovag and that gypsophily\nhas evolved twice. Individual DNA sequence region analyses that include\na broad geographic sampling of all species in the subgenus reveal a\ncomplex evolutionary history shared among the narrowly distributed\ngypsophiles T. tuberculata and T. turneri and the gypsovags T. gossypina\nand T. mexicana, including putative hybridization. They also reveal a\nhigh level of geographically correlated intraspecific variation in the\nwidespread gypsophile T. hispidissima. Gypsophily is inferred to have\nbeen present in subg. Eddya by the early Pliocene. The concordance of\nthe biogeographic patterns of gypsophily in subg. Eddya with that of\nother Chihuahuan Desert gypsophiles suggests that a broad\nphylogeographic pattern may be shared among many gypsophilic plant\ngroups in this region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rps16, Tgossypina clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4668.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS, Tgossypina clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4669.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"waxy, Tgossypina clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"rps16, Thispidissima clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS, Thispidissima clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"waxy, Thispidissima.clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4673.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3markers, Thispidissima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tiquilia subg.
