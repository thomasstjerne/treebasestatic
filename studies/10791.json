The evolution of such gene families,\nwhich often undergo complex histories and different rates of change,\ncombined with increases in sequence data, pose complex problems for\ntraditional phylogenetic analyses, and in particular, those that aim to\nsuccessfully recover species relationships from gene trees. Here we\nimplement gene tree parsimony analyses on multi-copy gene family\ndatasets of snake venom proteins for two separate groups of taxa,\nincorporating Bayesian posterior distributions as a rigorous strategy to\naccount for the uncertainty present in gene trees. Bayesian gGene tree\nparsimony largely failed to infer species trees congruent with each\nother or with species phylogenies derived from mitochondrial and nuclear\nsequences. Analysis of four toxin gene families from a large expressed\nsequence tag dataset from the viper genus Echis failed to produce a\nconsistent topology, and re-analysis of a previously published gene tree\nparsimony dataset, from the family Elapidae, suggested that species tree\ntopologies were predominantly unsupported. We suggest that gene tree\nparsimony failure in the family Elapidae is likely the result of unequal\nand/or incomplete sampling of paralogous genes, and demonstrate that\nmultiple parallel gene losses are likely responsible for the significant\nspecies tree conflict observed in the genus Echis. These results\nhighlight the potential for gene tree parsimony analyses to be\nundermined by rapidly evolving multi-locus gene families under strong\nnatural selection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"C-type lectin AA","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21094.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVMP AA","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21130.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVMP DNA","ntax":"209","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21139.phy"},{"tree_label":"C-type lectin DNA","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21097.phy"},{"tree_label":"Echis PLA2 AA","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Elapid NXS","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21140.phy"},{"tree_label":"serine protease AA","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Echis PLA2 DNA","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21105.phy"},{"tree_label":"serine protease DNA","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Elapid PLA2","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elapidae venom","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21141.phy"}]}
