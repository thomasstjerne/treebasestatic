A cladistic analysis was performed to test the\nmonophyly of Adelobotrys, discover its synapomorphies, and clarify its\ninternal relationships. The results also allowed a preliminary appraisal\nof generic limits within Merianieae. For the analysis, 117 morphological\ncharacters were coded for 53 ingroup taxa (52 of Adelobotrys plus\nSarmentaria decora) and 12 outgroup species from the genera Meriania,\nGraffenrieda, Axinaea, Centronia, Phainantha, Behuria, Huberia,\nPachyloma, and Pternandra. The analysis resulted in a single most\nparsimonious tree. The result suggests that Adelobotrys is polyphyletic.\nHowever, species that fall within the original circumscription of the\ngenus form a well-supported monophyletic group. This group of lianoid\nspecies with narrow hypanthia; 5-locular ovaries; short fruiting\npedicels; urceolate to globose fruiting hypanthia; elongated, winged\nseeds; and a vestiture of malpighian hairs is here termed Adelobotrys\nsensu stricto. Several well-defined lineages are recognized within\nAdelobotrys s.s., although most of them have only weak support.\nPurported problems with circumscriptions of merianean genera, in\nparticular Meriania, gained support.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4-5","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adelobotrys and Merianieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4104.phy"}]}
