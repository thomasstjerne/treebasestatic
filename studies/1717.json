Brunneocorticium pyriforme, a corticioid\nfungal new genus and new species belonging to the euagarics clade, is\nproposed in this study. This new taxon has been collected from\nsubtropical-tropical Taiwan and southern Yunnan Province of China. Its\nbasidiocarps were quite often found on bark of living Murraya spp.\n(Rutaceae). The collections without good fertile parts were frequently\nencountered. Brunneocorticium pyriforme has resupinate basidiocarp and\nsmooth hymenial surface. It has dimitic hyphal system, with\nnodose-septate generative hyphae and abundant yellowish brown skeletal\nhyphae. Leptocystidia are occasionally present. Its basidia are\n2-sterigmate and basidiospores are pear-shaped. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on sequence data derived from LSU rDNA indicated that taxonomic\nplacement of Brunneocorticium is in the euagarics clade of\nHomobasidiomycetes, and is closely related to the agaricoid genera like\nMarasmiellus, Campanella etc. This molecular analysis also supports\nindependent status of Brunneocorticium, from other corticioid genera\nwith similar morphological features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brunneocorticium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4752.phy"}]}
