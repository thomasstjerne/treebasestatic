This study aims at documenting the\ndiversity of Trametes species in Benin (tropical Africa) and their\nphylogenetic positions with a focus on the T. elegans species complex.\nTherefore, we collected specimens of Trametes from different forest\ntypes across Benin. To infer phylogenetic relationships between Trametes\nspecies, we investigated sequences of five gene regions and added\navailable sequences from GenBank. Using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nphylogeny inference methods, we found eight supported species clades.\nFor the T. elegans species complex, we reestablish the name Trametes\npalisotii for species previously known as T. elegans in tropical Africa.\nFurther, we propose Trametes parvispora as a species new to science and\nprovide the description of this species. Our molecular phylogeny of\nTrametes with a focus on tropical Benin contributes to taxonomic clarity\nof an important wood-decay fungal genus, which is the basis for\nbiodiversity assessments of Trametes in the tropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML phylogeny of Trametes spp. based on the two gene\n(ITS-LSU) dataset with combined branch support values given as\nPP/BS.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_118686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.S1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML phylogeny of Trametes spp. based on a single gene\n(ITS) dataset.
