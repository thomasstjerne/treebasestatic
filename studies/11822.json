This section is\ntaxonomically important because the genus Volvox is polyphyletic.\nHowever, taxonomic studies of species in Volvox sect. Volvox have not\nbeen carried out since 1944. Here we performed a taxonomic study of\nmonoecious species of Volvox sect. Volvox based on the comparative\nmorphology and molecular phylogeny of chloroplast genes and the internal\ntranscribed spacer regions (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) using\nvarious strains originating from Japan and two preserved strains from\nUSA. The strains were clearly divided into four species, V. globator L.,\nV. barberi W. Shaw, V. kirkiorum Nozaki et al. sp. nov. and V. ferrisii\nN. Isaka et al. sp. nov., on the basis of differences in numbers of\nzygotes (eggs) in the sexual spheroids, form of zygote wall and somatic\ncell shape. Sequences for ITS of nuclear rDNA resolved that the two new\nspecies have phylogenetic positions separated from V. globator, V.\nbarberi, V. capensis F. Rich et Pocock and V. rousseletii G. S. West\nwithin Volvox sect. Volvox.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox sect.
