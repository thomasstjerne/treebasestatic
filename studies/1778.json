Accessions from western North America, Europe, Central\nAmerica, the Caribbean, and Australia are compared. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of the 25S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregions demonstrates that Tubaria is not monophyletic. However, the\nautonomy of six brown-spored, saprotrophic species\u001aNaucoria vinicolor,\nPholiota serrulata, Phaeomarasmius confragosus, Pholiota punicea,\nTubaria rufofulva, and T. bispora sp. nov.\u001ais affirmed. All six species\nform a strongly supported monophyletic group that we label section\nConfragosae in the genus Tubaria. This section is related to T.\ndispersa, T. albostipitata, and numerous representatives of the T.\nfurfuracea complex. Tubaria minima is related to other lineages of\ndark-spored Agaricales. Taxonomic descriptions, illustrations, and a key\nto confirmed species of section Confragosae are provided. Four new\ncombinations are proposed and one new species, T. bispora, is described\nas new from Costa Rica and Martinique.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayes 105 25S","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MAP Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_341.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule Tubaria ITS 25S","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined ITS_25S 50% majority rule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_519.phy"}]}
