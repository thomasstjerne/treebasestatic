A lectotype\nand epitype for U. notabile on A. dealbata are proposed in this study in\norder to stabilise the taxonomy of this group of rust fungi. A combined\nmorphological and molecular approach showed that U. notabile has a wide\nhost range as it was found on six Acacia species namely, A. dealbata, A.\ndecurrens, A. elata, A. mearnsii, A. penninervis and A. rubida.\nDifferences in morphology, host species and DNA sequence data of four\ngene regions from the Small Subunit, the Internal transcribed Spacer and\nthe Large Subunit regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA, as well as the\nmitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 showed that Uromycladium sp.\nO represented a new species on A. trudgeniana in Western Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90387.phy"}]}
