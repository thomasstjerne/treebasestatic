Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian\nInference sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS)\nand large subunit (LSU) of the ribosomal DNA barcodes allowed assessing\nthe phylogenetic relationships of the new species with other species of\nthe respective genera. Heliocephala variabilis sp. nov. was closely\nrelated to Heliocephala elegans, Heliocephala gracilis, and Heliocephala\nzimbabweensis, from which it was morphologically distinguished by its\nsmaller conidiophores and non-rostrate conidia of up to four septa on\nthe natural substratum. Pseudopenidiella vietnamensis sp. nov. was\nrelated to Pseudopenidiella piceae and Pseudopenidiella podocarpi and\ndiffered from the former principally by its lack of microcondiophores\nand from P. podocarpi by having larger macroconidiophores and smooth\nconidia. Key morphological features to distinguish the accepted species\nin Heliocephala and Pseudopenidiella are also provided. In addition,\nPseudopenidiella pini was excluded from the genus on the basis of its\nmorphological features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microthyriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130891.phy"}]}
