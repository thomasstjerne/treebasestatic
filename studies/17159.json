This disease was initially reported in Belize and now is\ndistributed in the humid tropics of the Americas, with severe outbreaks\noccurring in the citrus crops in Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Caribbean\nislands, Mexico and the USA. Although Colletotrichum acutatum s.lat. and\nC. gloeosporioides s.lat. cause PFD, the first species is more\nimportant, because it is responsible for approximately 80 % of the cases\nin Brazil (Lima et al. 2011). Several cryptic species have been proposed\nwithin the C. acutatum complex based on the analysis of DNA sequence\ndata (Damm et al. 2012a). However, the accurate identification of the\ncausal agent of the PFD has not been performed by molecular data. The\nstrains obtained from symptomatic plants were distinguished from other\nColletotrichum species based on a multilocus phylogenetic tree of six\ngenes (alignment and tree were deposited into TreeBASE under accession\nnumber 17159). Colletotrichum abscissum is phylogenetically close but\nclearly distinct from C. costaricense. In addition, the new species\ndiffers from C. costaricense by its shorter and narrower conidia.\nMolecular comparisons show that the sequences obtained in this study\nhave 100 % identity with the ITS (GenBank EU168901) and GAPDH (GenBank\nEU168905) sequences from isolate ALB-IND-25, previously identified as C.\nacutatum (Peres et al. 2008). Among the 16 species of Colletotrichum\nreported on Citrus spp., only C. citri, C. godetiae, C. johnstonii and\nC. limetticola belong to the C. acutatum species complex (Damm et\nal. 2012a, Huang et al. 2013). All these taxa are morphologically and\nphylogenetically distinct from C. abscissum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum spp. TUB2, ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3,\nACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88385.phy"}]}
