Early work indicated that the secondary\nstigmas provide a mechanism of autogamy suggesting that it may ensure\nreproductive assurance. Here, we test the monophyly of this unique\nmorphological trait. Using Bayesian methods, we infer a nuclear DNA\nphylogeny for 96 accessions, including ca. 50% of the species from the\ngenus Sebaea. With this phylogeny, we infer the distribution of\nancestral states on critical nodes using parsimony and likelihood\nmethods. The inferred nrDNA phylogeny shows that the genus Sebaea is\ndivided in two statistically well supported clades, A and B, consistent\nwith recent estimates. The most recent ancestor (MRCA) of clade A,\nexcept the most basal species (S. pusilla), is resolved as\ndiplostigmatic. No reversal to a single stigma is observed within this\nclade. We suggest that diplostigmaty is evolutionarily stable through\ntime. We also discuss why this reproductive system is not found\nelsewhere than in Gentianaceae and the potential advantage of\ndiplostigmaty as a stable mixed mating strategy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayes Maj Rule Con","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6559.phy"}]}
