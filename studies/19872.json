sequence data in Daucus, (2) the\nconcordance among various subsets of the plastid data, (3) the\nconcordance to nuclear DNA sequence data, and (4) the concordance to\ncurrently known mitochondrial DNA transfer to the plastid (DcMP), in\nwild and cultivated carrot, Daucus species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP phylogram of Daucus
