Some medical compounds such as taxol are produced\nby endophytic fungi. Spinifex littoreus is an important coastal grass\nfor stabilizing and protecting coastal areas and it has been shown to\nhave anti-inflammatory properties, however, little is known about the\norganisms associated with this plant. In this study, a new species of\nNeostagonospora was found by combining culture-dependent,\nculture-independent and opportunistic collection approaches. Based on\nmolecular data from the ITS and RPB2 markers and on morphological data,\nthe species differed from other Neostagonospora species. Neostagonospora\nspinificis is proposed as a new species. The shape of conidiogenous\ncells as well as numbers of septa and size of conidia are useful\ncharacters for distinguishing Neostagonospora species. A key to the\nknown species of Neostagonospora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neostagonospora RPB2 NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89101.phy"}]}
