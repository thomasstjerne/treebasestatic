Most biologists\nwould assume that this character should provide better phylogenetic\ninformation than, say, the spatial distribution of these species over a\nfairly continuous 500-km radius area. Paradoxically, this is not the\ncase among terrestrial snail genera in the clausiliid subfamily\nAlopiinae. Phylogenetic analysis using the nuclear markers ITS1/ITS2 and\nmitochondrial markers COI/12S reveals widespread homoplasy in the\nclausilial apparatus (a complex aperture-closing mechanism), and\nconcomitant extensive polyphyly among Carinigera, Isabellaria, and\nSericata. In contrast, phylogenetic relationships as revealed by\nmolecular data are closely congruent with biogeography at a relatively\nsmall scale. A combination of extremely low vagility and extremely high\nmorphological convergence has conspired to produce this unexpected\nresult. Implications as to the function of the clausilial apparatus are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Appendix C (b)","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"50% Majrule tree from Bayesian analysis 12S plus\nCOI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1821.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix C (a)","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"50% Majrule tree from Bayesian analysis ITS1&2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"50% Majrule tree from Bayesian analysis combined\nmatrices","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2027.phy"}]}
