This second paper focuses on 20 genera of\nphytopathogenic fungi: Allantophomopsiella, Apoharknessia,\nCylindrocladiella, Diaporthe, Dichotomophthora, Gaeumannomyces,\nHarknessia, Huntiella, Macgarvieomyces, Metulocladosporiella,\nMicrodochium, Oculimacula, Paraphoma, Phaeoacremonium, Phyllosticta,\nProxypiricularia, Pyricularia, Stenocarpella, Utrechtiana and\nWojnowiciellas. Moreover, this study includes one new genus, 20 new\nspecies, five new combinations, and six typifications of older\nnames.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Result","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paraphoma ITS-TEF-TUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116439.phy"}]}
