The\ndata matrix (2Z taxa by 118 characters) was analyzed using the WAGNER\noption of the PHYLIP computer program. Six equally parsimonious\nminimum-length Wagner networks are discerned and rooted to form six\nWagner trees. Incongruities among the Wagner trees must await resolution\nthrough the acquisition of additional characters. The computed Wagner\ntrees are more parsimonious than the existing phylogenies of Ricker\n(1952), Illies (1965), Zwick (1980), and Brodskiy (1982). I show that\nthe phylogenies of Zwick and Brodskiy are more congruent with the\ncomputer-generated Wagner trees than are those of Ricker and Illies.\nHowever, the analyses of the latter two workers are in accord with the\nWagner trees in depicting the Eusthenioidea as the sister group to that\ntaxon comprising the Gripopteryoidea; Scopuridae, Nemouroidea, and\nSystellognatha.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1523.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2E","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1519.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1520.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1521.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1522.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2F","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plecoptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1525.phy"}]}
