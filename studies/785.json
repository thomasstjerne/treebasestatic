The new species\nChionosphaera cuniculicola differs morphologically from C. apobasidialis\nby the more slender basidiospores in the former species. The segregation\nof the two species is supported by comparison of partial sequences of\nthe large subunit of the ribosomal gene. Isotype material of\nChionosphaera lichenicola was re-examined. In contrast to C.\ncuniculicola and C. apobasidialis, C. lichenicola exhibits clamps at the\nsepta. Fibulostilbum phylacicola is considered as a clamp-bearing\nspecies of Chionosphaera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chionosphaera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3893.phy"}]}
