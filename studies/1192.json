Relatively high levels of pox\ntranscript were detected under carbon-starved culture conditions but not\nunder nutrient-sufficiency. This regulation pattern is similar to that\nobserved for lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases and glyoxal\noxidase of P. chrysosporium, supporting evidence that POX has a role in\nlignocellulose degradation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyranose 2-oxidase from Phanerochaete\nchrysosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4394.phy"}]}
