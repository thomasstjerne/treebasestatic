Worldwide-distributed subgenus Plantago is taxonomically\ncomplex group with high rates of polyploid. Our molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses with a nuclear-encoding single-copy gene SUC1 (1.2â€“1.8 kb)\nrevealed allopolyploidy in two common polyploids (tetraploid P. asiatica\nvar. densiuscula and hexaploid P. formosana) distributed in Japan. Then\nwe investigated 24 taxa representing all five sections of the subgenus\nPlantago and two taxa from subgenus Coronopus as the outgroup. Fifteen\nknown polyploids and one putative polyploid, ranging from tetraploid to\ndodecaploid, were analyzed to examine occurrence of reticulate evolution\namong subgenus Plantago. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by\nmaximum parsimony, neighbor-joining, and Bayesian analyses. For the\nfirst time, our analysis provides a well-resolved phylogenetic tree of\nsubgenus Plantago. Our analyses clearly indicated highly reticulate\nnature of subgenus Plantago. In addition, our data suggested the\npossibility of two independent long-distance dispersals from the\nNorthern Hemisphere to Southern Hemisphere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plantago","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6574.phy"}]}
