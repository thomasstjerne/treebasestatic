Tyrosinases, tyrosinase-related proteins,\ncatechol oxidases and hemocyanins comprise the type-3 copper protein\nfamily and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including\npigment formation, innate immunity and oxygen transport, via the binding\nof dioxygen. This family is present in the three domains of life,\nhowever previous studies have largely focussed on specific metazoan and\nplant lineages and the origin and early evolution of the family is not\nwell understood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootstrap
