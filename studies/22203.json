A combination of genomic,\nenzymatic, and metabolomic analyses of a deeply branching\nchemolithotrophic Thermosulfidibacter takaii ABI70S6T revealed a\nreversible TCA cycle whose direction was controlled by the available\ncarbon source(s). Under a chemolithoautotrophic condition, a rTCA cycle\noccurred with the reverse reaction of citrate synthase (CS) and not with\nthe adenosine 5 ́-triphosphatedependent citrate cleavage reactions that\nhad been regarded as essential for the conventional rTCA cycle.\nPhylometabolic evaluation suggests that the TCA cycle with reversible CS\nmay represent an ancestral mode of the rTCA cycle and raises the\npossibilities of a chemolithomixotrophic origin of life.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI tree","ntax":"223","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109748.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"223","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109747.phy"}]}
