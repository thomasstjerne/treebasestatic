When such divergence involves ecologically\nequivalent populations existing within a small, environmentally\nhomogeneous area, an important role for non-environmental divergence is\noften found or inferred1,4. Here we show that microgeographic\ndifferentiation may involve unexpected small-scale local adaptation. We\nstudied a species complex of Plectostoma snails on scattered limestone\noutcrops in a 10\u001a35 km area of lowland rainforest in Borneo. A striking\ngeographic divergence in shell morphology is associated with both\nneutral genetic divergence and behavioural differentiation in the snails\u001a\ninvertebrate predator. We also offer a model for the evolution of\nreproductive isolation as a result of this process of shell evolution.\nOur study suggests that fine-scaled analysis of insular systems may\nreveal a greater role for environmental adaptation in allopatric\ndivergence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Opisthostoma concinnum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_733.phy"}]}
