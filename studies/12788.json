Two species are transferred to Tassadia\nas T. richardiana and T. stricta. One species, M. eggersii, is retrieved\nas a member of subtribe Gonolobinae rather than Metastelmatinae, and\nseveral South American species fall within the “Stelmation” clade\ntogether with species of Ditassa. In Metastelma sensu stricto, the South\nAmerican species are not monophyletic, falling into a M. tubatum Clade\nand a South American-Caribbean M. parviflorum Clade. Most Caribbean\nspecies, except for M. anegadense, M. decipiens, M. lineare, and M.\nparviflorum, form a clade in which the Cuban species are sister to the\nremaining taxa. The Central American mainland species show a clear\ngeographical structure with a center of diversity in central Mexico, two\nradiations along the Occidental portion of Sierra Madre, and one\nradiation along the Oriental portion of Sierra Madre. Biogeographic\nanalyses suggest that South America was the source for multiple\ninvasions to the Caribbean. The genus possibly reached Central America\nvia the Caribbean and the Yucata´n peninsula, rather than the Panamanian\nland bridge, although further studies are needed to bolster this\nhypothesis. Several morphologically similar but geographically isolated\ntaxa, interpreted previously as varieties and subspecies of the same\nspecies, are shown to be polyphyletic. As a result, Metastelma arenicola\nis raised to species rank, while M. trichophyllum, M. macropodum and M.\nchiapense are re-established as independent species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS2 ML bootstrap consensus","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS2 ML bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58997.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS1 ML best tree","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS1 ML best tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58991.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS1 Bayesian tree","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS1 Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS1 ML bootstrap consensus","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS1 ML bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS1 MP bootstrap consensus","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS1 MP bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58989.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS1 MP strict consensus","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS1 MP strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58988.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS2 Bayesian majority rule consensus","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS2 Bayesian majority rule consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS2 ML best tree","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS2 ML best tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS2 MP strict consensus","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS2 MP strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Metastelma DS2 MP bootstrap consensus","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metastelma DS2 MP bootstrap consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58994.phy"}]}
