In the Orient, an\neconomically important fungus commonly known as ¡®ling-zhi¡¯ or\n¡®chi-zhi¡¯ for more than 2000 years, has also been named G. lucidum.\nHowever, the identity of the Oriental fungus has been questioned in\nrecent years. Earlier molecular studies suggested that G. lucidum sensu\nstricto may be restricted to Europe, and ¡®G. lucidum¡¯ in Asia consists\nof at least two distinct species, one represented by material from\nmainland China and one by tropical Asian collections. This study\nattempts to clarify the identity of ¡®G. lucidum¡¯ in tropical Asia,\nwith special emphasis on wild collections from Taiwan. The internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) of\nrelated species and strains were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses\nwere conducted. The results confirmed that G. lucidum is a mistakenly\napplied name to Oriental collections. The forgotten name Ganoderma\nmultipileum presented over half a century ago from Taiwan, was found in\nthis study as the earliest valid name for ¡®G. lucidum¡¯ known from\ntropical Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma multipileum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6190.phy"}]}
