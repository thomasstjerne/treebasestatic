The species is remarkable by the\nlarge basidiomata with shallow orange yellow umbilicus, long central\nstipe accompanied by similar long rhizomorphs on thickened basal\nmycelium and large lacrymiform to sigmoid basidiospores.\nMacroscopically, the coarsely plicate pilei with lilac, violet to dark\nviolaceous tints, and large distant adnate lamellae are reminiscent of\nthe tropical African species M. bekolacongoli. The phylogenetic\nrelationship among M. mbalmayoensis and M. bekolacongoli was assessed,\nextended to other species of sects. Globulares and Sicci based on DNA\nsequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on nuc-LSU rDNA sequence data of\nselected marasmioid taxa using parsimony and Bayesian analysis supported\nthe placement of M. mbalmayoensis in Marasmius, well distinct from M.\nbekolacongoli, and suggested its monophyly with Amyloflagellula inflata.\nThe findings also indicated the complexity of M. bekolacongoli.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 maj rule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marasmius mbalmayoensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3056.phy"}]}
