All too often cpDNA\nand nrDNA ITS are insufficiently variable to provide desired resolution.\nIn the present study, we have adopted a RAPD-based approach to develop\nsequence-characterized regions, from the nuclear genome, with levels of\nDNA sequence variation appropriate for resolving relationships within\nsubclades of Leucaena (Fabaceae). RAPDs were used to amplify a set of\nseven Leucaena accessions. Equal length fragments amplified in two or\nmore species were sequenced and compared. Specific primers were designed\nfor aligned product sets displaying similar or greater levels of\nvariation than have been found in previous ITS studies. Two regions\nwhose DNA sequences provided greater resolution and bootstrap support\nthan ITS or cpDNA RFLP restriction site data sets for the same sample of\nLeucaena species are discussed in detail.","trees":[{"tree_label":"cpDNA tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucaena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1247.phy"},{"tree_label":"a9 tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucaena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1248.phy"},{"tree_label":"23L tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucaena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1245.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucaena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1246.phy"}]}
