Recent molecular studies on marine\nnematodes indicated cryptic diversity and strong genetic differentiation\nof distinct populations, but for freshwater nematode species analogous\nstudies are lacking. Here, we present the first extensive molecular\nstudy exploring cryptic species diversity and genetic population\nstructure of a widespread freshwater nematode morphospecies, Tobrilus\ngracilis, from nine post-glacially formed European lakes. Taxonomic\nspecies status of individuals, analysed for fragments of the\nmitochondrial COI-gene and of the large (LSU) and small (SSU) ribosomal\nsubunits, were determined by morphological characteristics.\nMitochondrial and nuclear markers strongly supported the existence of\nthree distinct genetic lineages (Tg Iâ“III) within Tobrilus gracilis,\nsuggesting that this morphospecies indeed represents a complex of highly\ndifferentiated biological species. High genetic diversity was also\nobserved at the population level. Across the nine lakes, 19\nmitochondrial, seven (LSU), and four (SSU) nuclear haplotypes were\ndetermined. A phylogeographic analysis revealed remarkable genetic\ndifferentiation even among neighbouring lake populations for one cryptic\nlineage. Priority and persistent founder effects are possible\nexplanations for the observed population structure in the post-glacially\noccupied lakes, but ask for future studies providing direct estimates of\nfreshwater nematode dispersal rates. Our study suggests therefore that\noverall diversity of limnetic nematodes has been so far drastically\nunderestimated and challenges the assumed ubiquitous distribution of\nother, single freshwater nematode morphospecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the COI gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the SSU gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the SSU gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the LSU gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63814.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the LSU gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tobrilus gracilis: Bayesian phylogenies of Tobrilus\ngracilis based on the COI gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_63812.phy"}]}
