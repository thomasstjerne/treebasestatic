In the current study, strawberry plants displaying\nroot rot symptoms were collected in Beijing, China, during 2018 and\n2019. Eight representative isolates were isolated from the symptomatic\nroots. Based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis of combined the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, β-tubulin and transcription\nelongation factor 1-α (tef1) region all of our isolates were identified\nas Neopestalotiopsis rosae, and its pathogenicity was confirmed. This is\nthe first report of N. rosae causing root rot disease on\nstrawberry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopestalotiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125083.phy"}]}
