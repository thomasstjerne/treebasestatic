Many mammals\nincluding ruminants, the most diversified ungulate suborder, evolved\nhighcrowned (hypsodont) teeth as an adaptation to toothwearing diets and\nhabitats. The impact of different causes of tooth wear is still a matter\nof debate, and the temporal pattern of hypsodonty evolution in relation\nto the evolution of grasslands remains unclear. We present an improved\ntimecalibrated molecular phylogeny of Cetartiodactyla, with phylogenetic\nreconstruction of ancestral ruminant diets and habitats, based on\ncharacteristics of extant taxa. Using this timeline, as well as the\nfossil record of grasslands, we conduct phylogenetic comparative\nanalyses showing that hypsodonty in ruminants evolved as an adaptation\nto both diet and habitat. Our results demonstrate a slow, perhaps\nconstrained, evolution of hypsodonty towards estimated optimal states,\nexcluding the possibility of immediate adaptation. This augments recent\nfindings that slow adaptation is not uncommon on millionyear time\nscales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"184","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetartiodactyla grr al. combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105486.phy"}]}
