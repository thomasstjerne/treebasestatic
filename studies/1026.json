Taxonomy and illustrations of\nthese species are provided along with a key to these and similar species\nfound in Europe and North America. The species concept of I. chelanensis\nis broadened to include the range of variation occurring for the species\nin North America. Despite different basidiospore morphologies, I.\nchelanensis is more closely related to I. stellatospora, and I.\ncandidipes is more closely related to I. glabrodisca based on RPB1 and\nnLSU-rDNA nucleotide sequences. Distal elongation of Inocybe\nbasidiospores was achieved independently in at least two separate\nlineages of Inocybe. Inocybe candidipes and I. sierraensis are described\nas new.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe chelanensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1232.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe chelanensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1233.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe chelanensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1234.phy"}]}
