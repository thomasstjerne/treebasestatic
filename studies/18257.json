Reports of\nPseudomonas syringae pvs. lachrymans, aptata, syringae, savastanoi, and\ntabaci as cucurbit pathogens indicates that a broader diversity of\norganisms within P. syringae may be responsible for this disease than\npreviously recognized. In this study we collected 27 P. syringae strains\nover several years from watermelon, cantaloupe, and squash hosts in\nFlorida, Georgia, and California. Strains were fluorescent on KingÂ’s\nmedium B agar and displayed the typical phenotypic and biochemical\ncharacteristics of P. syringae. Phylogenetic analysis using four\nhousekeeping genes (gyrB, rpoD, gapA, gltA) indicated that P. syringae\nstrains infecting cucurbits were distributed among three clades within\ngenomospecies 1 (phylogroup 2a, 2b, and 2d), and were phylogenetically\ndistinct from P. syringae pv. lachrymans which is in genomospecies 2 (P.\namygdali). One strain recovered from cantaloupe was found to be a member\nof genomospecies 2, and displayed limited host range and virulence. The\nidentification of identical multilocus haplotypes recovered from\nFlorida, Georgia, and California over multiple years suggests the\npotential dispersion of the pathogen through seed. Pathogenicity tests\nshow that watermelon, squash, and cantaloupe are susceptible to\ngenetically diverse P. syringae strains in genomospecies 1.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90498","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90498.phy"}]}
