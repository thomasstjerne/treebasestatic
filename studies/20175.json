In order to establish the basis for a natural classification\nof Ganodermataceae, morphological analyses, including scanning electron\nmicroscopy, as well as a molecular phylogenetic approach based on the\nInternal Transcribed Spacer and the Large Subunit of the nuclear\nribosomal DNA were carried out with specimens of this family.\nUltrastructural analyses raised up a new character for Ganodermataceae\nsystematics, i.e.Â is the presence of perforation in the exosporium with\nholes that are connected with hollow columns of the endosporium. This\ncharacter is considered as a synapomorphy in Foraminisporus, a new genus\nproposed here to accommodate Amauroderma sprucei. Furtadoa is proposed\nto accommodate species with monomitic context: F. brasiliense, F.\ncorneri and F. biseptata. Molecular phylogenetic analyses confirm that\nboth genera grouped as strongly supported distinct lineages out of\nAmauroderma s.s. clade. Therefore, a proposal for a phylogenetic\napproach of Ganodermataceae is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99735.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99736","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99736.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99783.phy"}]}
