Four genera are placed in the\nfamily: Chorioactis, Desmazierella, Neournula and Wolfina. Based on\nparsimony, likelihood and Bayesian analyses of LSU, SSU and RPB2\nsequence data Chorioactidaceae represents a sister clade to the\nSarcosomataceae, to which some of these taxa were previously referred.\nMorphologically these genera are similar in pigmentation, excipular\nconstruction, and asci, which mostly have terminal opercula and rounded,\nsometimes forked, bases. Ascospores have cyanophilic walls or\ncyanophilic surface ornamentation in the form of ridges or warts. So far\nas is known the ascospores and the cells of the paraphyses of all\nspecies are multinucleate. The six species recognized in these four\ngenera all have limited geographical distributions in the northern\nhemisphere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chorioactidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5008.phy"}]}
