These new species are distinguished from\ntheir congeners by unique features of the sclerotised structures of the\ncopulatory organ, in particular of the aculeus, swollen proximally in O.\nnorenburgi sp. nov., and lanceolate in shape in O. didomenicoi sp. nov.\nSpecimens of the latter species were also found in South Portugal.\nCanarian and Portuguese specimens show poor genetic distinction based on\nthe markers used, hinting to a remarkable dispersal power for a\nmesopsammic organism. New information is given on the ‘accessory male\ncanal’, a putative autapomorphy for the genus Otoplana. Its functions\nand connections with genital systems are discussed, in the light of new\ndata on molecular phylogeny of the family Otoplanidae presented. The\nMediterranean specimens of Otoplana sequenced, morphologically\nattributed to O. truncaspina, O. bosporana, O. falcataspina and O.\nlabronica, did not show genetic distinction, urging for a\nreconsideration of the status of the Mediterranean taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Proseriata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109779.phy"}]}
