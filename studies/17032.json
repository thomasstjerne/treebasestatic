It\ncontains two species of which one, Chayamaritia smitinandii (B.L.Burtt)\nD.J.Middleton, was formerly placed in the genera Chirita and Henckelia.\nThe other, Chayamaritia banksiae D.J.Middleton, is newly described. The\nexclusion of Chayamaritia smitinandii from Henckelia further clarifies\nthe taxonomic and biogeographic limits of Henckelia following its\nconsiderable recircumscription during the recent remodelling and\nsynonymisation of Chirita.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"234","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81402.phy"}]}
