The anatomy of the\nascomata and their ontogeny was studied and was found to be uniform\nwithin the family and fitting well into the scheme observed in the genus\nLecanora. rDNA ITS genes were sequenced from two species of the\nCandelariaceae and analysed by maximum parsimony together with 11\nLecanora sequences, one Protoparmelia sequence, and two sequences from\nthe Parmeliaceae. A strict consensus of seven most-parsimonious trees\nshows that the two species of Candelariaceae form a monophyletic group\nnested within the Lecanoraceae. Based on anatomical and molecular\nevidence, the Candelariaceae is proposed to belong within the\nLecanoraceae, and should not be regarded as a separate family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 29","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Candelariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3516.phy"}]}
