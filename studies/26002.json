Members of\nthis genus are commonly found on dead leaves and woody debris on the\nfloor of tropical and subtropical forests. Recent studies suggest\nchanges in the circumscription of Tetrapyrgos and Campanella Still\npoorly documented, to date, only about 18 species have been assigned to\nTetrapyrgos. Through integrative taxonomy, we describe six new species\nfrom the Brazilian Amazon, based on evidence from morphological and ITS\ndata. Tetrapyrgos longicystidiata is formally synonymized in T.\natrocyanea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetrapyrgos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129109.phy"}]}
