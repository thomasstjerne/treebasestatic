Moraceae exhibit a complex array of\ninflorescence architectures, breeding systems, and pollination\nsyndromes, which forms the basis of traditional taxonomic\nclassification. However, morphologically based classification conflicts\nwith evolutionary relationships proposed by molecular phylogenetics. In\nthis study we assembled a morphological character matrix for analysis\nseparately and in combination with existing molecular data. We evaluated\n81 vegetative, reproductive, and wood anatomical characters for 94\nspecies representing nearly all Moraceae genera. Using parsimony and\nBayesian methods, these characters were evaluated with respect to ndhF\nchloroplast and 26S nuclear DNA sequences. Topological comparisons\ntested whether opposing classification schemes are more or less\nsupported by the data. Results did not support any classification of\nMoraceae based on morphology. We present a revised tribal classification\nand describe a new tribe, Maclureae, two subtribes of Castilleae,\nCastillineae and Antiaropsineae, and reinstate the genera Malaisia\n(including Malaisia scandens) and Sloetia (including Sloetia elongata).\nLastly we discuss the evolution of inflorescence architecture in\nrelation to other floral features.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3u","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, MP Unconstrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5442.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, MP Constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5443.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4u","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, BI Unconstrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5444.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4c","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, BI Constrained","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5445.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5m","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, 26S and ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5446.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5c","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5447.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraceae, partitioned BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5448.phy"}]}
