Sp1 is characterized by\nround to angular pores (56 per mm), weakly dextrinoid skeletal and\nbinding hyphae and big basidiospores (5.57.5 × 1.82.2 μm). Neofomitella\nsp2 is characterized by white pore surface when fresh, dextrinoid\nskeletal and binding hyphae, orange red context near pileal surface when\nfresh. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS), the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the\nsmall subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit\nmitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-α\ngene (EF1-α), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) and the\nsecond largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2), confirmed affinity\nwith the Neofomitella species. An identification key to Neofomitella is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114793.phy"}]}
