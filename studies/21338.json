Since morphological characters are inadequate to define\nspecies in Diaporthe, DNA sequence data are essential to differentiate\nthem. We therefore focus this paper on the 171 species for which\nex-type/ex-epitype/ex-isotype/ex-neotype isolates and corresponding\nmolecular data are available and these species are listed\nalphabetically. Existence of sexual or asexual morph are noted under\neach species, detailed descriptions of type materials, host records and\ngeographic distribution are provided. Available DNA sequence data from\nex-type cultures are listed in Table 1. Phylogenetic relationships of\nthe species are given in a multi-locus phylogenetic tree based on\ncombined ITS, tef1-α, β-tubulin and CAL sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"257","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107866.phy"}]}
