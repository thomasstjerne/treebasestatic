Uncinula on Carpinus spp.\nwas reconstructed using the 28S rDNA sequences and a combined alignment\nof the 28S, ITS, and IGS ribosomal DNA sequences. The analysis was\nsupplemented with morphological data obtained from examination of\nvoucher specimens. A sequence of E. sect. Uncinula on Carpinus cordata\nformed a distinct lineage separated from sequences of other Erysiphe\nspecies on Carpinus spp., indicating a cryptic species, which is\ndescribed as Erysiphe paracarpinicola. The new species is genetically as\nwell as morphologically most similar to E. carpinicola s. str., but\ndiffers in having fewer asci per chasmothecium (mainly 35) and shorter\nchasmothecial appendages. A key to species of Erysiphe sect. Uncinula on\nCarpinus spp. is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107155.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107154.phy"}]}
