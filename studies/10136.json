The results showed that this group\nof strains is included within a cluster of numerous endophytic,\npantropical xylariaceous isolates lacking both defined teleomorph and\ntaxonomic status, together with Hypoxylon species from tropical origin\nthat comprises both H. investiens and H. kanchanapisekii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Actin","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nodulisporium sp. producers of nodulisporic acid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6158.phy"},{"tree_label":"Beta Tubulin","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nodulisporium sp. producers of nodulisporic acid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6312.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nodulisporium sp. producers of nodulisporic acid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6256.phy"}]}
