Perenniporia pseudotephropora is characterized by the\nperennial and pileate basidiocarps with distinctly stratified tubes; a\ndimitic hyphal system with slightly dextrinoid arboriform skeletal\nhyphae; globose, truncate, weakly dextrinoid, cyanophilous basidiospores\nmeasuring 4.95.2 × 44.8 μm. The morphological similar species and\nphylogenetically closely related species to two new species are\ndiscussed. An identification key to the species of Perenniporia that are\neasily confused with two new species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
