Both\nspecies belong in section Bryoria, which was resolved as a polyphyletic\ngroup in the ITS+Mcm7 phylogeny. Bryoria alaskana belongs to a clade\nrestricted to southeast Asia and northwest North America and is so far\nknown from southeast Alaska and the Sino-Himalayan Mountains. This\nhighly variable species is most reliably recognized by its pendent,\nesorediate thallus, production of fumarprotocetraric acid, and\ncombination of isotomic branching, abundant, whitish, predominantly\nfusiform pseudocyphellae, and sparse short perpendicular side branches.\nBlack emorient patches are lacking. Bryoria irwinii is endemic to\nnorthwest North America and closely related to B. araucana from South\nAmerica, B. poeltii from southeast Asia, as well as B. nadvornikiana and\nB. trichodes, both widely distributed in the northern hemisphere. It is\na subpendent, esorediate species recognized by its predominantly\nanisotomic branching, olivaceous hue, black emorient patches,\nconspicuous pale brownish, fusiform pseudocyphellae, and numerous\nperpendicular, more or less basally constricted side branches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95362","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95362.phy"}]}
