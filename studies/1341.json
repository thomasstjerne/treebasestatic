Euglypta and Miltitzia, previously hypothesized\nbased on seed characters and ecological distribution. Tree branching\npatterns within the Euglypta/Miltitzia clade indicate three principle\nlineages: 1) the P. pachyphylla complex, 2) a clade of P. brachyloba and\n3) a clade consisting of two sister groups, the P. affinis complex and\nthe P. fremontii complex. An aneuploid increase in chromosome number\noccurs from the P. pachyphylla complex (n = 11) to P. brachyloba (n =\n12) while the pattern within the P. fremontii complex includes both\naneuploid increases and decreases. There is high bootstrap support for\nmonophyly of taxa representing both the P. magellanica polyploid complex\nand the P. humiles species group; the former contains the only known\ntetraploid taxa in subgenus Phacelia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phacelia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2126.phy"}]}
