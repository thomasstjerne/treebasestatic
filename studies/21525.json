The delineation of this family is rather problematic\nbecause the characters of ascostromata are extremely variable and the\nnames of taxa with sequence data are often misleading. In this paper,\nspecies of Diatrypaceae were collected from Para rubber in northern\nThailand for examination and illustrations. Based on morphological\ncharacteristics and phylogenetic analyses, a new genus, Allocryptovalsa,\nis introduced to accommodate a new species A. polyspora and two species,\nA. cryptovalsoidea and A. rabenhorstii are transferred to the new genus.\nThe new species, Diatrypella heveae and Peroneutypa longiasca are also\nintroduced in this paper. Phylogenetic analyses of combined ITS and\nÎ²-tubulin sequence data show their phylogenetic affinities in\nDiatrypaceae. Our study also shows that phylogenetic analyses of taxa of\nDiatrypaceae are highly confused as some genera are shown to be\npolyphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106783.phy"}]}
