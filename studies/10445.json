Most Neotyphodium species analyzed so far are\ninterspecific hybrids, with combined or partial genomes of two or three\nancestors. In this study, we characterized Neotyphodium endophytes from\nCinna arundinacea, a perennial cool season grass from eastern North\nAmerica. A total of 23 isolates grouping into two distinct morphotypes\nwere obtained from five local populations of C. arundinacea. PCR and\ncloning of translation-elongation factor 1-α (tefA) and beta-tubulin\n(tubB) genes of ten isolates comprising both morphotypes (two isolates\nlocation-1) revealed that all ten contain two copies of tef1 and tub2\ngenes. Surprisingly, phylogenetic analysis of mainly non-coding regions\nfrom these genes revealed that both copies of each isolate were\ninherited from Epichloë typhina ancestors, suggesting the C. arundinacea\nendophytes arose through intra-specific hybridization between two E.\ntyphina isolates from hosts Poa nemoralis and Poa pratensis. Profiling\nof alkaloid biosynthetic genes from these isolates suggests the presence\nof the peramine biosynthetic gene (perA) and the absence of genes\nrequired for biosynthesis of ergot alkaloid, lolines and lolitrems.\nThus, this endophyte is potentially capable of producing peramine in\nplanta and providing protection to its host from insect pests. The\nabsence of genes for ergot and lolitrem alkaloid biosynthesis makes this\nendophyte a candidate for agricultural applications. Based on the\nphylogeny, alkaloid profiling and morphological characteristics, these\nisolates from C. arundinacea are now named as Neotyphodium schardlii, a\nnew member of genus Neotyphodium and the first described to have arisen\nthrough an intraspecific hybridization event.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Intra-specific Neotyphodium hybrid in Stout
