This new section is recovered\nsister to section Lamprocroton in Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood\nanalyses of nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-F DNA sequence data. Croton\nbreedlovei, a new lepidote species of section Pedicellatus endemic to\nChiapas, Mexico is described. The two Mexican members of section\nPedicellatus, C. breedlovei and C. tenuilobus, are not recovered sister\nto each other in the phylogenetic analyses, possibly indicating two\nseparate dispersal events from South America. This result is\ncorroborated by the morphological evidence given that C. breedlovei is\nphylogenetically closer to other lepidote species from Brazil than it is\nto the stellate C. tenuilobus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Croton section Pedicellatus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7851.phy"}]}
