Two collections of Phialosporostilbe from China and Thailand are\nidentified and introduced as a new species named P. scutiformis with the\nfirst sequence data for the genus. A new genus Neonawawia is introduced\nto accommodate Ne. malaysiana. New combinations are proposed for the\ngenera Neonawawia and Phialosporostilbe. Descriptions and illustrations\nof the new taxa and identified species are provided. Reference specimens\nof Cryptophiale udagawae, Cryptophialoidea fasciculata and Nawawia\nfiliformis are designated in this study. Phylogenetic placements of the\ngenera Cryptophiale, Cryptophialoidea, Nawawia, Neonawawia and\nPhialosporostilbe are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeriales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113435.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeriales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113434.phy"}]}
