This phylogeny is\ncongruent with previous phenetic analyses of morphometric data for the\nlice. Comparison with a previously obtained phylogeny for the hosts\nindicates some degree of cospeciation. These cospeciation events are\nused to compare relative rates of evolution in the birds and their lice\nfor the same segment of the cytochrome b gene. Cytochrome b is evolving\n2-3 times more rapidly in lice than in birds, and louse cytochrome b is\nhighly divergent compared to most other insects. Although generation\ntime has been suggested as an explanation for the disparity in\nevolutionary rates between lice and their hosts, we suggest that the\nsmall effective population sizes of lice coupled with founder events\noccurring during transmission to new host individuals may be an\nimportant factor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8 nj","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dennyus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3444.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8 ml","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dennyus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3445.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8 parsimony","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dennyus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3443.phy"}]}
