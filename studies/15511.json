Manzanita\nbears apple-like fruit that is utilised for a range of edible products.\nOver the past two years, several foliar disease problems were noted on\nthis host in the San José de Gracia region of Mexico. The aim of the\npresent study was to elucidate their identity through the analysis of\nmorphological characters and DNA phylogeny (based on the large subunit\nnuclear ribosomal RNA gene and the ITS spacers and the intervening 5.8S\nrRNA gene of the nrDNA operon) of the fungi associated with these\ndisease symptoms. Three species are newly described: Phaeococcomyces\nmexicanus sp. nov., a presumed epiphyte, and two species associated with\nleaf spots and defoliation, namely Coccomyces arctostaphyloides sp. nov.\nand Passalora arctostaphyli sp. nov. A fourth species is also associated\nwith leaf spots and tip dieback is Harknessia arctostaphyli, for which\nan epitype is designated. All species can co-occur on the same shrub,\nwhich adds to the stress experienced by the plant, leading to further\ndefoliation and dieback.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Foliicolous fungi from Arctostaphylos pungens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71686.phy"}]}
