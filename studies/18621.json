The present study of more than 100 species, based on Bayesian and\nmaximum likelihood analysis of five chloroplast and four nuclear\nmarkers, resolves nine clades. No unambiguous morphological characters\nare associated with any particular clade or a combination of several\nclades, so that a wide concept of Cynanchum seems the most appropriate\ntaxonomic solution for the group. For this reason, several hitherto\nindependent genera, Glossonema, Graphistemma, Holostemma, Metalepis,\nMetaplexis, Odontanthera, Pentarrhinum, Raphistemma and Seshagiria are\nincluded in Cynanchum. In addition, Adelostemma and Sichuania are\nsubsumed under Cynanchum for morphological reasons. The necessary new\ncombinations are made, resulting in twelve new species combinations, two\nnew subspecies combinations, and two new names.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 majrule","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92299.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92300.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92302.phy"}]}
