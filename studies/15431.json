Garganicae is\nillustrated and described. Morphologically and phylogenetically it is\nwell differentiated from other species of this series. It is\nmorphologically similar to C. portenschlagiana from Central Dalmatia\n(Croatia) based on corolla shape. Phylogenetic analyses, maximum\nparsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference, based on nuclear\nITS and chloroplast trnLtrnF data support C. skanderbegii as a clearly\ndistinct taxon within the isophyllous species of Campanula. A\ndistribution map for C. skanderbegii and a key to all species of\nCampanula ser. Garganicae are provided. Because of its rarity and highly\nrestricted distribution, C. skanderbegii should be included in the IUCN\nred list as a critically endangered species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanula skanderbegii trnLF ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70685.phy"}]}
