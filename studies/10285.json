These species share a\npileate basidiome, small basidiospores, and an absence of setae. The\ncritical morphological features that differentiate them are the pileus\nhabit or shape, pore surface color, pore diameter, and possibly their\necology. Each new species forms distinct but closely related clades in\nphylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from nuclear ribosomal LSU, ITS,\nand translation elongation factor 1-Î±, considered either individually or\nconcatenated. This, along with the occurrence of other species in\nsub-Saharan Africa and their phylogenetic relationships, are briefly\ndiscussed. A key to six species of Fomitiporia from sub-Saharan Africa\nis also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia in sub-Saharan Africa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6869.phy"}]}
