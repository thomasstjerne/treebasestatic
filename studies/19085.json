Previous comparisons of the chloroplast genome\nfrom nine streptophyte algae (including four zygnematophyceans) revealed\nthat, although land plant chloroplast DNAs (cpDNAs) inherited most of\ntheir highly conserved structural features from green algal ancestors,\nconsiderable cpDNA changes took place during the evolution of the\nZygnematophyceae, the sister group of land plants. To gain deeper\ninsights into the evolutionary dynamics of the chloroplast genome in\nstreptophyte algae, we sequenced the cpDNAs of nine additional taxa: two\nklebsormidiophyceans (Entransia fimbriata and Klebsormidium sp. SAG\n51.86), one coleocheatophycean (Coleochaete scutata) and six\nzygnematophyceans (Cylindrocystis brebissonii, Netrium digitus, Roya\nobtusa, Spirogyra maxima, Cosmarium botrytis and Closterium baillyanum).\nOur comparative analyses of these genomes with their streptophyte algal\ncounterparts indicate that the large inverted repeat (IR) encoding the\nrDNA operon experienced loss or expansion/contraction in all three\nsampled classes and that genes were extensively shuffled in both the\nKlebsormidiophyceae and Zygnematophyceae. The klebsormidiophycean\ngenomes boast greatly expanded IRs, with the Entransia 60,590-bp IR\nbeing the largest known among green algae. The 206,025-bp Entransia\ncpDNA, which is one of the largest genome among streptopytes, encodes\n118 standard genes, i.e.Â four additional genes compared to its\nKlebsormidium flaccidum homolog. We inferred that seven of the 21 group\nII introns usually found in land plants were already present in the\ncommon ancestor of the Klebsormidiophyceae and its sister lineages. At\n107,236 bp and with 117 standard genes, the Coleochaete IR-less genome\nis both the smallest and most compact among the streptophyte algal\ncpDNAs analyzed thus far; it lacks eight genes relative to its\nChaetosphaeridium globosum homolog, four of which represent unique\nevents in the evolutionary scenario of gene losses we reconstructed for\nstreptophyte algae. The ten examined zygnematophycean cpDNAs display\ntremendous variations at all levels, except gene content. During\nzygnematophycean evolution, the IR disappeared a minimum of five times,\nthe rDNA operon was broken at four distinct sites, group II introns were\nlost on at least 43 occasions, and putative foreign genes, mainly of\nphage/viral origin, were gained.","trees":[{"tree_label":"dS","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95082.phy"},{"tree_label":"dN","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95081.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG12 RAxML GTR+G4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95078.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG-AA RAxML GTR+G4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95079.phy"},{"tree_label":"dN/dS","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95083.phy"},{"tree_label":"PCG-AA PhyloBayes CATGTR+G4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Streptophyte Green Algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95080.phy"}]}
