Ten\nstations from the Svalbard archipelago (7380 °N, 1831 °E) were\ninvestigated and 33 fungal isolates were obtained. These grouped into 22\noperational taxonomic units (OTUs) using nuc rDNA internal transcribed\nspacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) with acut-off set at 98%\nsimilarity. The taxonomic analysis showed that 17 OTUs belonged to\nAscomycota, one to Basidiomycota, two to Mucoromycota and two were\nfungal-like organisms. The nuc rDNA V1-V5 regions of 18S (18S) and D1-D3\nregions of 28S (28S) were sequenced from representative isolates of each\nOTU for comparison to GenBank sequences. Isolates of Lulworthiales and\nEurotiales were the most abundant, with seven isolates each. Among the\n22 OTUs, nine represent potentially undescribed species based on low\nsimilarity to GenBank sequences and 10 isolates showed inhibitory\nactivity against Gram-positive bacteria in an agar diffusion plug assay.\nThese results show promise for the Arctic region as asource of novel\nmarine fungi with the ability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites\nwith antibacterial properties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MB-LSU con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB-LSU","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117083.phy"},{"tree_label":"MRbayes SSU con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB-SSU","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117081.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes.Multilocus.50majContree","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MrBayes.Multilocus.Contree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117072.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxMLtree","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RAxML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117073.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes.nopartition.50majcontree","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MrBayes.nopartition.50majcontree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Suboptimal Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117074.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB-ITS con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MB-ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117082.phy"}]}
