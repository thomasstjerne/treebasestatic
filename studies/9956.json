Phylogenetic trees based on the\nLSU and ITS regions detected three main clades among the Echinochaete\ncollections used in this study. The morphology of the type specimen E.\nrussiceps falls within the range of those in one of the detected clade,\nand we concluded that this name represents the clade. Echinochaete\nrussiceps is characterized by aculeate to lanceolate setoid elements\nwith lateral spines on the pileus surface, but was found to have\nvariable pore size and pileus surface colour. Another detected clade was\nrepresented by E. brachypora. The morphology of the specimens in the\nresidual clade is clearly distinct from the other known species in\nEchinochaete and we described it as E. maximipora sp. nov. This species\nis characterized by the larger and elongated pores [(1)2 4 (0.5)1 2 mm],\ncylindrical setoid elements with lateral spines on the pileus surface\nand the narrower basidiospores. We provide detailed descriptions of\nEchinochaete species in Asia and an identification key to the species of\nEchinochaete.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Echinochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6070.phy"}]}
