We performed separate phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear rDNA\nlarge subunit (28S) region and the complete nuclear rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer region (ITS) to establish the placement of the new\nspecies in the phylogeny of the Agaricaceae. This new species has a\nmacromorphology similar to that of Lc. birnbaumii, but the spore print\nis light brown. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the macro-\nand microscopic characters are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucocoprinus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucocoprinus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130987.phy"}]}
