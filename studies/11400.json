The genus comprises 17\nspecies, of which 16 are endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South\nAfrica and one extends eastwards to southern KwaZulu-Natal.\nMorphological, cytological and chemical character variations are briefly\ndiscussed. A cladistic analysis of 19 morphological characters and one\nchemical character resulted in a partially resolved topology with two\nmain clades. These two groups are described as sections, namely Villosae\nand Podalyria. Two new species are described: P. leipoldtii and P.\nvariabilis. Historically, the application of names in Podalyria has been\nhighly variable and unreliable, so that considerable effort was required\nto unravel the intricate nomenclature, synonymy and typification of the\nspecies. This revision (the first since 1862) also includes full\ndescriptions, diagnostic characters, photographs, illustrations and\ndistribution maps. The Red Data List status of five of the threatened\nspecies is given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43774.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43773.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43772.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43771.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43775.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podalyria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43776.phy"}]}
