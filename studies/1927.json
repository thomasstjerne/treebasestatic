A recently published molecular phylogeny of bumble bees\nprovides uniquely comprehensive species sampling for exploring\nhistorical patterns of distribution and diversification. Using this\nphylogeny and detailed data on extant distributions, I reconstruct the\nhistorical distribution of bumble bees in a temporal framework,\nestimating divergence times using fossil data and molecular rates\nderived from the literature. The nearly comprehensive phylogeny allows\nassessment of the tempo of diversification within the bumble bees using\nlineage-through-time plots and diversification statistics, which have\nbeen performed with special consideration to confidence intervals. These\nanalyses reveal movements of Bombus concordant with geographic and\nclimatic events of the late Cenozoic. The initial diversification of\nextant bumble bee lineages was estimated at around 25 ˆ 40 Ma, near the\nEocene-Oligocene boundary 34 Ma, a period of dramatic global cooling.\nDispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) predicted an Old World Bombus\nancestor, with early diversification events largely restricted to the\neastern Old World. The numerous intercontinental dispersal events\noccurred mostly in the direction of Old World to New World and North\nAmerica to South America. Early movements from the Palearctic into the\nNearctic most likely took place after 20 Ma, and may have coincided with\na period of Miocene cooling that gave rise to taiga habitat across\nBeringia. Subsequent dispersal between these regions is estimated to\nhave occurred among boreal and tundra-adapted species mostly in the last\n5 million years. Radiations are estimated in both Nearctic and\nNeotropical regions at ~6 ˆ 8 Ma and after 3.5 Ma, concordant with the\nopening of land corridors between the continents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Comp no gaps","ntax":"229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2906.phy"},{"tree_label":"reduced no 16S","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_354.phy"},{"tree_label":"red ArgK","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2900.phy"},{"tree_label":"reduced opsin","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2902.phy"},{"tree_label":"reduced 16S","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2904.phy"},{"tree_label":"red5gen","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2905.phy"},{"tree_label":"reduced PEPCK","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2901.phy"},{"tree_label":"reduced EF1a","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2903.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2-4","ntax":"229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bumble Bees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2907.phy"}]}
