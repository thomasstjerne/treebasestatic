The\nfungus had been documented several times in the past in Japan, but with\nno definitive description. Description is given based on voucher\nspecimen. The sequence of D1D2 region of nuclear large subunit of\nribosomal DNA (LSU) obtained from the isolate was identical to European\nand American specimens. Maximum parsimony analysis incorporating all\navailable ITS-5.8S sequences of R. subterranea resulted in two groups.\nOne composed of the isolates from Vitis spp. in Germany while the other\ncomposed of isolates from various deciduous trees in various countries.\nThe Japanese isolate was incorporated to the latter group, suggesting\nthat the host selectivity was more effective in evolution of R.\nsubterranea than geographical distance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48505.phy"}]}
