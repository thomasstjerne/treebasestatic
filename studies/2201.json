Species in this genus have been described mainly on the\nbasis of host association, and to a lesser extent on their\nmicromorphology. However, studies have revealed that host association is\nof minor taxonomic importance, due to the wide host ranges of some\nspecies. Moreover, more than one species can occur on a single host. On\nthe other hand, morphological characters are not always suitable for\nspecies definition because of their plasticity and overlap between\ndifferent species. Foeniculum vulgare is an herbaceous plant known to\nharbour a complex of Diaporthe and Phomopsis species. In this study,\nthis complex is resolved and several taxa are delineated. An intensive\nsampling of Diaporthe species and Phomopsis anamorphs found on F.\nvulgare in Portugal was done and a collection of isolates was\nestablished in culture. Isolates were characterised and grouped\naccording to their microsatellite-primed PCR (MSP-PCR) profiles.\nRepresentative isolates were subsequently selected for a molecular\nphylogeny based on the rDNA ITS region (ITS1\u001a5.8S\u001aITS2). Combining\nmorphological, cultural and molecular data, four species were\ndistinguished from F. vulgare. Diaporthe angelicae is proved to be the\nmost common pathogen of this host in Portugal. Diaporthe lusitanicae is\nnewly described, whereas the teleomorph of Phomopsis theicola was shown\nto be distinct from Diaporthe theicola, and is described as Diaporthe\nneotheicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5400.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5401.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5402.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5403.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5404.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5405.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5406.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5407.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5408.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5409.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe on Foeniculum vulgare","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5410.phy"}]}
