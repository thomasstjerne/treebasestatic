However, partial\ncytochrome b sequences were of little phylogenetic value in this study.\nA suite of pairwise comparisons between taxa revealed that at the\nintergeneric level, the cytochrome b gene is saturated at synonymous\ncoding positions due to multiple substitution events. Furthermore,\nvariation at the nonsynonymous positions is limited, rendering the\ncytochrome b gene of little phylogenetic value for assessing the\nrelationships between leporid genera. If the cytochrome b data were\nanalyzed without accounting for these two classes of nucleotides (i.e.,\nsynonymous and nonsynonymous sites), one may incorrectly conclude that\nsignal exists in the cytochrome b data. The mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene,\non the other hand, has not experienced excessive saturation at either\nstem or loop positions. Phylogenies reconstructed from the 12S rDNA data\nsupport hypotheses based on fossil evidence that the African rock\nrabbits (Pronolagus) are outside of the main leporid stock and that\nleporids experienced a rapid radiation. However, the molecular data\nsuggest this radiation event occurred in the mid-Miocene several\nmillions of years earlier that the Pleistocene dates suggested by\npaleontological evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leporidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3438.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leporidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3439.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leporidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3440.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leporidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3441.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leporidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3442.phy"}]}
