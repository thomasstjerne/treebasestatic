Location Worldwide, with an emphasis on the northern\nhemisphere. Methods A phylogeny of euapioids was inferred from 1194\nnrDNA ITS sequences using Bayesian methods. The reconstruction of\nancestral areas was performed simultaneously with phylogeny calibration\nusing a Markov discrete phylogeographical model with Bayesian stochastic\nsearch variable selection (BSSVS). Routes with significant non-zero\nmigration rates were identified with Bayes factor test. For each\nsignificant track and each tree, the distribution of dispersals in time\nwas scored and the asymmetry of dispersals was evaluated. Results The\nroot of the euapioid umbellifers was reconstructed at ca. 44.51 Ma (95%\nHPD 39.11-51.55). The Eastern Asiatic Region was reconstructed as the\nmost probable ancestral area for the root of the tree; however, western\nEurasia and the Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian Regions were also\nincluded in this 95% confidence interval. Seventeen migration routes\nhave significant non-zero migration rates. Twelve of these tracks\nrepresent inland dispersals, mostly within the Old World, or those\nacross continental shelf seas. The long-distance transoceanic routes\ninclude: (1) western Eurasia-North America, (2) Eastern Asiatic\nRegion-North America, (3) Australia-Neotropical Kingdom, (4)\nAustralia-Neantarctic, and (5) Neotropical Kingdom-sub-Saharan Africa.\nMost dispersal events occurred among the areas that comprise the major\ndiversification centres of apioid umbellifers: western Eurasia and the\nMediterranean, Irano-Turanian, and Eastern Asian Regions. The floristic\nexchange among these regions was more or less symmetric in all\ndirections and continuous in time. The exchange between North America\nand the Eastern Asiatic Region was asymmetric; the asymmetry of\ndispersals between western Eurasia and North America was less pronounced\nand not statistically significant. Floristic exchange was significantly\nasymmetric for the Nearctic-Neotropical Kingdom, Nearctic-Neantarctic,\nwestern Eurasia-sub-Saharan Africa, and western Eurasia-Siberia\nmigration tracks. Main conclusions The observed dispersal\npatternï¿½intense and symmetric within the same climatic zone versus\nscarce and often unidirectional between climatic zones or along\nlong-distance transoceanic tracksï¿½suggests that both geographical\nbarriers and the availability of suitable habitats have played crucial\nroles in determining the present distribution of euapioid\numbellifers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c MCC tree","ntax":"1194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Maximum Clade Credibility tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57239.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c MCC tree Anno","ntax":"1194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Maximum Clade Credibility Tree with annotations\n(download original file)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57261.phy"}]}
