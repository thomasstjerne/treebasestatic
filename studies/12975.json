However, the parental lineages of the largest group of\nallotetraploids, Nicotiana section Suaveolentes, have been problematic\nto identify. Using data from four regions of three low-copy nuclear\ngenes, nuclear ribosomal DNA and regions of the plastid genome, we have\nreconstructed the evolutionary origin of sect. Suaveolentes and\nidentified the most likely diploid progenitors by using a combination of\ngene trees and network approaches to uncover the most strongly supported\nevidence of species relationships. Our analyses best support a scenario\nwhere a member of the sect. Sylvestres lineage acted as the paternal\nprogenitor and a member of either sect. Petunioides or sect. Noctiflorae\nthat also contained introgressed DNA from the other, or a hypothetical\nhybrid species between these two sections, was the maternal progenitor.\nNicotiana exemplifies many of the factors that can complicate the\nreconstruction of polyploidy evolutionary history and highlights how\nreticulate evolution at the diploid level can add even greater\ncomplexity to allopolyploid genomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GS 5 alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55093.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LFY FLO alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55087.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LFY FLO alignment diploids and all polyploids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55089.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ADH alignment diploids and all polyploids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55088.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GS 3 alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55091.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ADH alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55090.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55092.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plastid alignment diploids and sect Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55094.phy"}]}
