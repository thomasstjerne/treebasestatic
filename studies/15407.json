This endophytic life style can last through the entire speciesÂ’\nlife cycle or can be expressed only during a portion of it, leaving\ntheir host for reproduction and dispersal purposes. The objective of\nthis study was to identify a group of unknown endophytic fungal isolates\nisolated from the living sapwood of wild and planted Hevea (rubber tree)\npopulations. Three novel lineages belonging to the genus Tolypocladium\nare described based on molecular and morphological data. Their ecology\nand potential application in biocontrol of diseases in rubber\nplantations are discussed. Findings from this study open a window for\nnovel hypotheses, not only in the ecology and role of endophytes within\nplant communities, but also on trait evolution and potential forces\ndriving diversification of Cordyceps-like fungi. This study stresses the\nimportance of integrating the asexual and sexual fungal states, for a\nmore complete understanding of the natural history of this diverse\ngroup. In addition, it highlights the study of fungi in the sapwood of\ntropical trees as habitat for the discovery of novel fungal lineages and\nsubstrate associations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gen.20000000","ntax":"195","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 10000 trees","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70735.phy"}]}
