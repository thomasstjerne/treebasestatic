Greatly variable phenotypic characteristics\nand large-scale phylogenies have led to frequent changes in the\ntaxonomic circumscription of this order over the time. Ostropales sensu\nlato is currently split into Graphidales, Gyalectales, Odontotrematales,\nOstropales sensu stricto and Thelenellales. Ostropales sensu stricto is\nnow confined to the family Stictidaceae, which includes a large number\nof species that are poorly known, since they usually have small fruiting\nbodies that are rarely collected, and thus their taxonomy remains partly\nunresolved. Here we introduce a new genus Ostropomyces to accommodate a\nnovel lineage related to Ostropa, composed of two new species, as well\nas a new species of Sphaeropezia, S. shangrilaensis. Maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian inference analyses of mtSSU, LSU and ITS sequence data,\ntogether with phenotypic data documented by detailed illustrations,\nsupport the taxonomic affinity of the new taxa in Stictidaceae.\nAncestral character state analysis did not resolve the ancestral\nnutritional status of Stictidaceae with confidence using Bayes traits,\nbut a saprotrophic ancestor was indicated as most likely in a Bayesian\nbinary MCMC approach. Frequent switching in nutritional modes between\nlineages suggests that lifestyle transition plays an important role in\nthe evolution of this family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131440.phy"}]}
