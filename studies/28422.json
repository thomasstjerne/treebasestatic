To identify the pathogen, molecular and morphological\nidentification data of the total four isolates were obtained and a\nmultiple-gene phylogenetic tree was built based on three genes ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS), Plasma membrane ATPase (ATP) and\nCalmodulin (CAL). KochÂ’s postulates were fulfilled with the\nisolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria tenuissima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135245.phy"}]}
