Micheli ex F.H. Wigg is one of the best\nknown lineages of hypogeous ascomycetes. It is currently thought to be\nformed of at least 9-11 clades and more than 180 different species\n(Bonito et al., 2010b; Kinoshita et al., 2011). However, many\ntaxonomical problems still exist. One of them deals with the often\nconfused species Tuber gennadii, T. asa and T. oligospermum, all of them\noccurring in the Mediterranean basin. The purpose of the current study\nis to obtain morphological, ecological and molecular data of new\ncollections of these species to ascertain their most probable\nphylogenetic relationships. To this end, these species were compared\nwith some others frequently found in the same or similar habitats of the\nMediterranean basin, such as Tuber borchii and T. puberulum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55517.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55516.phy"}]}
