Cultivation is severely limited due to a\nrange of fungal diseases, especially those caused by species of\nDiaporthe. A number of Diaporthe isolates have been collected from\nVaccinium growing regions in Europe, and initially identified as D.\nvaccinii based on host association. Using DNA sequence inference of the\ncombined Î²-tubulin, calmodulin, translation elongation factor 1-alpha\nand the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear rDNA, along\nwith morphological characteristics, six species were characterised.\nDiaporthe eres, D. vaccinii and D. viticola are known species and three\nnovel taxa are described here as D. asheicola, D. baccae and D.\nsterilis. This study is the first confirmed report of D. vaccinii in\nLatvia and the Netherlands.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ITS, tub2, cmdA and tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69580.phy"}]}
