In recent years,\nthe taxonomy of Northern Hemisphere Armillaria spp. has been extensively\ntreated, but those occurring in Africa are poorly known. Previously,\nisolates of Armillaria from Zimbabwe have been grouped based on\nmorphology and biochemical tests. In this study, six isolates\nrepresenting the three previously characterised groups of Armillaria\nspp. occurring in Zimbabwe were analysed using DNA-based techniques.\nThree distinct clusters emerged from both PCR-RFLP and analysis of\nsequence data for the IGS-1 rRNA operon. The three groups corresponded\nto those previously identified based on morphology and biochemical\ntests. Differences in IGS-1 sequences strongly suggest that the\nZimbabwean groups represent three distinct taxa. Isolates belonging to\ngroup I, previously assumed to be to A. heimii were similar to those\nidentified as A. fuscipes from South Africa and La Reunion. Group II\nisolates resided in a clade apart from all other isolates and appear to\nrepresent A. heimii. The remaining isolates residing in Group III\nclustered with isolates from Zambia and Cameroon. These are different to\nA. heimii and A. fuscipes and apparently represent an undescribed\ntaxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_879.phy"}]}
