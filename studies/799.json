The internal and\nexternal transcribed spacers of 53 Medicago species sensu stricto and 10\nof the 23 medicagoid species were sequenced. Both maximum parsimony or\nmaximum likelihood criterion joined medicagoid species more confidently\nwith Medicago rather than with Trigonella. The basal position of the\nmedicagoid species within the genus Medicago, together with\nmorphologically atypical Medicago species (such as M. radiata and M.\nplatycarpa), raised the question of the expediency to define a new group\nand/or a new genus and is discussed, relatively to the support of each\nclade, based on morphological and molecular data. Using criteria of\nmonophyly and support, it was concluded that the medicagoids are better\njoined in Medicago rather than placed in a new genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Medicago","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3959.phy"}]}
