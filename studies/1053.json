The species concept\nof B. stevensii has been unclear, and it is possible that some\ncollections were incorrectly identified. A collection of fungal strains\nisolated from diseased oak trees and initially identified as B.\nstevensii was characterized on the basis of morphology and ITS\nnucleotide sequences. Morphology was compared with the type specimens of\nPhysalospora mutila (= B. stevensii) and its anamorph Diplodia mutila.\nIt was concluded that the isolates from oaks differed from B. stevensii\nin having larger ascospores and conidia as well as different spore\nshapes, and represented an as yet undescribed species, which is\ndescribed here as B. corticola. Moreover, ITS sequence data separated B.\ncorticola from all other known species of Botryosphaeria. Amended\ndescriptions of B. stevensii and its anamorph are provided to\ndifferentiate B. stevensii from B. corticola and to clarify some of the\nearlier taxonomic uncertainties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4207.phy"}]}
