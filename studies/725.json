Based on morphology and\nsexual compatibility, various species of Armillaria have been reported\nfrom Australia and New Zealand. These include A. hinnulea, A. fumosa, A.\npallidula, A. novae-zelandiae and A. luteobubalina from Australia. In\nNew Zealand, A. limonea, A. novae-zelandiae, A. hinnulea and a fourth\nundescribed but morphologically distinct species are recognized. To\ndetermine the phylogenetic relationships between Armillaria spp. from\nAustralia and New Zealand, the ITS region (ITS 1, 5.8S rRNA gene and\nITS2) of the rRNA operon was amplified and the DNA sequences determined\nfor a collection of isolates. The ITS sequences of A. ostoyae (from USA)\nand A. sinapina (from USA) were included for comparison. Phylogenetic\ntrees were generated using parsimony analysis. Armillaria hinnulea was\nfound to be more closely related to Armillaria spp. occurring in the\nNorthern Hemisphere than it was to the other Australian and New Zealand\nspecies. The remainder of the Australian and New Zealand Armillaria spp.\nincluded in this study formed a monophyletic clade and confirmed\nseparation of species based on morphology and sexual compatibility.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3791.phy"}]}
