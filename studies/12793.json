We performed maximum parsimony,\nmaximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses on 364 terminals: 11\noutgroup terminals and 353 ingroup Terrarana terminals, including 139\nIschnocnema terminals (accounting for 29 of the 35 named Ischnocnema\nspecies) and 214 other Terrarana terminals within the families\nBrachycephalidae, Ceuthomantidae, Craugastoridae, and\nEleutherodactylidae. Different optimality criteria produced similar\nresults and mostly recovered the currently accepted families and genera.\nAccording to these topologies, Ischnocnema is not a monophyletic group.\nWe propose new combinations for three species, relocating them to\nPristimantis, and render Eleutherodactylus bilineatus Bokermann, 1975\nincertae sedis status within Holoadeninae. The rearrangements in\nIschnocnema place it outside the northernmost Brazilian Atlantic\nrainforest, where the fauna of Terrarana comprises typical Amazonian\ngenera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"364","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ischnocnema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70730.phy"}]}
