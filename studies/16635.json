The\ncausative pathogens were classified as pteropine orthoreoviruses with a\nstrong phylogenetic relationship to orthoreoviruses of bat origin.\nResults: In this report, we isolated a novel Melaka-like reovirus (named\nâCangyuan virusâ) from intestinal content samples of one fruit bat\nresiding in Chinaâs Yunnan province. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole\nCangyuan virus genome sequences of segments L, M and S demonstrated the\ngenetic diversity of the Cangyuan virus. In contrast to the L and M\nsegments, the phylogenetic trees for the S segments of Cangyuan virus\ndemonstrated a greater degree of heterogeneity. Conclusions:\nPhylogenetic analysis indicated that the Cangyuan virus was a novel\northoreovirus and substantially different from currently known members\nof Pteropine orthoreovirus(PRV) species group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 23","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79468.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79469.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 20","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 23","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79471.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 21","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79472.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 18","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79466","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79466.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequence of\ntheL1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79465.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 22","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79467","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79467.phy"}]}
