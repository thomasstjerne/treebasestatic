We demonstrate\nthat the genera Julella and Arthopyrenia do not form monophyletic groups\nwith taxa from these genera appearing in Pleosporales and\nTrypetheliales. Within Dothideomycetes, lichen-forming species with\nbrown ascospores are generally placed in the genera Mycomicrothelia,\nArchitrypethelium, and Aptrootia in the family Trypetheliaceae. We\ntested the taxonomic placement of Anisomeridium phaeospermum, in\nMonoblastiaceae. This species produces brown-spores with wall\nornamentation and therefore appears morphologically similar to\nMycomicrothelia. Despite these morphological similarities, molecular\ndata indeed confirmed its placement in Anisomeridium. Consequently, the\ndistinction between these two genera is in need of clarification and\nascus characters are identified as the principal discriminating feature.\nFinally, we identify the non-lichenized taxa Heleiosa barbatula and\nFunbolia dimorpha as being part of the otherwise lichen-forming family\nMonoblastiaceae. This is confirmed by the perithecial anatomy of the\nsexually reproducing Heleiosa barbatula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52960.phy"}]}
