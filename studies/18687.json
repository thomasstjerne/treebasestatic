Phylogenetic analysis based on the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and nuclear large subunit\n(nLSU) ribosomal RNA gene regions indicated that the two new species\nwere nested within the Coltricia clade in Hymenochaetales. C.\naustrosinensis is characterized by centrally stipitate basidiocarps,\nlobed pileus mragin, distinctly swollen stipe tip, cinnamon pore\nsurface, large pores (13 per mm), broadly ellipsoid basidiospores\nmeasured as 8.29.8 × 5.56.5 µm, and having a distribution in subtropical\nChina so far. C. minima is characterized by mini, centrally stipitate\nbasidiocarps, entire pileus margin, uniform stipe, pileus bearing\ndistinct concentric zones and pore surface dark greyish blue when fresh,\nsmall pores (34 per mm), narrow tramal hyphae (3.54 µm), broadly\nellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measured as 67.2 × 4.25.2 µm, and\noccuring in mixed tropical forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coltricia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97549.phy"}]}
