The AFLP analysis divided the isolates into five\ngroups that correlated with taxonomic species and, in most cases, with\nhost origin. The only exception was a group consisting of A. candida\nisolates from both B. oleracea and C. bursa-pastoris. ITS1 sequence\nanalysis divided the isolates into the same five groups, demonstrated\nthe divergence between P. parasitica isolates from A. thaliana and B.\noleracea, and, using previously published ITS1 sequences, clearly showed\nthe relationship between A. candida isolates from different hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronosporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3638.phy"}]}
