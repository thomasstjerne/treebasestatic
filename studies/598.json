Compositional characteristics of the two gene regions\nare compared, and their contributions to a cladogram inferred from the\ncombined data set are assessed. Primarily due to its uniform base\ncomposition, wg appears to become saturated more slowly than mtDNA,\nalthough the two genes appear to be evolving at quite similar rates. We\nsuggest that wg will be a useful source of characters for phylogenetic\nstudies of butterflies, and perhaps other insect taxa, with divergence\ntimes up to 60 million years ago.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6 COII","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nymphalidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nymphalidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6 wg","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nymphalidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3551.phy"}]}
