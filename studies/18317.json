They are\nSpiromastigoides albida, from a lung biopsy in USA, characterized by\nwhite colonies and a malbranchea-like asexual morph with curved\nconidiophores; and Spiromastigoides sugiyamae, from soil in Japan,\nmorphologically very close to Spiromastigoides warcupii but with longer\nperidial appendages and a thallic asexual morph. In addition, the new\ncombination Spiromastigoides alatospora (Gymnoascus alatosporus) is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spiromastigoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91935.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 2","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spiromastigoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91936.phy"}]}
