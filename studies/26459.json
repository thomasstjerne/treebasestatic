Jennwenomyces navicularis is described\nand illustrated, based on two specimens collected on decaying culms of\nMiscanthus floridulus submerged in freshwater streams of Alishan area,\nChiayi County, Taiwan. Jennwenomyces produces dematiaceous,\nversicoloured, straight, navicular to cylindrical euseptate\nphragmospores borne on multiple percurrently extending, annellate\nconidiophores. Conidial secession is schizolytic leaving a protuberant\nhilum at the base of the conidium. The genus is compared with\nBelemnospora and other morphologically similar hyphomycete genera with\npercurrent conidiophores such as Endophragmiella, Junewangia,\nRepetophragma, and Sporidesmiella. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from\nnuclear ribosomal DNA sequence data placed Jennwenomyces within the\nSordariomycetes, clustered with species of Dictyosporella, Junewangia\nand Sporidesmiella in the family Junewangiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124319.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124321.phy"}]}
