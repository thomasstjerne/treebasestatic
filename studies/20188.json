The current\ntaxonomy includes three species on the Calidrinae (Carduiceps\nmeinertzhageni, Carduiceps scalaris, Carduiceps zonarius) and four\nspecies on non-calidrine hosts. We estimate a phylogeny of four of the\nseven species of Carduiceps (the three mentioned above and Carduiceps\nfulvofasciatus) from 13 of the 29 hosts based on three mitochondrial\nloci, and evaluate the relative importance of flyway differentiation\n(same host species has different lice along different flyways) and\nflyway homogenisation (different host species have the same lice along\nthe same flyway). We find no evidence for either process. Instead, the\npresent, morphology-based, taxonomy of the genus corresponds exactly to\nthe gene-based phylogeny, with all four included species monophyletic.\nCarduiceps zonarius is found both to inhabit a wider range of hosts than\nwing lice of the genus Lunaceps occurring on the same group of birds,\nand to occur on Calidris sandpipers of all sizes, both of which is\nunexpected for a body louse. The previously proposed family\nEsthiopteridae is found to be monophyletic with good support. The\nconcatenated data set suggests that the pigeon louse genus Columbicola\nmay be closely related to the auk and diver louse genus Craspedonirmus.\nThese two genera share some morphological characters with Carduiceps,\nbut no support was obtained for grouping these three genera together.\nBased on mitochondrial data alone, the relationships among genera within\nthis proposed family cannot be properly assessed, but some previously\nsuggested relationships within this proposed family are confirmed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100382","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100382.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100384","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100384.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100383","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100383.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100381.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100385.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100386.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100387","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100387.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100388","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100388.phy"}]}
