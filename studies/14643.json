Does species\ndiscreteness come from adaptation to fill discrete niches or from\ninterspecific gaps generated by reproductive isolation? We investigate\nthe importance of reproductive isolation by comparing genetic\ndiscreteness, in terms of intra- and interspecific variation, between\nfacultatively sexual monogonont rotifers and obligately asexual bdelloid\nrotifers. We calculated the age (phylogenetic distance) and average\npairwise genetic distance (raw distance) within and among evolutionary\nsignificant units of diversity in 6 bdelloid clades and 7 monogonont\nclades sampled for 4211 individuals in total. We find that monogonont\nspecies are more discrete than bdelloid species with respect to\ndivergence between species but exhibit similar levels of intraspecific\nvariation (species cohesiveness). This pattern arises because bdelloids\nhave diversified into discrete genetic clusters at a faster net rate\nthan monogononts. Although sampling biases or differences in ecology\nthat are independent of sexuality might also affect these patterns, the\nresults are consistent with the hypothesis that bdelloids diversified at\na faster rate into less discrete species because their diversification\ndoes not depend on the evolution of reproductive isolation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"AdinBEASTs","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Adineta spp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative
