The resupinate basidiocarp and\nlight orange, poroid hymenophore were different enough for it to be\ndistinguished from previously recorded species of Cerrena, C. consors,\nC. cystidiata, C. sclerodepsis and C. unicolor. Based on the results of\nmorphological and phylogenetic analyses, we propose this new polypore as\nCerrena aurantiopora sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2(C)","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerrena, 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2(A)","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales, 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6282.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2(B)","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerrena, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2(D)","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cerrena, RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6360.phy"}]}
