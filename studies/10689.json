We performed separate\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses of Halodule based on both plastid and\nnuclear DNA sequences, followed by haplotype analysis, focusing on\nplants in the western Pacific area. One western tropical Atlantic\nspecies, H. wrightii s.l., and two western Pacific species, H. pinifolia\nand H. uninervis, were recognised and characterised by leaf morphology.\nBecause samples from the western tropical Atlantic and the western\nPacific were nested with each other, allopatric differentiation into\nboth areas may have occurred during the early stages of the evolution of\nthe genus. A hybrid of Halodule was detected at two nearby localities in\nOkinawa, Japan, together with its co-occurring maternal and paternal\nspecies, H. uninervis and H. pinifolia, respectively. Haplotype analysis\nprovided evidence that the hybrid resulted from a single hybridisation\nevent, followed by clonal dispersal to its present localities.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridization of a tropical seagrass genus,\nHalodule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47721.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridization of a tropical seagrass genus,\nHalodule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47722.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridization of a tropical seagrass genus,\nHalodule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47723.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridization of a tropical seagrass genus,\nHalodule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47719.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybridization of a tropical seagrass genus,\nHalodule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47720.phy"}]}
