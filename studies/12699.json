Analysis of chloroplast and nuclear\nloci leaves uncertain its phylogenetic position within tribe Apocyneae,\nbut Templeton and winning sites tests reject with statistical\nsignificance its inclusion in Sindechites, Epigynum, or Cleghornia, the\nthree genera where it has been previously classified. In contrast, the\nmonophyly of Urceola and Epigynum is neither supported nor rejected,\nmaking any re-circumscription of these two genera premature. A close\nrelationship between Urceola and the monotypic genus Aganonerion,\nsampled for the first time in a molecular analysis, is supported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"strict con 6 MPTs","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apocynaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52631.phy"}]}
