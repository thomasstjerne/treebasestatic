{"Authors":" Nan Song","Year":" 2015","Title":" The mitochondrial genome of the Rhopalosiphum padi and an\napplication of mitogenomic analysis to the Hemiptera phylogeny","Journal":" Gene","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Rhopalosiphum padi, mitochondrial genome, aphid,\nHemiptera, phylogeny","DOI":"","Abstract":" The nearly complete nucleotide sequence of the\nmitochondrial genome (mitogenome) was determined for the aphid species\nof Rhopalosiphum padi by the RNAseq plus gap filling method. The\n15,113-bp mitogenome include all mitochondrial genes except for the\ntrnF. As a whole, the organization and size of the newly sequenced\nmitogenome of R. padi are similar to those previously reported for other\naphid species. In addition, three tandem repeat regions were discovered\nin the putative control region. Phylogenetic analyses (maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian inference) were performed on all mitochondrial\ngenes in combination with already published mitogenome sequence data of\n102 species of Hemiptera, and 19 species of Orthoptera, Psocoptera,\nPhthiraptera and Thysanoptera. The phylogenetic results are sensitive to\nmethod of analysis, model selection, taxon sampling and data treatment.\nThe monophyly of Aphidoidea is strongly supported. Within the Aphididae,\nR. padi is consistently recovered as a sister group of Schizaphis\ngraminum. The seven species representing Aleyrodidae exhibited extremely\nlong branches irrespective of the phylogenetic inference method used,\nand they frequently clustered with long-branched outgroups. This lead to\nthe failure of recovering a monophyletic Hemiptera in most analyses. The\ndata treatment of Degen-coding for protein-coding genes and\nsite-heterogeneous CAT model showed improvement in suppressing\nlong-branch effect. Within Hemiptera, the basal placement of\nSternorrhyncha was supported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
