This analysis places Maraniona in a strongly\nsupported subclade of the informal Pterocarpus clade of the dalbergioid\nlegumes. We discuss the endemic status of Maraniona in relation to\noverall endemism in the upper MaraÒon Valley as well as the possible\naffinities of Maraniona to the genus Tipuana from Argentina /\nBolivia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dalbergioid Clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4201.phy"}]}
