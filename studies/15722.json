In this study we\nsequenced and analyzed a fragment of the low-copy, nuclear phytochrome C\n(PHYC) gene and combined these data with the multigene data set (four\nplastid, one mitochondrial, two nuclear ribosomal loci) of Chase et\nal.Â (2006) to determine if adding this marker improved resolution and\nsupport of relationships among major lineages of monocots. Our results\nindicate the addition of PHYC to the multigene dataset increases support\nalong the backbone of the monocot tree, although relationships among\norders of commelinids remain elusive. We also estimated divergence times\nin monocots by applying newly-evaluated fossil calibrations to our\nresolved phylogenetic tree. Inclusion of early diverging angiosperm\nlineages confirmed the origin of extant monocots ca. 131 mya and\nstrengthen the hypothesis of recent divergence times for some lineages,\nalthough current divergence time estimation methods may inadequately\nmodel rate heterogeneity within monocots. We note significant shifts in\ndiversification in at least two monocot orders, Poales and Asparagales.\nWe describe patterns of diversification in the context of radiation of\nother relevant plant and animal lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"8geneBI","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot 8 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75296.phy"},{"tree_label":"8geneMLconstrained","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot 8 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75297.phy"},{"tree_label":"8geneMLunconstrained","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot 8 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75298.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYCBI","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot PHYC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75299.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYCML","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot PHYC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75300.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8s140","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot DivTime","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75308.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8s180","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot DivTime","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75310.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8s160","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot DivTime","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75309.phy"},{"tree_label":"multidivtime","ntax":"150","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocot DivTime","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75311.phy"}]}
