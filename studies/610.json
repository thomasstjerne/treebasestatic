The monophyly of\nHeterobranchia is additionally supported by the presence within this\ngroup of a large insert of variable length in the 18S rDNA gene in the\nregion corresponding to the E-10-1 helix of the RNA molecule. Cytochrome\nc oxidase I sequences were able to resolve fully the relationships among\nrepresentatives of ten families of Neogastropoda. Maximum parsimony,\nmaximum likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses of these data all\nrevealed that Buccinoidea and Muricoidea (sensu Thiele, 1929) each\nrepresent a clade, while the families assigned by Thiele and some\nsubsequent authors to the superfamily Volutoidea comprise a grade.\nAlthough the two toxoglossan taxa included in our study emerged as a\ngrade rather than a clade, denser taxonomic sampling of this group will\nbe undertaken to investigate further the paraphyly of Conoidea. Based on\npercent transversions at third codon positions of the CO I gene,\ndifferences among neogastropod families as well as those between the\nneogastropod families and Cerithium are comparable to genetic\ndifferences between orders of mammals, but are only slightly greater\nthan differences between genera of penaeid shrimp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neogastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3589.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6C","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neogastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3590.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apogastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3587.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neogastropoda","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3588.phy"}]}
