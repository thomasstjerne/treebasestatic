To overcome this obstacle\nwe developed an approach to amplify and sequence the rDNA fragment of\nAMF including all three widely applied variable molecular markers.  We\nused a nested PCR approach specific for AMF to amplify part of the rDNA\nspanning the majority of the SSU rRNA gene, complete ITS region and a\npart of the LSU rRNA gene (~2.5 kb). The PCR products were sequenced on\nthe PacBio platform utilizing the Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT)\nsequencing.  Employing this method for selected environmental DNA\nsamples, we were able to describe complex AMF communities consisting of\nvarious glomeromycotan lineages.  We showed the applicability of this\nnew 2.5 kb approach to provide robust phylogenetic assignment of AMF\nlineages without known sequences from pure cultures and to consolidate\ninformation about AMF taxa distribution coming from three widely used\nbarcoding regions into one integrative dataset.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127196","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127196.phy"}]}
