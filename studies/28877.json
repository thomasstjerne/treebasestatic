{"Authors":" Kaiyue Luo, Changlin Zhao","Year":" 2021","Title":" Additions to the knowledge of corticioid Xylodon\n(Schizoporaceae, Hymenochaetales): introducing three new Xylodon species\nfrom the southern China","Journal":" Diversity","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Biodiversity; Molecular systematics; Taxonomy; White rot\nfungi; Wood-decaying fungi; Yunnan Province","DOI":"","Abstract":" The corticioid fungi play crucial roles as decomposers in\nforest ecosystems, and three new corticioid fungi, Xylodon gossypinus,\nX. macrosporus and X. sinensis spp. nov. were collected in the forest\nfrom southern China, with the similar function to decompose the rotten\nwood, which are here proposed as new taxa based on a combination of\nmorphological features and molecular evidence. Sequences of ITS and nLSU\nrRNA markers of the studied samples were generated, and phylogenetic\nanalyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and\nBayesian inference methods. The ITS+nLSU analysis in Hymenochaetales\nrevealed that the three new species clustered into family\nSchizoporaceae, located in genus Xylodon; based on the ITS dataset, X.\ngossypinus was sister to X. ussuriensis; X. macrosporus closely grouped\nwith X. follis with a high supports; X. sinensis retrieved as two\nsisters to X. attenuatus and X. yarraensis with a lower supports.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
