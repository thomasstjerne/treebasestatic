Molecular analyses based on DNA\nsequences from RNA polymerase II subunit 2 (RPB2), translation\nelongation factor 1-a (EF1-a) and b-tubulin genes confirm that they are\nrecently derived sister species. Speciation appears to have followed an\nhistorical transoceanic dispersal event. Models of population structure\nand migration from TCS, IM, and coalescent-based analyses suggest there\nis little gene flow between the two species. The direction of dispersal,\ninvestigated using the progression rule and coalescent- based gene\ngenealogies, was likely from the New World to the Old World.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
