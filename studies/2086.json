A phylogeny of Diseae is inferred\nusing sequence data from all genera in the tribe, with an emphasis on\nresolving generic classifications within Coryciinae. Nuclear (ITS) and\nplastid (trnLF and matK) gene region sequences were analysed for 79\ningroup taxa and 3 outgroup taxa. Coryciinae is confirmed to be\ndiphyletic, with Disperis and Coryciinae sensu strico (s.s.) forming\nseparate monophyletic clades. The current genera Corycium and\nPterygodium are not monophyletic according to our analysis and we\npropose a subdivision of Coryciinae s.s. into 10 monophyletic clades\nincluding 3 monotypic groups. Previous generic classifications of\nCoryciinae s.s. have been hampered by convergent evolution of floral\nparts, a consequence of few pollinator species and limited pollinia\nattachment sites in the oil-bee pollination system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule B","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oil-Secreting Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3047.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule A","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oil-Secreting Orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3048.phy"}]}
