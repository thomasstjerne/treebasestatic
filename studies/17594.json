Molecular phylogenetic investigations have\nrevolutionized our understanding of fern phylogeny, however, to date,\nthese studies have relied almost exclusively on plastid data.  Methods:\nHere we take a curated phylogenomics approach to infer the first broad\nfern phylogeny from multiple nuclear loci, by combining broad taxon\nsampling (73 ferns and 12 outgroup species) with focused character\nsampling (25 loci comprising 35,877 bp), along with rigorous alignment,\northology inference and model selection.  Key results: Our phylogeny\ncorroborates some earlier inferences and provides novel insights; in\nparticular, we find strong support for Equisetales as sister to the rest\nof ferns, Marattiales as sister to leptosporangiate ferns, and\nDennstaedtiaceae as sister to the eupolypods. Our divergence-time\nanalyses reveal that divergences among the extant fern orders all\noccurred prior to ~200 MYA. Finally, our species-tree inferences are\ncongruent with analyses of concatenated data, but generally with lower\nsupport. Those cases where species-tree support values are higher than\nexpected involve relationships that have been supported by smaller\nplastid datasets, suggesting that deep coalescence may be reducing\nsupport from the concatenated nuclear data.  Conclusions: Our study\ndemonstrates the utility of a curated phylogenomics approach to\ninferring fern phylogeny, and highlights the need to consider underlying\ndata characteristics, along with data quantity, in phylogenetic\nstudies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87504.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrB
