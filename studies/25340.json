S. australiana is characterized\nby buff to olivaceous buff basidiocarps when dry, relatively big pores\n(57 per mm), rarely presence of rosette-like crystals, and allantoid\nbasidiospores measuring 3.74.3 × 1.01.3 μm. S. minutissima is\ncharacterized by its tiny basidiocarps, generative hyphae dominant at\ndissepiment edges, the presence of cystidioles, and allantoid\nbasidiospores measuring 3.84.4 × 0.91.3 μm. S. parallela differs from\nother species in the genus by its parallel tramal hyphae and lunate\nbasidiospores measuring 2.83.3 × 0.91.2 μm. S. srilankensis is\ncharacterized by both generative hyphae and skeletal hyphae dominant at\ndissepiment edges, and lunate basidiospores measuring 3.54.0 × 1.01.3\nμm. S. tenuis is distinguished from other species in the genus by small\npores (810 per mm) and long and allantoid basidiospores measuring 4.25.0\n× 0.81.0 μm.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121646.phy"}]}
