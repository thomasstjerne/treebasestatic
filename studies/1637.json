Nemania\nplumbea is characterized by soft-textured grey stromata on a persistent\nmat of white hyphae, pale brown ascospores with a short germ slit on the\nmore convex side. It also produces Geniculosporium-like anamorph in\nculture. In order to evaluate its phylogenetic relationships among\nrelated species and genera, ITS-5.8S rDNA and RPB2 were analyzed\nseparately and simultaneously. Results from the phylogenetic analyses\nindicate that there is close phylogenetic association between N. plumbea\nand N. aenea. A preliminary account into the natural grouping of\nXylariaceae based on ITS-5.8S rDNA and RPB2 sequences is also\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS-5.8S+RPB2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nemania plumbea sp. nov. and related taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2540.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS-5.8S rDNA","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nemania plumbea sp. nov. and related taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_784.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nemania plumbea sp. nov. and related taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2539.phy"}]}
