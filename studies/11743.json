It differs from all other known\nhornworts in that the spores are basically ovoid to spheroid, with\ncanaliculate-striate surface ornamentation. We have produced the first\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis to include the genus, using sequence\ndata from the chloroplast rbcL and mitochondrial nad5 genes. The result\ndoes not support it as an independent genus, but instead places it\nwithin Phaeoceros. Although spore morphology is very important in terms\nof hornwort taxonomy, our results suggest that caution must be taken\nwhen naming higher ranks (above species level) based solely on a single\ncharacter.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule-hattorioceros","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47639","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47639.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47640","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47640.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.100","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47641","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47641.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.200","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47642","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47642.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.300","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47643","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47643.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.400","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47644","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47644.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.500","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47645","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47645.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.600","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47646","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47646.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.700","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47647","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47647.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.800","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47648","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47648.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.900","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47649","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47649.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1000","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47650.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1100","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47651.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1200","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47652.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1300","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47653.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1400","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47654","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47654.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1500","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47655.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1600","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47656","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47656.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1700","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47657.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1800","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47658.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1900","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47659.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2000","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47660.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2100","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47661","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47661.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2200","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47662.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2300","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47663.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2400","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47664.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2500","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47665.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2600","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47666.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2700","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47667","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47667.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2800","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47668.phy"}]}
