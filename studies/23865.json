Basidiospores of T. foliicola specimens including holotype were\nellipsoid with irregular outline with a cyanophilic reaction.\nPhylogenetic analyses on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and\nlarge subunit (LSU) 28S region of fungal nuclear ribosomal RNA (nrRNA)\ngenes demonstrated that T. foliicola is the species of Gerhardtia also\ncharacterized by irregular shaped basidiospores. Thus, we transferred\nthis species from Tricholoma to Gerhardtia. Cultured mycelia of G.\nfoliicola on malt extract agar medium were characterized by producing\ncystidia covered with granules and abundant formation of thallic conidia\n(arthroconidia) with both schizolytic and rhexolytic secession.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115596.phy"}]}
