Phylogenetic analyses were based\non nSSU rDNA and the research resulted in 55 new sequences. The study\nincluded species available in algal collections and those isolated\ndirectly from the environment in Poland and the Czech Republic. As a\nresult, the obtained phylogenetic tree of Phacus includes 50 species,\nout of which 7 are represented on a tree for the first time (Phacus\nanacoelus, P. anomalus, P. curvicauda, P. elegans, P. lismorensis, P.\nminutus and P. stokesii) and many have been taxonomically verified. For\nall verified species, diagnostic descriptions were amended, the naming\nwas reordered and epitypes were designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phacus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128291.phy"}]}
