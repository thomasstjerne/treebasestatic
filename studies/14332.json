Some floral features are\nconstant within the family, but many vegetative, floral, pollen, and\nnutlet traits vary. Utilizing 224 species of Boraginaceae and related\ntaxa, five matrices were constructed with various combinations of\nmorphological characters, three chloroplast DNA regions, and one nuclear\nribosomal DNA region. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for these\nmatrices, and patterns of character evolution were examined.\nBoraginaceae is resolved as monophyletic, with Wellstedia as its sister.\nCodon is sister to Boraginaceae + Wellstedia. Although most of the\ninvestigated morphological characters have a low consistency index,\nparticular character states are synapomorphies for large clades in each\nof the tribes of the family. In Boraginaceae, the breeding system\nheterostyly evolved at least 12 times, which is the largest number of\norigins resolved in any family; therefore, Boraginaceae can serve as a\nmodel for the evolution and development of heterostyly. Nutlet\nornamentation is most diverse in Cynoglosseae and Trichodesmeae, while\npollen and floral features are most variable in Boragineae and\nLithospermeae. Phylogenetic relationships and patterns of character\nevolution identified in the present study set the stage for future work\ncreating an updated taxonomic system of Boraginaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"224","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boraginaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64871.phy"}]}
