They are also morphologically similar, forming\nhyaline, penicillate conidiophores and hyaline, straight to sinuous,\n01-septate phialoconidia. During a revision of gliocladiopsis-like\nisolates originating from rain forest areas of South America (Ecuador,\nFrench Guyana) and Southeast Asia (Singapore), multilocus phylogenetic\ninferences revealed the occurrence of seven new phylogenetic species;\nbased on partial DNA sequences encoding β-tubulin, translation\nelongation factor 1-α, histone H3, and the nuc rDNA internal transcribed\nspacer regions. These phylogenetic species revealed unique combinations\nof phenotype, allowing morphological distinction from their closest\nphylogenetic relatives. Four new species of Aquanectria and three new\nspecies of Gliocladiopsis are described and illustrated. Three of the\nfour Aquanectria species deviate from the other species in the genus\nhaving shorter conidia, which are in the size range observed in\nGliocladiopsis species. They are placed in Aquanectria based on the\nphylogenetic signal, but this also makes the morphological distinction\nbetween these genera obsolete.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gliocladiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_107704.phy"}]}
