In addition, it confirms the rampant\nhybridization (allopolyploidy) that has been long suspected within both\nCystopteris and Gymnocarpium. In some cases, these data provide the\nfirst DNA sequence-based evidence for previous hypotheses of polyploid\nspecies origins (such as the cosmopolitan G. dryopteris being an\nallotetraploid derivative of the diploids G. appalachianum and G.\ndisjunctum). Most of the allopolyploids, however, have no formal\ntaxonomic names. This pattern is particularly strong within the C.\nfragilis complex, where our results imply that the eight included\naccessions of “C. fragilis” represent at least six distinct\nallopolyploid taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP8","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75582","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75582.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75580","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75580.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75581","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75581.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75583","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75583.phy"}]}
