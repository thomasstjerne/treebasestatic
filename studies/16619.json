The highly dissimilar numbers of plant species and bee\nspecies involved in these mutualisms imply evolutionary host switching,\nasymmetric mutual dependencies, and uncoupled diversification. Among the\nclades with the best field data on oil bee behavior is the Angelonieae,\nwhich we here investigate to better understand the evolutionary time\nframe of this pollination syndrome.  Methods: We generated nuclear and\nplastid data matrices for 56% of the Angelonieae species (plus\noutgroups) and used Bayesian methods of molecular clock dating,\nancestral state reconstruction, and biogeographic inference.  Key\nresults: We found that Angelonieae have two major clades, Angelonia\n(including Monopera) and Basistemon, and Monttea, Melosperma, and\nOurisia.  Conclusions: Angelonieae date back to the Uppermost Eocene,\nca. 35 (26-47) Ma ago and diversified in dry areas of southern South\nAmerica; they switched from nectar to oil as a reward four or five times\nover the past 25 Ma. As predicted in a previous non-clock-dated study,\ndispersal to Australasia dates to the Miocene/Pliocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelonieae ITS plastid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79385.phy"}]}
