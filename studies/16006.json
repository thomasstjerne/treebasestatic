Since LMoV and LSV have\nbeen recently reported in Brazil, we detected the spreading of these\nviruses in 12 cultivation areas using simplex and multiplex RT-PCR with\nspecific primers designed for the respective coat protein (CP) genes\namplification. Eight fragments with 800 nt length obtained from the\nLMoV-infected and nine with 600 nt from LSV-infected lilies were\nsequenced. Phylogenetic analysis using the CP sequences clustered two\nBrazilian LMoV isolates in the same subtree with Tulip breaking\nvirus-lily strain (sin. LMoV) and Tulip band breaking virus, both from\nJapan. The other six LMoV Brazilian isolates share a common ancestor\nwith isolates from different countries. LSV isolates from Brazil\nclustered with isolates from Asia and The Netherlands, sharing a common\nancestor.Recombination detection analysis with partial CP sequences from\nboth viruses revealed a LMoV recombinant isolate (S44147-Netherlands)\nwhereas none event was supported for recombination among LSV isolates.\nTo our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst report on evidence of recombination\nbetween LMoV isolates and of a proposal for its classification into\ngroups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75750","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75750.phy"}]}
