E. senticosus produces a rich variety of saponins such as\noleanane-type, noroleanane-type, 29-hydroxyoleanan-type, and lupane-type\nsaponins. Genomic or transcriptomic approaches have not been used to\ninvestigate the saponin biosynthetic pathway in this plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85429.phy"}]}
