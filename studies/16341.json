In this paper we define the Ophion scutellaris\nspecies group. This species group is well-supported by analysis of DNA\n(ITS2, COI, and 28S D2-D3) and morphology. It includes the Palearctic\nspecies O. scutellaris and the Nearctic species O. idoneus. An\nintegrative analysis of DNA, geometric wing morphometrics, classical\nmorphometrics and qualitative morphology indicates that this species\ngroup contains a minimum of seven species in Canada, although the full\ndiversity of the group has likely not been sampled.
