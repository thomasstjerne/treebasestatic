Due to the lack of suitable diagnostic studies up\nto now, this work aimed to identify the Botryosphaeriaceae species that\ncause dieback on Annonaceae in Brazil. Based on combined phylogenetic\nanalyses of ITS, TEF-1a, TUB2 and RPB2, eight species of\nBotryosphaeriaceae were identified, namely Lasiodiplodia brasiliense, L.\ncrassispora, L. hormozganensis, L. iraniensis, L. pseudotheobromae, L.\nsubglobosa, L. theobromae and Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum. All species\nfound in this study were pathogenic and caused symptoms of necrosis in\nstems and dieback. Thus, this study confirms species of\nBotryosphaeriaceae as causal agents of dieback on Annonaceae in\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121100.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121101","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121101.phy"}]}
