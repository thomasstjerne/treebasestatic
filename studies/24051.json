The collection was cultured and\nsequenced, and a Blast search of the nuc 28S rDNA sequences revealed\ndothideomycetous affiliation, which close to the genus Neodactylaria,\nbut without a close match to a specific family or order. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of a multigene matrix containing a representative selection of\nDothideomycetes from four genes (nuc 18S rDNA, nuc 28S rDNA, rpb2 and\ntef1) revealed placement within Dothideomycetes but without a supported\nfamilial or ordinal affiliation. Based on the phylogenetic analyses and\nmorphological investigations, the new species Neodactylaria simaoensis\nare described and illustrated, and placed in the new family\nNeodactylariaceae and new order Neodactylariales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodactylaria simaoensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117049.phy"}]}
