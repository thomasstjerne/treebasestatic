Based on morphology and ITS15.8SITS2,\nnrLSU and tef 1 sequences data, seven new species are described: G.\ncircinatum, G. lumbricale, G. orientale, G. peregrinans, G.\nproliferatum, G. pseudoglutinosum, and G. triseptatum. The lectotype for\nGeoglossum glutinosum var. lubricum as well as the epitype for\nGlutinoglossum glutinosum are designated. The comprehensive\nmorphological study of G. heptaseptatum resulted in the discovery of\nascospores germinating by conidia inside the asci, which is first noted\nfor Glutinoglossum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fedosova","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105091.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105087.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105088.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105089.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105090.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fedosova","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105092.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105093","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105093.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105094","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105094.phy"}]}
