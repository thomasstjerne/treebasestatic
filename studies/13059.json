It represents the\nfirst ceratopsian dinosaur in the Korean peninsula and is assigned to\nKoreaceratops hwaseongensis gen. et sp. nov. Autapomorphies of\nKoreaceratops include very tall neural spines over five times higher\nthan the associated centra in the distal caudals, and a unique\nastragalus divided into two fossae by a prominent craniocau- dal ridge\non the proximal surface. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that\nKoreaceratops is positioned between Archaeoceratops and all more derived\nneoceratopsians, and the elongation of caudal neural spines was an\nimportant derived character in non-ceratopsid neoceratopsians. The very\ntall caudal neural spines in Koreaceratops, Montanoceratops,\nUdanoceratops, Protoceratops, and Bagaceratops appear to be\nhomoplasious, suggesting an independent adaptation, possibly for\nswimming. Skeletal evidence suggests that obligate quadrupedalism\noccurred gradually in neoceratopsians progressing from bipedal through\nfacultative quadrupedalism, to complete quadrupedalism in\nCoronosauria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55334.phy"}]}
