The Linnaea clade, however, has mostly been\nneglected and Zabelia has mostly been excluded from previous studies. We\npresent results of a molecular investigation including nine Abelia and\nfive Zabelia species based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnK, matK,\natpB-rbcL, trnL-F) DNA sequence data using maximum parsimony, Bayesian\ninference, and maximum likelihood. Our results indicate that Abelia is\nparaphyletic and possibly polyphyletic. The genus falls apart in a\nMexican clade, corresponding to Abelia section Vesalea, and an Asian\nclade (excluding A. spathulata), corresponding to Abelia section Abelia.\nA close relationship between Zabelia and other members of the\ntraditional Linnaea clade was not recovered by our analyses. Instead,\nZabelia was associated with either the Morina or Valeriana clade, though\nwith varying support. Support for a Linnaea clade without Zabelia is\nstrong. Although intergeneric relationships of the Linnaea clade remain\nunclear, several important, new insights are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"linn pla BI","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6832.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn nuc BI nozabelia","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6739.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn all BI nozabelia","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6890.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn nuc BI","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6729.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn pla BI nogaps","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6833.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn all BI nogaps","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6705.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn all BI","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6706.phy"},{"tree_label":"linn pla BI nozabelia","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dipsacales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6863.phy"}]}
