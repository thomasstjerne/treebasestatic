The new taxa,\nisolated from the rhizosphere of three African herbaceous plants,\nKyphocarpa angustifolia, Melhania acuminata and Sida cordifolia, are\ndescribed and illustrated by means of morphological and multilocus\nmolecular analyses based on sequences from five DNA loci (CAL, EF-1 Î±,\nRPB1, RPB2 and TUB). According to phylogenetic inference based on\nMaximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches, the newly discovered species\nare distributed in the Fusarium buharicum, F. fujikuroi and F.\nsambucinum species complexes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FBSC","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Fusarium FBSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112011.phy"},{"tree_label":"FFSC","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Fusarium FFSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112012.phy"},{"tree_label":"FSAMSC","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Fusarium FSAMSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112013.phy"}]}
