In\nthis study, phylogenetic analyses of nrDNA ITS and ETS sequences, cpDNA\nsequences (rps16 intron, rps16-trnK, rpl32-trnL, and tmL-trnT), and\nmorphological data, supplemented by observations of fruit anatomy and\nmicromorphology, were used to ascertain evolutionary relationships and\nconfirm generic boundaries within Angelica s.l. (including Angelica,\nArchangelica, Coelopleurum, Czernaevia, and Ostericum), with emphasis on\nits East Asian members. Most species of Angelica s.l. fall into two\nmajor, disparate clades, the Ostericum clade and the Angelica group,\nwith the latter comprising five major lineages that are distinguished\nboth molecularly and morphologically: Angelica s.S. (including\nCzernaevia), Archangelica, Coelopleurum, Glehnia, and a newly identified\nLittoral Angelica clade. A North American Angelica clade was also\ndistinguished in the ITS trees. Taxonomic realignments will be required,\nas many species of Angelica fall outside of Angelica s.S. and four\nspecies of Angelica occur outside of the Angelica group (A.\nhirsutiflora, A. oncosepala, A. paeoniifolia, and A. sinensis). The\nAngelica s.S. clade contains predominantly East Asian species and\ncomprises five major lineages, two of which represent plants exclusively\nfrom the eastern Himalayas; each of these five lineages can also be\ndefined morphologically. The results obtained are significantly\ndifferent from traditional treatments of Angelica s.l. and provide new\ninsights into the phylogeny and classification of the group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.2(b)","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelica, cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51664.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.8","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelica, morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51673.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62024","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62024.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51669.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelica, nr&cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.2(a)","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelica, nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Apioideae, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56107.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51663.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62025","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62025.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr56106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_56106.phy"}]}
