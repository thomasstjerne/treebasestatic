Although these regions are conserved as\nnational parks due to their unique biome, few reports of the fungal\nbiota are available. We examined mushroom fungi under such vegetation\nand found a unique yellowish-capped Tricholoma species. Multi-locus\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses and morphological observation of the\nspecimens showed that the Tricholoma species share the common ancestor\nwith T. fumosoluteum from North America. The Japanese yellowish-capped\nT. aff. fumosoluteum had larger basidiospores and basidia and shorter\npileipellis hyphae compared to T. fumosoluteum. Therefore, we describe\nT. aff. fumosoluteum as T. alpinum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus_tree","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_134201.phy"}]}
