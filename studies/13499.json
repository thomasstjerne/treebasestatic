Most of the isolates were identified as\nDiplodia corticola, while two isolates morphologically and\nphylogenetically (ITS and tef1-alpha sequences data) distinct from all\nother known species of Diplodia are described here as Diplodia\nquercivora sp. nov. In artificial inoculation experiments, D. quercivora\nproved to be pathogenic on three Mediterranean oak species causing\nnecrotic lesions on bark and wood tissues. In particular, among the oak\nspecies tested, pubescent oak was the most susceptible. In addition,\nphylogenetic analyses showed for the first time the existence of two\ndistinct lineages inside D. corticola population.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplodia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57928.phy"}]}
