Here, we use a microCT scan of\nthe skull of “Trionyx” kyrgyzensis from the late Early Cretaceous\n(Albian) of Kyrgyzstan as the basis for a thorough redescription of the\ncranial morphology of this species. New information includes the pattern\nof cranial circulation, which is comparable to all extant trionychids. A\nunique combination of cranial and postcranial characters of “Trionyx”\nkyrgyzensis allows us to establish for it a new genus Petrochelys. The\ndata regarding Petrochelys kyrgyzensis are incorporated into a\nphylogenetic analysis. When Petrochelys kyrgyzensis is analyzed without\nincluding additional, extinct taxa, it is placed in a highly derived\nposition within the extant Nilssonia. However, the addition of five\nCretaceousPaleogene taxa breaks up hypothesized long branches and\nresults in more basal positions for Petrochelys kyrgyzensis within\nrecovered trees. All results support the hypothesis that Petrochelys\nkyrgyzensis is a crown trionychid and a member of Trionychinae. Our\nresults highlight the importance of including multiple extinct taxa in\nphylogenetic analysis prior to using any of those taxa as calibration\npoints in divergence dating estimates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Scaffold Tree+","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101835.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adams+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101838.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101833.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat+","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101830.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Adams+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrochelys kyrgyzensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101834.phy"}]}
