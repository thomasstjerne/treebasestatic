Within the complex thalloid\nliverworts, Monocarpus resolves as sister to the Sphaerocarpales clade.\nA new line drawing of Monocarpus is provided, as are the first colour\nphotographs of living plants. Detailed ornamentation of the spores of\nMonocarpus collections from Australia and South Africa, as revealed by\nSEM, is reported, and some of the morphological features that unite and\nseparate Monocarpus and the Sphaerocarpales s. str. are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monocarpos","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89270.phy"}]}
