Species identification is essential for\ncontrolling disease, understanding epidemiology, and to guide the\nimplementation of phytosanitary measures against fungi from the genus\nDiaporthe. Accurate Diaporthe species separation requires using\nmulti-loci phylogenies. However, defining the optimal set of loci that\ncan be used for species identification is still an open problem.\nMethods. Here, we addressed that problem by identifying five loci that\nhave been sequenced in 142 Diaporthe isolates representing 96 species:\nTEF1, TUB, CAL, HIS and ITS. We then used every possible combination of\nthose loci to build, analyse, and compare phylogenetic trees. Results.\nAs expected, species separation is better when all five loci are\nsimultaneously used to build the phylogeny of the isolates. However,\nremoving the ITS locus has little effect on reconstructed phylogenies,\nidentifying the TEF1-TUB-CAL-HIS four loci tree as almost equivalent to\nthe five loci tree. We further identify the best 3-loci, 2-loci, and\n1-locus trees that should be used for species separation in the genus.\nDiscussion. Our results question the current use of the ITS locus for\nDNA barcoding in the genus Diaporthe and suggest that TEF1 might be a\nbetter choice if one locus barcoding needs to be done.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP TEF1 tree","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe MP TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101050.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe MP TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101049.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML TEF1 tree","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ML TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101048.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ML TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101051.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101052.phy"}]}
