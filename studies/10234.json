This fungus previously\nknown from Asia and Australia was recently reported from Hawaii and\nPuerto Rico. The ITS and large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal DNA plus\nthe fragments from the genes RPB2, TEF1 and the mitochondrial small\nribosomal subunit were sequenced for three isolates of D. nepheliae and\ncompared with other sequences of ascomycetes. It was determined that D.\nnepheliae represents a new lineage within the Eurotiomycetes. In\naddition, the sexual and asexual states of Dolabra nepheliae are\nre-described and illustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eurotiomycetes LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6956.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eurotiomycetes multigene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6726.phy"}]}
