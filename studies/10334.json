Anamorphs are oelomycetous and reside in the genus Phomopsis.\nPhomopsis amygdali is the causal agent of twig canker and blight of\nalmonds. In a recent survey of dieback of almonds in Portugal, the most\nfrequent fungi detected were iaporthe/Phomopsis species. Isolates from\nalmond and other Prunus species were characterised and grouped according\nto their microsatelliteprimed PCR (MSP-PCR) profiles and representatives\nof the different groups were selected for a phylogenetic study based on\nthe ITS rDNA region (ITS15.8SITS2). Combining morphological, cultural,\nmolecular and pathogenicity data, three species were distinguished.\nPhomopsis amygdali was shown to be the main pathogen on almond and is\nepitypified in the present work. Diaporthe neotheicola is reported for\nthe first time on this host. A third species represented by a single\nisolate could not be unequivocally identified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7227.phy"}]}
