Seventy-five accessions from sixty species\nrepresenting the geographical and morphological diversity present within\nthe genus were included in this study. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian\ninference analyses utilized ITS and matK datasets, analyzed separately\nand combined. Based on this study the genus Sisyrinchium is monophyletic\nand is sister to Olsynium. The currently accepted subgenera, Echthronema\nand Sisyrinchium, are not monophyletic. Instead, all analyses revealed\neight major clades, which correspond to named sections or are given\ninformal clade names. Relationships among the eight major clades are\nresolved except for basal clades where topologies for the two\ngene-region trees did not agree. Additionally, several widespread\nspecies are not monophyletic based on data from these two molecular\nmarkers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"comb 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sisyrinchium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25556.phy"}]}
