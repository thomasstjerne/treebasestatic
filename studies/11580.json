We investigate the role played by\nthe cushion life form in the evolution of climatic niches in the plant\ngenus Androsace s.l., which spreads across the mountain ranges of the\nNorthern Hemisphere. Using robust methods that account for phylogenetic\nuncertainty, intraspecific variability of climatic requirements and\ndifferent life history evolution scenarios, we show that climatic niches\nof Androsace s.l. exhibit low phylogenetic signal and that they evolved\nrelatively recently and punctually. Models of niche evolution fitted\nonto phylogenies show that the cushion life form has been a key\ninnovation providing the opportunity to occupy extremely cold\nenvironments, thus contributing to rapid climatic niche diversification\nin the genus Androsace s.l. We then propose a plausible scenario for the\nadaptation of plants to alpine habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46277.phy"}]}
