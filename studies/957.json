Large\nmorphological diversity and increased specialization is observed in\nwater flea limbs (Cladocera), but it is unclear if the increased limb\nspecialization in different cladoceran orders is the result of shared\nancestry or parallel evolution. Here, we inferred the first robust\namong-order cladoceran phylogeny using small-subunit and large-subunit\nrRNA nuclear gene sequence, signature sequence regions, novel\nstem-loops, and secondary structure morphometrics to assess the\nphylogenetic distribution of limb specialization. The sequence-based and\nstructural rRNA morphometric phylogenies were congruent and suggested\nmonophyly of orders with raptorial limbs, but paraphyly of orders with\nreduced numbers of specialized limbs. These results highlight the\nutility of complex molecular structural characters in resolving ancient,\nrapid radiations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Branchiopod rRNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_878.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Branchiopod morphometrics","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_877.phy"}]}
