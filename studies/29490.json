(Poaceae, Panicoideae, Paspaleae)","Journal":" Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" ETS, Gramineae, informal groups, ndhF, rpl16, systematics,\ntaxonomy, trnH-psbA","DOI":"","Abstract":" Paspalum L. is one of richest genera within Poaceae,\nincluding nearly 350 species, mostly native to the Americas. The genus\nhas been divided generally into four subgenera, 27 sections and about 30\ninformal groups, based exclusively on morphological features. The group\nCaespitosa comprises a complex of 1315 perennial species characterized\nby its mostly caespitose habit, culms simple or occasionally with a\nsingle branch, inflorescences pauci to pluriracemose, and spikelets\nusually ellipsoid. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have\nsuggested that the group Caespitosa might not be monophyletic but, did\nnot analyze a large enough sample of taxa for a meaningful conclusion.\nIn this study, we increased the number of species sampled (13 Caespitosa\nspecies) and sequenced four DNA regions (ETS, ndhF, rpl16, and\ntrnH-psbA). We tested whether Caespitosa, as traditionally\ncircumscribed, does not represent a natural group and analyzed its\nrelationships using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference. Our\nfindings show the group Caespitosa is polyphyletic, with its species\ndistributed in seven moderately to strongly supported clades. All clades\nare morphologically distinctive, not correlated with the existing\ninfrageneric classification, and one is associated with geographic\nisolation. The relationships between some clades and species are unclear\nand have also been discussed here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
