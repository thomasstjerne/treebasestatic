Trichoderma\nzonatum is characterized by pulvinate, pale yellow to light brown\nstromata with densely disposed dark green to black ostioles, monomorphic\nascospores, simple trichoderma-like conidiophores, green and subglobose\nconidia. Trichoderma fujianense produces gliocladium to\nverticillium-like conidiophores, slender to lageniform phialides, green\nand ellipsoidal to oblong conidia. Their phylogenetic positions were\ninvestigated inferred from sequence analyses of the combined RNA\npolymerase II subunit b and translation elongation factor 1-Î± genes. The\nresults indicate that T. zonatum belongs to the Chlorospora clade and is\nassociated with but clearly separated from T. rosulatum and T.\ncostaricense. Trichoderma fujianense, along with T. aureoviride and T.\ncandidum, represents an independent lineage with high statistical\nsupport. Morphological distinctions and sequence divergences between the\nnew species and their close relatives were discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109572.phy"}]}
