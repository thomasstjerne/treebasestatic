The species has also been\nreported once from China, but the precise information on its occurrence\nin Asia is unknown. We collected fruiting bodies of C. caespitosa in a\nsubalpine coniferous forest in central Japan. The ITS phylogeny shows\nthat the Japanese collections are more closely related to one of the\nNorth American infraspecific lineages than to the European lineage.\nThus, these Japanese collections could be a missing link in the\nphylogeography of the genus Chamonixia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamonixia caespitosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88900.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chamonixia caespitosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88901.phy"}]}
