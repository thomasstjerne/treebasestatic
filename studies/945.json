Arg.) R. S.\nPoulsen & Sochting comb. nov. and Orceolina kerguelensis (Tuck.)\nHertel. Descriptions of the species are provided. In addition the\nphylogeny of the genus Orceolina and allied taxa was investigated using\nnucleotide sequences of the LSU rRNA gene. Sequences from these regions\nof nine agyrialean fungi were aligned ro those of four representatives\nof Pertusariales used as outgroup. The alignment was analysed\ncladistically using maximum parsimony. The two Orceolina clustered\ntogether within the Agyriaceae. The placement in the family is supported\nby high bootstrap values and the Kishino-Hasegawa test.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orceolina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_846.phy"}]}
