The new taxon, which was collected\nfrom central Madagascar, is strikingly similar to L. edodes, the\nshiitake mushroom. A BLAST search using ITS sequences from L.\nmadagasikarensis as the query retrieves a mix of Lentinula, Gymnopus,\nMarasmiellus, and other members of Omphalotaceae as the top hits. A 28S\nphylogeny of the Omphalotaceae confirms placement of L. madagasikarensis\nwithin Lentinula. An ITS phylogeny places L. madagasikarensis as the\nsister group of L. aciculospora, which is a neotropical species.\nLentinula madagasikarensis is characterized by robust basidiomata with\nvinaceous pilei, prominent floccose scales near the pileus margin,\nflorets of sphaeropedunculate cheilocystidia, and subcylindrical\nbasidiospores. This report constitutes a 4 000-mile, trans-oceanic range\nextension for Lentinula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lentinula madagasikarensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135421.phy"}]}
