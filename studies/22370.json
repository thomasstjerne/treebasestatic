Spegazzini´s original material was lost;\nfor that reason, C. magellanicus was re-described and validated with a\nneotype by Moser & Horak in 1975. Since then, Cortinarius\nmagellanicus was considered a living fossil of Nothofagaceae forests, as\nit is the most frequent and widely distributed species of Cortinarius in\nthe Southern Hemisphere (Argentina, Chile and New Zealand). However, our\nknowledge on Patagonian Cortinarius diversity is still poor and mainly\nbased on Moser & Horak´s work. Therefore, we carried out an\nextensive sampling of Cortinarius species growing in Argentinian\nNothofagaceae forests during March to May 2017. These recent collections\nrecognized as C. magellanicus by classical morpho-anatomical characters\nwere used for a phylogenetic analysis based on rDNA ITS sequences.\nSequences from Cortinarius type material and closely related sequences\nfrom GenBank are also included in the study. Our results showed that C.\nmagellanicus represents a complex of species composed of at least three\nphylogenetic lineages, each with strong regionalism and distinct host\nassociations. This complex is closely related to C. janthinophaeus, with\ndry pilei and stipe, thus being a typical representative of the subgenus\nTelamonia. This highlights that, especially in the Southern Hemisphere,\nmany infrageneric groups of Cortinarius have the tendency to form a\nglutinous layer on pileus and stipe. In South America C. magellanicus\nss. is restricted to sub-Antarctic regions of Argentina and Chile. The\nrecords erroneously reported from New Zealand and Australia are\nmisidentified and represent distinct lineages. In the present\ncontribution the re-description of Cortinarius magellanicus Speg. is\nbased on Patagonian neotype material. Moreover, C. magellanicoalbus and\nC. roblerauli are proposed as new species based on consistent\nmorpho-anatomical characters and the typical ecology of their habitats.\nCortinarius vitreopileatus var. similissimus is described as a new\nvariety for a taxon from New Zealand resembling C. magellanicus. A key\nto the species, which morphologically resemble C. magellanicus is also\nincluded. The taxonomic delimitation of the taxa belonging to the C.\nmagellanicus species complex is of high relevance due to the abundance\nof these fungi, their ectomycorrhizal role and relationships in\nNothofagaceae forests in the sub-Antarctic regions of South America and\nAustralasia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110478","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110478.phy"},{"tree_label":"C_maleggalnicus_ML","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110479","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110479.phy"},{"tree_label":"Magellanicus_ML","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110480","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110480.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111814.phy"}]}
