Most sibling species in the complex\nare well known because recent extensive studies. Ganoderma aridicola sp.\nnov., a new member of the G. lucidum complex, is described and\nillustrated from South Africa based on the combination of morphological\nand molecular evidence. The new species is characterized by its fuscous\nto black pileal surface with distinct concentric zones and obvious\nfurrows, small pores; in additionn, it was found in a dry environment.\nPhylogenetically, sequences data from nuclear internal transcribed\nspacer regions (ITS) and the translation elongation factor 1-α gene\n(EF1-α) confirmed that G. aridicola is a new species within the G.\nlucidum complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100404.phy"}]}
