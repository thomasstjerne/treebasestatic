While studies to date have mostly targeted local or regional\nspecies assemblages, the recent launch of the global iBOL project\n(International Barcode of Life), highlights the need to understand the\neffects of geographical scale on Barcodings goals. Sampling has been\ncentral in the debate on DNA Barcoding, but the effect of the\ngeographical scale of sampling has not yet been thoroughly and\nexplicitly tested with empirical data. Here, we present a CO1 data set\nof aquatic predaceous diving beetles of the tribe Agabini, sampled\nthroughout Europe, and use it to investigate how the geographic scale of\nsampling affects 1) the estimated intraspecific variation of species, 2)\nthe genetic distance to the most closely related heterospecific, 3) the\nratio of intraspecific and interspecific variation, 4) the frequency of\ntaxonomically recognized species found to be monophyletic, and 5) query\nidentification performance based on 6 different species assignment\nmethods. Intraspecific variation was significantly correlated with the\ngeographical scale of sampling (R-square = 0.7), and more than half of\nthe species with 10 or more sampled individuals (N = 29) showed higher\nintraspecific variation than 1% sequence divergence. In contrast, the\ndistance to the closest heterospecific showed a significant decrease\nwith increasing geographical scale of sampling. The average genetic\ndistance dropped from >7% for samples within 1 km, to <3.5% for\nsamples up to >6000 km apart. Over a third of the species were not\nmonophyletic, and the proportion increased through locally, nationally,\nregionally, and continentally restricted subsets of the data. The\nsuccess of identifying queries decreased with increasing spatial scale\nof sampling; liberal methods declined from 100% to around 90%, whereas\nstrict methods dropped to below 50% at continental scales. The\nproportion of query identifications considered uncertain (more than one\nspecies <1% distance from query) escalated from zero at local, to 50%\nat continental scale. Finally, by resampling the most widely sampled\nspecies we show that even if samples are collected to maximize the\ngeographical coverage, up to 70 individuals are required to sample 95%\nof intraspecific variation. The results show that the geographical scale\nof sampling has a critical impact on the global application of DNA\nbarcoding. Scale-effects result from the relative importance of\ndifferent processes determining the composition of regional species\nassemblages (dispersal and ecological assembly) and global clades\n(demography, speciation, and extinction). The incorporation of\ngeographical information, where available, will be required to obtain\nidentification rates at global scales equivalent to those in regional\nbarcoding studies. Our result hence provides an impetus for both smarter\nbarcoding tools and sprouting national barcoding initiativessmaller\ngeographical scales deliver higher
