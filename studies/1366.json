We present\nthe first cladistic analysis sampling multiple representatives of most\nmajor groups based on DNA sequence for three nuclear (GHR, RAG1, AP5)\nand one mitochondrial (COII and parts of COI and ATPase 8) fragments.\nAnalyzed separately, the four partitions agree broadly with each other\nand the combined analysis. The basal split is between a clade of\nPhilippine Old Endemics and all remaining murines. Within the latter,\nrapid radiation led to at least seven geographically distinct lineages,\nincluding a Southeast Asian Rattus clade; a diverse Australo-Papuan and\nPhilippine clade; an African arvicanthine group including the otomyines;\nan African Praomys group; and three independent genera from Africa and\nAsia, Mus, Apodemus, and Malacomys. The murines appear to have\noriginated in Southeast Asia and then rapidly expanded across all of the\nOld World. Both nuclear exons provide robust support at all levels. In\ncontrast, the bootstrap proportions from mitochondrial data decline\nrapidly with increasing depth in the tree, together suggesting that\nnuclear genes may be more useful even for relatively recent divergences\n(<10 MY).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2135.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2133.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2134.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2136.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Old World mice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2137.phy"}]}
