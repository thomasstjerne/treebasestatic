These\nspecies comprised a monophyletic group defined by two synapomorphies:\nmutualistic symbiosis with terrestrial plants and production of\nspecialized dichotomously branched intraradical arbuscules interfacing\nhost and fungal symbiont. Members of Endogone, another genus in the\nEndogonaceae, did not share these characters and thus were a\npolyphyletic group related to some arbuscular species in Clomus and\nSclerocystis only by convergence. Two main branches were hypothesized to\nhave evolved from a common arbuscular ancestor. One branch consisted of\nCigaspora and Scutellospora, as defined by extraradical auxiliary cells\nand spores formed within a thin unit wall on a sporogenous cell. The\nother branch consisted of Clomus, Sclerocystis, Acaulospora, and\nEntrophospora, as defined by intraradical vesicles in mycorrhizal roots.\nParallelisms were numerous within all descendant monophyletic fungal\ngroups, lowering resolution of branching patterns. The cladogram and\nphylogenetic tree reconstructed from this analysis establish a\ntheoretical framework for future studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endogonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1412.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endogonaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1413.phy"}]}
