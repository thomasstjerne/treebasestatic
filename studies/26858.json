The phylogenetic relationship of Stanjehughesia\nspecies was sought among representative taxa from related fungal\nlineages in the Sordariomycetes using the LSU sequences. Molecular data\nrevealed the phylogenetic placement of S. kaohsiungensis in the\nChaetosphaeriaceae, and is distinct from Sporidesmiaceae. While the\ngenus Stanjehughesia may be polyphyletic, a synopsis of morphological\ncharacters for accepted Stanjehughesia species and a taxonomic key to\nthese species are provided to ease identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Stan LSU Tree","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125577","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125577.phy"}]}
