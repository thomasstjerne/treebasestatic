This new species,\nFemsjonia uniseptata, is characterized by the presence of discoid to\napplanate basidiocarps having white hairs at the margins, thin-walled\ninternal and marginal hyphae with clamp connections, and 01-septate\nbasidiospores. According to a molecular phylogenetic analysis, F.\nuniseptata is closely related to a specimen identified as F.\npeziziformis. Within Femsjonia, F. uniseptata is morphologically most\nsimilar to F. pezizoidea; however, the latter species has turbinate or\nobconic basidiocarps, thick-walled internal and marginal hyphae, and\n3-septate basidiospores. The new species is also similar to Dacrymyces\ncorticioides, but the latter has 13-septate basidiospores. With the\naddition of F. uniseptata, the genus Femsjonia now comprises seven\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Femsjonia LSU+ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103364.phy"}]}
