The\nestablishment of novel life history strategies involves multilocus\npolymorphisms, which will be challenging to establish in the face of\ngene flow and recombination. Theory predicts that adaptive allelic\ncombinations may be maintained and spread if they occur in genomic\nregions of reduced recombination, such as chromosomal inversion\npolymorphisms, yet empirical support for this prediction is lacking.\nHere, we use genomic data to investigate the evolution of divergent\nadaptive ecotypes of the yellow monkey flower Mimulus guttatus. We show\na large chromosomal inversion polymorphism is the major region of\ndivergence between geographically widespread annual and perennial\necotypes. In contrast, ~40,000 SNPs in collinear regions of the genome\nshow no signal of life history, revealing genomic patterns of diversity\nhave been shaped by localised homogenizing gene flow and large-scale\nPleistocene range expansion. Our results provide evidence for an\ninversion capturing and protecting loci involved in local adaptation,\nwhile also explaining how adaptive divergence can occur with gene\nflow.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"179","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mimulus guttatus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86201.phy"}]}
