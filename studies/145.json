The expanded genus includes 79 species, almost\nall of which are South American. Piptochaetium and Stipa sect.\nHesperostipa are suggested as the closest extant relatives.\nSynapomorphies of the three taxa are: brownish callus hairs; fused lemma\napices; bulbous-based lemma cilia; silicified lemma fundamental cells;\nand long epiblasts. A key to putatively monophyletic groups in American\nStipeae and a synopsis of Nassella s.l., involving more than 60 new\ncombinations, are presented. The transferred species include\nrepresentatives from seven subgenera of Stipa L. described by\nSpegazzini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nassella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1590.phy"}]}
