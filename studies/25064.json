To re-evaluate and delimit this genus,\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed using the large and\nsmall subunits of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nucLSU and nuc\u0002SSU), the small\nsubunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (mtSSU) and the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1Î±). The results indicated that the\nConidiobolus is not monophyletic, being grouped into a paraphyletic\ngrade with four clades. Consequently, the well-known Conidiobolus is\nrevised and three new genera Capillidium, Microconidiobolus and\nNeoconidiobolus are proposed along with one new record and 22 new\ncombinations. In addition, the genus Basidiobolus is found to be basal\nto the other entomoph\u0002thoroid taxa and the genus Batkoa locates in the\nEntomophthoraceae clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidiobolus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121054.phy"}]}
