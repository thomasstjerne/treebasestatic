Since\nmolecular phylogenies revealed two of those orders (Amoebidiales and\nEccrinales = “protist trichos”) to be closely related to members of the\nprotist class Ichthyosporea (= Mesomycetozoea), trichomycetes have been\nconsidered an ecological association of both early-diverging fungi and\nprotists. Understanding of the taxonomy, evolution, and diversity of the\nprotist trichos is lacking largely due to the difficulties inherent in\nspecies collection that have contributed to undersampling and\nunderstudy. The most recent classification divides the protist trichos\nbetween two families, Amoebidiidae and Eccrinidae (suborder\nTrichomycina, order Eccrinida). However, there is no comprehensive\nmolecular phylogeny available for this group and major questions about\nthe systematics of protist trichos remain unanswered. Therefore, we\ngenerated 18S and 28S rDNA sequences for 106 protist tricho samples and\ncombined them with publicly available Eccrinida sequences for\nphylogenetic analyses. We also sequenced a conserved protein-coding gene\n(heat-shock 70 protein) to obtain a multigene data set. We conducted\nancestral state reconstruction (ASR) and Bayesian tip-association\nsignificance test (BaTS) analyses by mapping six morphological and\necological characters onto the resulting phylogenetic trees. Our results\ndemonstrate: 1) several ecological and morphological character states\n(habitat, host type, host stage at time of infestation, location within\nhost, spore production, and growth form) are significantly correlated\nwith the phylogeny, and 2) two additional protist tricho families should\nbe incorporated into the taxonomy to reflect phylogenetic relationships.\nOur data suggest that an integrated strategy that combines\nmorphological, ecological, and molecular characters is needed to further\nresolve and clarify the systematics of the Eccrinida.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102285.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102286.phy"}]}
