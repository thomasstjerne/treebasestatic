It is the first\nreport of freshwater fungi encountered in Sclerococcaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aquatic Hyphomycetes in Sclerococcaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114038.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aquatic Hyphomycetes in Sclerococcaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114037.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aquatic Hyphomycetes in Sclerococcaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114036.phy"}]}
