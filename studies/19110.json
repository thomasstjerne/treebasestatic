Three species in Haploporus, H. cylindrospora, H. septata\nand H. subpapyraceus, are described as new based on morphological\ndifferences and molecular phylogenetic analyses inferred from the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large subunit nuclear ribosomal\nRNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the\nsecond subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) and the translation\nelongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1) sequences. Haploporus cylindrospora is\ncharacterized by big irregular crystals occasionally presenting in\nsubiculum, abundant oily substance among hyphae and typically\ncylindrical basidiospores of 1011.5 ´ 4.55 μm; H. septata differs from\nother species in the genus by leathery to corky basidiomata when dry,\nsmall round pores (56 per mm), simple septate skeletal hyphae at edge of\ndissepiment, and oblong to ellipsoid basidiospores of 8.511 × 56 μm; H.\nsubpapyraceus is separated by white to cream basidiomata, numerous\napically simple septate cystidioles and ellipsoid basidiospores of 912 ×\n5.58 μm. An identification key to accepted species of Haploporus was\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haploporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107560.phy"}]}
