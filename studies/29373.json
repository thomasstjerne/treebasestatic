Sequences\nof ITS and nLSU rRNA markers of the studied samples were generated, and\nphylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum likelihood, maximum\nparsimony, and Bayesian inference methods. The morphology and molecular\nsystematics supporting a new fungal order Xenasmatales to accommodate\nthe taxa of Xenasmataceae. Based on the ITS+nLSU analysis from 13 orders\nindicated that Xenasmatales formed a single lineage and then grouped\nwith Hymenochaetales and Atheliales. The ITS dataset revealed that the\nnew taxa Xenasmatella nigroidea clustered into genus Xenasmatella, in\nwhich X. nigroidea closely grouped with X. vaga. Xenasmatella nigroidea\nsp. nov. was collected from southern China, with the similar function to\ndecompose rotten wood, which are here proposed as new taxa based on a\ncombination of morphological features and molecular evidence. There are\ntwo new combinations species of genus Xenasmatella are proposed as X.\ngossypina and X. wuliangshanensis. Additionally, a key of Xenasmatella\nin China is summarized in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
