Walt and P. setulosum Turcz. showed\nthat they should be included in section Campylia (Sweet) DC. A key to\nidentity the species of section Campylia s.l. is provided. Despite the\nconsiderable variation in floral structure of the species it is\nconcluded that section Campylia s.l. is a natural taxon. The possible\nphylogenetic relationships of the species are determined by means of a\ncladistic analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pelargonium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4268.phy"}]}
