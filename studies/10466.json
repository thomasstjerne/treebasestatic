Exo- and\nendoskeleton, musculature, elements of the central nervous system and\ntracheae are compared to conditions found in other groups of\nNeuropterida and other endopterygote lineages. 36 adult cephalic\ncharacters were compiled, combined in a datamatrix with 64 characters of\nthe larval head, and analysed cladistically. Mainly due to many missing\ndata for adults most branches in the cladogram were mainly or\nexclusively supported by larval features. The shortening of the mesal\nmandibular wall and the resulting anterior shift of the adductor tendon\nis a potential adult groundplan apomorphy of Neuropterida. Raphidioptera\nand Megaloptera share the distinct prognathism and the presence of a\nsclerotised gula. However, the orthognathous head and the absence of a\ngula were retrieved as autapomorphies of Neuroptera in our analyses.\nFurther potential autapomorphies are the presence of dorsolateral\nfurrows on the head capsule, the asymmetry of the mandibles, the\npresence of a shovel-like extension of the ventral mandibular cutting\nedge, and the presence of a row of stiff hairs on the ventral side. The\nsystematic affinities of Osmylidae remain ambiguous. Osmylus is mainly\ncharacterised by plesiomorphic features of the adult head such as a\ncomplete endoskeleton, long filiform antennae, largely unmodified\northopteroid mouthparts, and particularly the nearly complete set of\nmuscles. The placement with a clade also comprising Hemerobiidae and\nChrysopidae is poorly supported. The presence of a dense vestiture of\nlong microtrichia on the distal galeomere was retrieved as a\nsynapomorphy of the three families. An apparently plesiomorphic\npreserved in Osmylus but absent in all other groups of Neuroptera is the\npresence of well developed ocelli. The present study underlines the\nsevere lack of detailed morphological data for adults. Intensive study\nof adult structures is required for a solid reconstruction of the\nphylogeny of Neuropterida, especially of the hemerobiform lineage of\nNeuroptera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9003.phy"},{"tree_label":"t2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9004.phy"},{"tree_label":"t5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9007.phy"},{"tree_label":"t4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9006.phy"},{"tree_label":"t3","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9005.phy"},{"tree_label":"t21","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9023.phy"},{"tree_label":"t20","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9022.phy"},{"tree_label":"t19","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9021.phy"},{"tree_label":"t18","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9020.phy"},{"tree_label":"t17","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9019.phy"},{"tree_label":"t16","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9018.phy"},{"tree_label":"t15","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9017.phy"},{"tree_label":"t14","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9016.phy"},{"tree_label":"t13","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9015.phy"},{"tree_label":"t12","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9014.phy"},{"tree_label":"t11","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9013.phy"},{"tree_label":"t10","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9012.phy"},{"tree_label":"t9","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9011.phy"},{"tree_label":"t8","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9010.phy"},{"tree_label":"t7","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9009.phy"},{"tree_label":"t6","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmylus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9008.phy"}]}
