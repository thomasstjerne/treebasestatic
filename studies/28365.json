Pteroclava lives in association with octocorals and with\nother hydrozoans, whereas Cladocoryne is a generalist in terms of\nsubstrate choice. This work provides a thorough morpho-molecular\nreassessment of the Cladocorynidae by presenting the first\nwell-supported phylogeny of the family based on the analyses of three\nmitochondrial and four nuclear markers. Notably, the two nominal genera\nare confirmed to be monophyletic and both morphological and genetic data\nled to the formal description of a new genus associated with octocorals,\nPseudozanclea gen. nov. Maggioni & Montano. Accordingly, the\ndiagnosis of the family was updated. The ancestral state reconstruction\nof selected characters revealed that the symbiosis with octocorals\nlikely appeared in the most recent common ancestor of Pteroclava and\nPseudozanclea. Additionally, the presence of euryteles aggregation in\nthe polyp stage and the exumbrellar nematocyst pouches with euryteles\nrepresent synapomorphies of all cladocorynid taxa and emerged in their\nmost recent common ancestor. The analysis of several Pteroclava krempfi\ncolonies from Indo-Pacific and Caribbean localities associated with\nseveral host octocorals revealed a high intra-specific genetic\nvariability. Single- and multi-locus species delimitations resulted in\nthree to five species hypotheses, but the statistical analysis of\nmorphometric data showed only limited distinction among the cryptic\nforms of Pt. krempfi. However, Pt. krempfi clades showed differences in\nboth host specificity, mostly at the octocoral family level, and\ngeographic distribution, with one clade found exclusively in the\nCaribbean Sea and the other ones found in the Indo-Pacific.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131569.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131570","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131570.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131602","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131602.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131597.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131598","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131598.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131599","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131599.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131600.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131601.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131603","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131603.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131604","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131604.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131605.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131608.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131606.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131607.phy"}]}
