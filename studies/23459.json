With two exceptions, Frithia pulchra\nand Delosperma esterhuyseniae, all accessions are retrieved in a single,\nunsupported Delosperma s.l. clade. The main Delosperma s.str. clade is\nwell supported and falls in three subclades, one comprising the two\nMestoklema accessions, the other two mainly Delosperma accessions, but\nalso Corpuscularia and Ectotropis. These genera are therefore subsumed\nunder Delosperma. Trichodiadema accessions are retrieved in several\nplaces inside the Delosperma s.l. clade. The East African-Arabian\nDelosperma species are monophyletic if D. alpina from the Drakensberg is\nincluded; but they are not monophyletic with the species from Madagascar\nand RÃ©union. The species of the Central Plateau of southern Africa are\nalso monophyletic and sister to the East African-Arabian species. Two\nnew species, Delosperma heidihartmanniae and D. melepoense, are here\ndescribed in the East African-Arabian clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Delosperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130669.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Delosperma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130670.phy"}]}
