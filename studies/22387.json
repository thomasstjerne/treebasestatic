It has\na high rate of mycelial growth and regeneration and was found growing on\nboth dry and green leaves of shrubs; attached to the base of living\ntrees, and it was also observed to degrade dead snakes and insects\naccidentally coming into contact with it. Phylogenetic analyses based on\nindividual and concatenated data sets of nrLSU, nrSSU, and the RPB2 and\nTEF1 genes showed it, together with Laetiporus, Phaeolus, Pycnoporellus\nand Wolfiporia, to form a monophyletic group in Polyporales. Based on\nmorphological features and molecular data, it is described as\nKusaghiporia usambarana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110491.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110492.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110493.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110494.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110495.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110496.phy"}]}
