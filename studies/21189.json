This genus is characterized by the\npresence of immersed ascomata with an excentric to central, short\ncylindrical ostiolar neck, thin ascomatal wall, clavate asci with a\nshallow ocular chamber, and broadly fusiform, hyaline to pale brown\nascospores with a sheath. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on a\ncombined data set of sequences of 18S and 28S nuc rDNA genes and the\nsecond largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) revealed that\nBrevicollum is a member of Neohendersoniaceae (Pleosporales,\nDothideomycetes). The genera Brevicollum, Crassiparies, Medicopsis, and\nNeohendersonia are accepted in Neohendersoniaceae. Revised descriptions\nof Crassiparies and its type species, C. quadrisporus, are provided\nbased on the holotype and a newly obtained specimen and isolate. An\nasexual morph of C. quadrisporus is reported for the first time. The nuc\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) phylogenetic\ntree of the newly collected species (B. hyalosporum, B. versicolor, and\nC. quadrisporus), and the unnamed or provisionally identified endophytic\nspecies, suggests a broader distribution of Brevicollum and Crassiparies\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neohendersoniaceae ITS 24x455","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110513.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neohendersoniaceae combined 46x3195 BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110511.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neohendersoniaceae combined 46x3195 MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110512.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neohendersoniaceae ITS 24x456 MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110514.phy"}]}
