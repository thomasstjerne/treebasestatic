Two new species of the genus are described.\nTwo morphological characters (presence of a median apophysis in the male\npalp and of a tarsal claw in the female palp) suggest it is excluded\nfrom the main clade of salticids (the Salticoida). Sequences of nuclear\nand mitochondrial gene regions (28S, 18S, 16S\u001aND1, CO1), analyzed by\nparsimony and Bayesian methods, agree that Eupoa is a basal\n(non-salticoid) salticid, but fail to find a clear placement. Eupoa may\nrepresent a deep-branching lineage long separate from the lyssomanines,\nspartaeines, and other basal groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Placement of the salticid spider Eupoa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4816.phy"}]}
