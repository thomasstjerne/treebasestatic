In some species, ABC transporters\nmay be involved in the detoxification of substances such as\ninsecticides. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), a\ndestructive pest of cruciferous crops worldwide, is an important species\nto study as it is resistant to many types of insecticides as well as\nbiological control Bacillus thuringiensis toxins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98035","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98035.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98036","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98036.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98039.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98040.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98041.phy"}]}
