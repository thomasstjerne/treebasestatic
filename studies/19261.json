Although in some taxa the asymmetry may be a response to the\nevolution of one-sided, male- above copulation from a more ancestral\nfemale-above condition, in other taxa, such as Mammalia and Coleoptera,\nthis explanation appears insuffi- cient. We carried out an informal\nassessment of genital asymmetry across the Coleoptera and found that\nmale genital asymmetry is present in 43% of all beetle families, and at\nall within-family taxonomic levels. In the most diverse group,\nCucujiformia, however, genital asymmetry is comparatively rare. We also\nreconstructed the phylogeny of the leiodid tribe Cholevini, and mapped\naspects of genital asymmetry on the tree, revealing that endo- phallus\nsclerites, endophallus, median lobe and parameres are, in a nested\nfashion, increasingly unlikely to have evolved asymmetry. We interpret\nthese results in the light of cryptic female choice versus sexually\nantagonistic coevolution and advocate further ways in which the\nphenomenon may be better understood. This article is part of the themed\nissue ‘Provocative questions in left right asymmetry’.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98759.phy"}]}
