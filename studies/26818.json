In Brazil, the knowledge about this genus\ndiversity is restricted to the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Caatinga\nbiomes, where several species have been described in the subgenera\nLactariopsis and Pseudogymnocarpi. In contrast, subgenus Gymnocarpi\nappears poorly diverse in Brazil, until now only being represented by\nLf. panuoides from Amazon. Based on morphology and phylogenetic\nanalysis, three novel species of Lf. subg. Gymnocarpi are described from\nBrazil: Lf. guttulatus, Lf. piperogalactus and Lf. spathuliformis.\nLactifluus lepus, recently described from Caribbean, is reported from\nAmazonian tropical forest. A combined dataset of nuclear rDNA internal\ntranscribed spacer region (ITS) and RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit (rpb2) was analyzed and based on its phylogenetic hypothesis and\nmorphological data, Lf. sect. Piperogalacti is described and the\npleurotoid sect. Panuoidei is emended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactifluus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128414.phy"}]}
