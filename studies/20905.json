Both morphological and\nmolecular data (DNA sequences from the ITS and 28S regions) are used to\ncharacterize and distinguish it from other Tremella s. lat. species.\nTremella anaptychiae is closely related to T. parmeliarum but\ncomparatively distantly related to other previously recognized\nlichenicolous species groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103692.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103693","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103693.phy"}]}
