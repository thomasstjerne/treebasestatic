During our investigations exploring\ncercosporoid fungi associated with leaf spot symptoms of fruit and\nforest trees in northern and north-western Iran, several passalora-like\ninfections were isolated from symptomatic leaves of different trees\nbelonging to the Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Rosaceae and Ulmaceae. A\npolyphasic taxonomic approach by applying molecular data, morphological\nfeatures and host data, was employed to identify the isolates. In a\nmulti-gene phylogenetic analysis (LSU, ITS and RPB2), these isolates\nclustered in four clades in the Mycosphaerellaceae. The revealed taxa\nencompass Paracercosporidium microsorum on Tilia platyphyllos,\nPrathigadoides gleditsiae-caspicae gen. et. sp. nov. on Gleditsia\ncaspica, Pruniphilomyces circumscissus on Prunus avium and Prunus\ncerasus, and Sirosporium celtidis on Celtis australis. The new genus\nPrathigadoides and its type species Prathigadoides gleditsiae-caspicae\nare molecularly distinct from all phylogenetically related genera, and\nsome characteristics of the conidiophores and conidia diï¬€ers from those\nof the morphologically similar species Prathigada condensata on the\nNorth America Gleditsia triacanthos","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131055","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131055.phy"}]}
