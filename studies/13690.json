Representatives are Myxobolus cerebralis, the\ncausative agent of whirling disease in salmonids, and the enigmatic\n“orphan worm” Buddenbrockia plumatellae parasitizing in Bryozoa.\nOriginally, Myxozoa were classified as protists, but later several\nmetazoan characteristics were reported. However, their phylogenetic\nrelationships remained doubtful. Some molecular phylogenetic analyses\nplaced them as sister group to or even within Bilateria, whereas the\npossession of polar capsules that are similar to nematocysts of Cnidaria\nand of minicollagen genes suggest a close relationship between Myxozoa\nand Cnidaria. EST data of Buddenbrockia also indicated a cnidarian\norigin of Myxozoa, but were not sufficient to reject a closer\nrelationship to bilaterians. Phylogenomic analyses of new genomic\nsequences of Myxobolus cerebralis firmly place Myxozoa as sister group\nto Medusozoa within Cnidaria. Based on the new dataset, the alternative\nhypothesis that Myxozoa form a clade with Bilateria can be rejected\nusing topology tests. Sensitivity analyses indicate that this result is\nnot affected by long branch attraction artifacts or compositional\nbias.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myxozoa and Cnidaria","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_59182.phy"}]}
