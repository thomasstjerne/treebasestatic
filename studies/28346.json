Present study covers a new\nwood-inhabiting fungal species that Heteroradulum niveum sp. nov is\nproposed based on a combination of morphological features and molecular\nevidence. The species is characterized by the resupinate basidiomata, a\nmonomitic hyphal system with generative hyphae with clamp connections,\nthe tubular cystidia and two to four-celled basidia, and allantoid,\ncolorless, thin-walled, smooth, IKI, CB, basidiospores (6.513.5 × 2.75.5\nµm). Sequences of ITS and nLSU rRNA gene regions of the studied samples\nwere generated and phylogenetic analyses were per-formed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. These\nphylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS+nLSU showed that H. niveum\nnested in Heteroradulum within Auriculariales. Further study within\nHeteroradulum on the basis of ITS+nLSU dataset re-vealed that it formed\na monophyletic lineage with a strong support (100% BS, 100% BP, 1.00\nBPP) and then grouped with H. yunnanensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131501.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131502.phy"}]}
