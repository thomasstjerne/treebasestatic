In this paper, we\ninvestigate evolutionary relationships within this group using\nmorphological and DNA sequence variation to test the monophyly of the\nHawaiian species (the Tetraplasandra group), generic limits of\nTetraplasandra, Reynoldsia, and Munroidendron, and the validity of\ncurrent classifications. Parsimony analyses using two molecular markers,\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the 5S non-transcribed spacer\n(5S-NTS) of the nuclear rDNA genes, and 39 morphological and anatomical\ncharacters were conducted using all species of Tetraplasandra (excluding\nthe recently resurrected species T. lydgatei), Reynoldsia, and\nMunroidendron, plus three species (four for morphological data) of the\noutgroup genus Gastonia. The results support a monophyletic Hawaiian\nTetraplasandra group, a sister relationship between Munroidendron and R.\nsandwicensis, and a polyphyletic Reynoldsia. Here we build on previous\nmolecular analyses of the Tetraplasandra group and propose the next\nsteps necessary to recognize new generic boundaries. Changes in floral\nmorphology within Tetraplasandra correspond to monophyletic groupings.\nSpecies with hypogynous flowers cluster together and species with floral\ncharacters suggestive of ornithophily cluster together.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, Morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2758.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, Total Evidence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2760.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, Total Evidence","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2759.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, ITS + 5S-NTS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetraplasandra Group, 5S-NTS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2756.phy"}]}
