Each fungus produces a unique\nmixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with an abundant mixture of\nterpenoids analyzed by headspace solidphase microextraction (SPME)\nfiber-GC/MS. These terpenes included α-Muurolene, β-Phellandrene,\nγ-Terpinene, and α-Thujene, as well as other minor terpenoids including\nCaryophyllene, Patchoulene, Cedrene, 2-Carene, and Thujone. The volatile\nmetabolites of each isolate showed antifungal properties against a wide\nrange of plant pathogenic test fungi including Alternaria alternata,\nBotryosphaeria dothidea, Botrytis cinerea, Cercospora asparagi,\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium graminearum, Phytophthora\ncinnamomi Sphaeropsis sapinea Valsa sordida. The growth inhibition of\nthe pathogens varied between 10 to 60 percent within 72 hr of exposure.\nTo our knowledge, the endophytic Diaporthe fungi are first reported from\nCatharanthus roseus. VOCs produced by each strain of the endophytic\nDiaporthe fungi were unique components with dominant monoterpenes\ncomparing to known Diaporthe/Phomopsis fungal VOCs. A discussion is\npresented on the inhibitive bioactivities of secondary metabolites among\nendophytic Diaporthe fungi and this medicinal plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112024","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112024.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112023","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112023.phy"}]}
