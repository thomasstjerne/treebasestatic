In the present study, two new Ganoderma\nspecies were collected from southeastern China and described on the\nbasis of morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses of sequences\nof the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the translation\nelongation factor 1-α gene (EF1-α) and the second subunit of RNA\npolymerase II (RPB2). Specimens of both species were found on living\ntrees of Casuarina equisetifolia. Ganoderma angustisporum sp. nov. is\ncharacterized by its sessile basidiomata and almond-shaped, slightly\ntruncate, narrow basidiospores (911.3 × 45.2 µm). Ganoderma\ncasuarinicola sp. nov. is characterized by its strongly laccate reddish\nbrown pileal surface, luminous yellow to yellowish brown cutis, and\nellipsoid, truncate basidiospores (910.2 × 56 µm). The two new species\nare compared with their related taxa. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed\nthat G. angustisporum and G. casuarinicola are the distinct species\nwithin Ganoderma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111813.phy"}]}
