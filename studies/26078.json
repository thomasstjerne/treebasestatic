In this study, a new Neoconidiobolus\nspecies, N. microconidius is described and illustrated herein. It\ndiffers from other Neoconidiobolus spp. by smallest primary conidia.\nMolecular analysis based on nucLSU+tef1-a+mtSSU dataset revealed that N.\nmicroconidius is related to N. lachnodes, but the latter produces larger\nprimary conidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123082.phy"}]}
