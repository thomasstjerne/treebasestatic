Our\nresults indicate that a fourth, hitherto unknown main phylogenetic\nlineage occurs in Iberia, so that in total, the species is divided into\nsix distinct clades, comprising T. m. mauritanicus, T. m. simplex Ghigi,\nand four as yet unnamed lineages that appear to be endemic to Iberia.\nPercentages of sequence divergence among the main clades in T.\nmauritanicus reach the range reported for recognized species in other\nnotostracan lineages. A thorough morphological investigation also\nrevealed that the differentiation among these lineages is higher than\npreviously thought, and that populations of three of the main clades\nwithin T. mauritanicus can be reliably separated from each other and\nfrom the remaining lineages based on the morphology of adult males. The\nremaining clades also show a significant level of morphological\ndifferentiation, but include a certain proportion of populations for\nwhich the additional application of molecular methods is needed for a\nreliable determination. The geographic distributions of 12S haplotypes\nare indicative of frequent dispersal events and gene flow among\npopulations belonging to the same main lineage, but give no evidence of\nrecent migration events among different main lineages, suggesting that\nthere is no gene flow among the latter. Our data thus suggest that the\nsix main lineages within T. mauritanicus represent distinct species. We\ntherefore describe the Iberian lineages as T. baeticus Korn n. sp., T.\nemeritensis Korn & Pérez-Bote n. sp., T. gadensis Korn &\nGarcía-de-Lomas n. sp., and T. vicentinus Korn, Machado, Cristo &\nCancela da Fonseca n. sp., and reinstate T. simplex Ghigi to full\nspecies status. Our data confirm the general, previously recognized\npattern of a lower dispersal probability in gonochoric Triops taxa.\nHowever, we found evidence that passive dispersal in Triops may be\nfurther complicated by a strong habitat dependence of dispersal\nprobability, mediated by prevailing dispersal vectors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. A1 COI","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7237.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7244.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7242.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S MP StrictConsensus","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7239.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S MP MajRule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7240.phy"},{"tree_label":"second ML Tree 12S 16S","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7243.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule 12S 16S","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7245.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S ML","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triops mauritanicus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7241.phy"}]}
