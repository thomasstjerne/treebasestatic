In flightless Trigonopterus weevils, however, we\nfind 100% endemism for the eight species reported here. Phylogeographic\nanalyses show extensive in-situ differentiation, including a local\nradiation of five species. A comprehensive molecular phylogeny and\nancestral area reconstruction of Indo-Malaysian-Melanesian species\nreveals a complex colonization pattern, where the three Balinese\nlineages all arrived from the East, i.e. all of them transgressed\nWallaceâs Line. Although East Java possesses a rich fauna of\nTrigonopterus, no exchange can be observed with Bali. We assert that the\nbiogeographic picture of Bali has been dominated by the influx of mobile\norganisms from Java, but different relationships may be discovered when\nflightless invertebrates are studied. Our results highlight the\nimportance of in-depth analyses of spatial patterns of\nbiodiversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trigonopterus weevils on Bali","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70601.phy"}]}
