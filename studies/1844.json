A combined gene tree resolved\nseven groups with 100% bootstrap support, suggesting that they are\nmonophyletic groups supported concordantly by all four loci. By\nincorporating biological and morphological species criteria, each of the\nseven groups was considered to be a current species. However,\nphylogenetic relationships among these species were unresolved in the\nsingle-gene trees and in the combined tree. Furthermore, the transition\nfrom concordance to conflict occurred more than once in the combined\ngene tree. They were interpreted by assuming that Pyricularia has\nevolved through repeating species radiation. The transition point other\nthan the current species limit was considered to be the limit of the\nformer species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5d","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2820.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2818.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4d","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2819.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2823.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4c","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2826.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5c","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2827.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2821.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2824.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Speciation in Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2825.phy"}]}
