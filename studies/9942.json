Despite considerable research\nfocusing on the lampropeltinines, a robust phylogeny has thus far proven\nelusive. Here, we infer a new phylogeny for the group including all\nknown extant species based on multiple nuclear and mitochondrial genes,\nand present a revised taxonomy. We also test the hypothesis of a\nPleistocene species pump being responsible for the known taxonomic\ndiversity in the group. We find that diversification of all modern\ngenera and most species took place in the Neogene, rejecting the common\nmodel of a Pleistocene radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lampropeltini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6543.phy"}]}
