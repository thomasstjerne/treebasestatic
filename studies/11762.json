Previous investigations of molluscan phylogeny, based\nprimarily on nuclear ribosomal gene sequences or morphological data have\nbeen unsuccessful at elucidating these relationships. Recently,\nphylogenomic studies employing dozens to hundreds of genes have greatly\nimproved our understanding of deep animal relationships. However,\nlimited genomic resources spanning molluscan diversity has prevented use\nof a phylogenomic approach. Here we use transcriptome and genome data\nfrom all major lineages (except Monoplacophora) and recover a\nwell-supported topology for Mollusca. Our results strongly support the\nAculifera hypothesis placing Polyplacophora (chitons) in a clade with a\nmonophyletic Aplacophora (worm-like molluscs). Additionally, within\nConchifera, a sister-taxon relationship between Gastropoda and Bivalvia\nis supported. This grouping has received little consideration and\ncontains most (>95%) molluscan species. Thus we propose the\nnode-based name Pleistomollusca. In light of these results, we examined\nthe evolution of morphological characters and found support for advanced\ncephalization and shells as possibly having multiple origins within\nMollusca.","trees":[{"tree_label":"sFig. 7BI","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47936.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 10 BI","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47941.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 9BI","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47939.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 6","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47934.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 13","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47922.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 12","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47925.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47923.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 11","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47924.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47928.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 3","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47927.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47935.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 8","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47938.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 7ML","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47937.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 9ML","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47940.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 15","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47944.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 14","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47943.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 10 ML","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47942.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 16b","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47947.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 16a","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deep Molluscan Relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47946.phy"}]}
