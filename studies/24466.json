Most of the species are endemic to Australia,\nbut three species occur on islands in the South Pacific as far east as\nFrench Polynesia and one species is native to Namibia. Here we present\nphylogenetic results based on genome skimming, with near-complete taxon\nsampling and population-level sampling for several species. These\nrepresent the first phylogenetic results for the section that include\nmost recognised taxa, using wild-sourced material wherever possible.\nDespite known chromosome number and genome size changes in the section,\nthere is little divergence in the ribosomal DNA operon (26S, 18.S and\n5.8S plus associated spacers) and plastid genomes, with little to no\ntaxonomic signal in plastome phylogenetic results and clear\nplastid-nuclear discordance. These results contrast with strong\nmorphological differentiation (both floral and vegetative) between most\nof the core Australian taxa and obvious differences in ecological\npreferences. Together these initial results portray Nicotiana section\nSuaveolentes as experiencing recent and ongoing radiation in the arid\nzone of Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nicotiana section Suaveolentes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118029.phy"}]}
