The seven species and seven\nadditional subspecies were considered the terminal taxa. Polarity of the\ncharacters is based on the outgroup comparison method. Eighteen equally\nparsimonious cladograms were produced, each with 32 steps and a\nconsistency index of 0.75. A successive weighting procedure was applied,\nresulting in six cladograms with a consistency index of 0.95. All 24\ncladograms share the following seven monophyletic groups: (1) all\nspecies except C. cordata and C. glabrescens (stipules deciduous); (2)\nthe group of C. mollis, the three subspecies of C. lutetiana and C.\nerubescens (exserted nectary); (3) C. repens and all six subspecies of\nC. alpina (single-seeded fruits, stolons terminated by tubers, and\nviscin threads reduced or absent); (4) the six subspecies of C. alpina\n(unilocular ovaries with no trace of a second locule and tardily opening\nperianth); (5) C. alpina subspecies alpina, micrantha, pacifica, and\nimaicola (flowers opening on ascending to erect pedicels); (6) C. alpina\nsubspecies alpina, micrantha, and pacifica ( translucent leaves); (7) C.\nalpina subspecies alpina and micrantha (glabrous stems) . Results of the\ncladistic analysis support most of the current systematic classification\nof the genus, except for the relationships among the three subspecies of\nC. lutetiana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & H","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1610.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & J","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1608.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & G","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1611.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & F","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1612.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & E","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1613.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C & D","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1614.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & J","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1615.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & H","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1616.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & F","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1617.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & G","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1618.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & E","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1619.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B & D","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1620.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & J","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1621.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & H","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1622.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & G","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1623.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & F","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1624.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & E","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1625.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A & D","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1626.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1627.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Circaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1628.phy"}]}
