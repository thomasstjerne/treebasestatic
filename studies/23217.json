Three data partitions: complete plastomes, rare\ngenomic changes (RGC), and a combined plastome and RGC data matrix were\nanalyzed. Overall, 175 RGC events were identified, and 156 non-ambiguous\nRGC were analyzed, of which 36 total synapomorphic RGC were identified\nand attributed to either the Group 1 subtribes: Aveninae, Agrostidinae,\nand Anthoxanthinae; or the Group 2 subtribes: Loliinae, Ammochloinae,\nParapholiinae, Dactylidinae, Poinae, and Coleanthinae. There were two\nRGC events in which convergence/parallelism was seen in our trees. Two\nother RGC originated through intrastrand deletion events. The remaining\nRGC events likely originated through recombination given their size and\nlack of sequence evidence for other types of mutations. This study also\ndetermined that relationships between taxa, even those only weakly\nsupported in previous studies, could be inferred with strong support\nwhen utilizing complete plastomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pooideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113421.phy"}]}
