Although some additional gene losses have occurred, gene\nadditions to angiosperm plastomes were previously unknown. Plastomes in\nthe Campanulaceae sensu lato have incorporated dozens of large, open\nreading frames (ORFs; putative protein-coding genes). These insertions\napparently caused many of the 125+ large inversions now known in this\nsmall dicot clade. This phylogenetically restricted phenomenon is not\nbiogeographically localized, which indicates that these ORFs came from\nthe nucleus or (less likely) a cryptic endosymbiont.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Deltran Phylogram","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanulaceae sensu lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75044.phy"},{"tree_label":"Chronogram","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanulaceae sensu lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75045.phy"}]}
