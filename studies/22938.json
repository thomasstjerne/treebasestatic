We collected a sulcispora-like\ntaxon on leaves of Anthoxanthum odoratum L. in Italy and obtained single\nascospore isolates. Combined LSU, SSU and ITS gene sequence analysis\nconfirmed that Sulcispora should be placed in the family\nPhaeosphaeriaceae and newly collected Sulcispora species is introduced\nhere as S. supratumidus. Detailed descriptions and illustrations are\nprovided for Sulcispora supratumidus and it is compared with the type\nspecies, Sulcispora pleurospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112425","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112425.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112426","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112426.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112422","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112422.phy"}]}
