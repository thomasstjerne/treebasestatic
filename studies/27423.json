Strain HX-140 was able to produce protease,\ncellulase, Î²-1,3-glucanase and antifungal volatile organic compounds. An\nin vitro dual culture test showed that strain HX-140 exhibited broad\nspectrum antifungal activity against soil-borne plant pathogenic fungi.\nStrain HX-140also reduced the infection of Fusarium wilt of cucumber\nseedlings by 55.6% in a greenhouse pot experiment. A field plot\nexperiment confirmed the biocontrol effects and further revealed that\nantifungal activity was positively correlated with inoculum size by the\nroot-irrigation method. Here, inoculums at 106, 107 and 108 cfu/mL of\nHX-140 bacterial suspension reduced the incidence of Fusarium wilt of\ncucumber seedling by 19.5%, 41.1%, and 50.9%, respectively. Taken\ntogether, our results suggest that P. polymyxa HX-140 has significant\npotential in the control of Fusarium wilt and potentially other fungal\ndiseases of cucumber.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127939","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127939.phy"}]}
