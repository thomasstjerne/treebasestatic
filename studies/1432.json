A\nphylogenetic hypothesis invoking multiple transitions between mating\nsystems has been proposed for Leavenworthia, but this hypothesis has not\nbeen subject to molecular phylogenetic analysis. DNA sequence variation\nfrom four non-coding chloroplast regions (the trnL intron; and the\ntrnT-trnL, trnL-trnF, and psbA-trnH intergenic spacers) was used to\nreconstruct the generic phylogeny, to test the validity of several\nproposed species, and to assess the number of mating system transitions\nwithin the genus. The strict consensus tree largely reflected the\nlong-standing phylogenetic hypothesis for Leavenworthia, although\nadditional data are needed to fully validate the recognition of L.\ncrassa and L. alabamica. Unexpected results included the placement of L.\nuniflora as sister to the rest of the genus, and the apparent\nhybridization between L. exigua and L. torulosa. Finally, our data\nstrongly supported a minimum of three mating system transitions within\nLeavenworthia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia Strict Consensus Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2291.phy"}]}
