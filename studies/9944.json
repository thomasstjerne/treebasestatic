Phylogenetic\nanalyses of morphological characters reveal eight non-homoplasious\nsynapomorphies supporting the monophyly of the genus: absence of roots,\novary surrounded by stem tissue during and after anthesis, ovary\nhorizontal at anthesis, unilocular mature ovary, asymmetrically inflated\npedicel apex, anisolobous ovary, ovary longitudinal axis at 45-90° angle\nrelative to pedicel axis, and one deciduous capsule valve. Five species\nand two forms are recognized: Castelnavia fluitans, C. monandra, C.\nmultipartita (C. m. forma multipartita, C. m. forma pendulosa C.T.\nPhilbrick & C.P. Bove), C. noveloi, and C. princeps. Four species\naccepted by earlier authors are placed in synonymy. The morphology and\necology of the genus is discussed, and species descriptions,\nillustrations, a distribution map, lists of specimens examined, and a\nkey to species are presented. Castelnavia occurs primarily in Brazil\nwith one species in Bolivia. Greatest species diversity is in the\nBrazilian states of Mato Grosso, Pará and Tocantins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Castelnavia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6508.phy"}]}
