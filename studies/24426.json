Maximum-likelihood and\nBayesian phylogeny proved Elbamycella gen. nov. as a distinct genus\nwithin Juncigenaceae. The new genus has been compared with closely\nrelated genera and is characterised by a unique suite of characters,\nsuch as ascospores with polar appendages and peculiar shape and\ndimension of ascomata and asci.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elbamycella rosea MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_117988.phy"}]}
