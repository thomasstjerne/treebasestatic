In this study, G. splendens isolates\nfrom seven Prefectures in Japan, were characterized on their morphology,\nmating compatibility, and molecular phylogeny based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer region of ribosomal RNA gene, and mitochondrial\ncytochrome oxidase 1 and 2 gene regions. They were also examined\nvirulence on geranium and papaya which known to be host plants of G.\nsplendens. All G. splendens isolates had similar morphology and optimal\ngrowth temperatures. Mating compatibility test revealed that all G.\nsplendens isolates from Okinawa and Kagoshima Pref. were antheridial\nisolates. While, the all isolates from the other regions were oogonial\nisolates. The virulence on geranium and papaya significantly differed\namong the isolates. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of\nthree regions showed that G. splendens isolates were separated into two\nphylogenetic groups. Our study indicates that molecular intraspecific\nvariation of G. splendens is widely distributed in Japan, and it had no\ncorrelation with morphology, mating types and virulence to host\nplants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105269","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105269.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105268.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105270","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105270.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105271","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105271.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105272","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105272.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105273","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105273.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105274","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105274.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105267","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_105267.phy"}]}
