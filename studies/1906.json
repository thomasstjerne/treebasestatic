The species remained hidden from the attention of\nsubsequent workers until acquiring new relevance in the context of\nmolecular-biogeographic work on Cucurbitaceae. Based on molecular data,\nit is the sister to all Sicyeae, a New World clade of about 125 species\nin 16 genera. We here place this species in a new genus, Linnaeosicyos,\ndescribe and illustrate it based on new collections, and discuss its\nphylogenetic context using molecular and morphological data. Judging\nfrom Dominican amber, elements of the flora of Hispaniola date back at\nleast 30 my, and the occurrence on the island of five endemic species of\nCucurbitaceae (Linnaeosicyos amara from Benincaseae, Melothria\ndomingensis from Sicyeae, Sicana fragrans from Cucurbiteae, and the\nsister species Anacaona sphaerica and Penelopeia suburceolata also from\nCucurbiteae) points to its long occupation by Cucurbitaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Linnaeosicyos, combined plastid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4957.phy"}]}
