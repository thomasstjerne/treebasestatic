However, some genera in\nOmphalotaceae have not reached a stable concept that reflects\nmonophyletic groups with identifiable morphological circumscription.\nThis is the case of Gymnopus and Marasmiellus, which have been the\ntarget of two opposing views: 1) a more inclusive Gymnopus encompassing\nMarasmiellus; or 2) a more restricted Gymnopus (s.str.) while\nMarasmiellus remains a distict genus; both genera still awaiting a more\nconclusive phylogenetic hypothesis coupled with morphological\nrecognition. Furthermore, some new genera or undefined clades need more\nstudy. In the present paper, a phylogenetic study was conducted based on\nnrITS and nrLSU in single and multilocus analyses including members of\nthe Omphalotaceae, more specifically of the genera belonging to the\n/letinuloid clade. The resulting trees support the view of a more\nrestricted Gymnopus and a distinct Marasmiellus based on monophyletic\nand strongly supported clades on which their morphological\ncircumscripions and taxonomic treatments are proposed herein. The\nresults also provide evidence for the description of two new genera:\nParagymnopus and Pusillomyces. Pusillomyces manuripioides sp. nov. (type\nspecies of the genus) is described with morphological description,\ntaxonomic and ecological remarks, and illustrations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"217","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Omphalotaceae Align LSU data all 4 NNN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117327.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"244","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Omphalotaceae Align ITS LSU add 2 fix 7 NNN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117326.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"527","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Omphalotaceae Align ITS data all NNN","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117325.phy"}]}
