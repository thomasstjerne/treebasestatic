The placement of Shuaria in the tribe\nBeslerieae is strongly supported by molecular sequence data generated\nfrom analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer\nregion (ITS), and the chloroplast DNA trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic\nspacer region. Sequence data were generated for 33 species representing\nmost of the generic diversity from the tribes Beslerieae and\nNapeantheae. Shuaria is characterized by the following unique\ncombination of relatively uncommon characters in the Gesneriaceae:\narborescent habit; opposite leaf arrangement sometimes interrupted by\nalternate leaves; lepidote trichomes on vegetative and floral\nstructures; small white flowers with a dorsal gibbosity at the base of\nthe corolla tube; and a bivalved septicidally dehiscent capsule. The\nsuite of uncommon characters initially made Shuaria difficult to place\nin the Gesneriaceae and within a known tribe. Shuaria is restricted to\nthe Ecuadorian provinces of Pastaza, Morona-Santiago and\nZamora-Chinchipe in lowland Amazonian tropical wet forest and in lower\nmontane cloud forest on the western slopes of the Cordillera del Cóndor.\nA key and a table are presented for differentiating Shuaria from other\nrelated genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gesneriaceae, ITS trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6771.phy"}]}
