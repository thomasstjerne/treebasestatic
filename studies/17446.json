Podosphaera, is described and illustrated on Pyrus\nussuriensis in China. P. paracurvispora differs from P. clandestina and\nP. leucotricha which are common causal agents of Pyrus powdery mildew in\nhaving crescent-shaped ascospores, and differs from P. curvispora,\nendemic in Japan on Sorbus spp., in having much broader pale brown\nascospores. Phylogenetic analyses based on rDNA ITS and partial 28S rDNA\nsequences clearly support P. paracurvispora as species of its own,\ngenetically well separated from the others. The morphological\ncharacteristics and phylogenetic results strongly suggest that the\nfungus is a new, undescribed species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podosphaera 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119089.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podosphaera ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119088.phy"}]}
