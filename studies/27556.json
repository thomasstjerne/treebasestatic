Four species, Haploporus bicolor, H.\nlongisporus, H. punctatus and H. srilankensis, are described as new\nspecies based on morphology and molecular phylogenetic analyses inferred\nfrom the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the large subunit nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small subunit mitochondrial rRNA gene\n(mtSSU). Haploporus bicolor is characterized by the distinctly different\ncolors between the pore surface and the tubes, small pores measuring 57\nper mm, and narrow basidiospores measuring 10.511.9 × 4.55 µm; H.\nlongisporus differs from other species in the genus by its large pores\nmeasuring 23 per mm, hyphae at dissepiment edge with simple septum, and\nthe long basidiospores (up to 22 µm); H. punctatus is distinguished by\nits cushion-shaped basidiocarps, wide fusiform cystidioles with a simple\nseptum at tips, the absence of dendrohyphidia and the cylindrical to\nslightly allantoid basidiospores measuring 910.8 × 3.85 µm; H.\nsrilankensis is characterized by its perennial habit, small pores\nmeasuring 45 per mm, dextrinoid skeletal hyphae, the presence of\ncystidioles and dendrohyphidia. An identification key to accepted\nspecies of Haploporus is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haploporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131917.phy"}]}
