To test this hypothesis, a phylogeny of the Baculoviridae,\nincluding 39 viruses from hosts of the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera and\nHymenoptera, was reconstructed based on sequences from the genes lef-8\nand ac22. The tree showed a clear division of the baculoviruses\naccording to the order of their hosts. This division highlighted the\nneed to reconsider the classification of the baculoviruses to include\none or possibly two new genera. Furthermore, the specialisation of\ndistinct virus lineages to particular insect orders suggests ancient\ncoevolutionary interactions between baculoviruses and their hosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLGVtopo","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Baculoviridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1688.phy"}]}
