Taxa identification was\naccomplished through observation of morphological characteristics of\ntheir mature, sporulating and undeformed basidiocarps. The genetic\ndiversity of the collections was investigated by using internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS1/4) of ribosomal DNA sequences comparisons. Both\nanalyses showed that the 75 collections clustered into six clades,\nnamely, G. applanatum, G. adspersum, G. resinaceum, G. pfeifferi, G.\nlucidum and G. carnosum in accordance with the morphospecies concept.\nThe sequence comparison demonstrated genetic homogeneity of all G.\nresinaceum clade. Multiple sequence alignment indicated the presence of\ntwo G. resinaceum sequence types with significant statistic support and,\nprobably, the existence of two cryptic taxa. The twenty-eight\ncollections clustered with G. applanatum group and the twenty other\ncollections were grouped with morphologically very similar G. adspersum\ngroup. ITS sequences show, however, no close similarity between\nthem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ganoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121829.phy"}]}
