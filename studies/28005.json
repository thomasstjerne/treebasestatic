Hyde, a later homonym of D.\ndorycnii (Mont.) Sacc. Diaporthe forlicesenica as well as the species D.\ngoulteri have so far only been described in their asexual morphs. In\nthis study, the sexual morphs for these species are recovered for the\nfirst time, from dead branches and twigs in Italy and Thailand. The\nsexual-asexual morph connections of the species are confirmed by DNA\nsequence based phylogenies including the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS), translation elongation factor-1α (tef1), β-tubulin (tub2),\nhistone H3 (his) and calmodulin (cal) loci. Detailed descriptions,\nillustrations and molecular data for the taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"273","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129991.phy"}]}
