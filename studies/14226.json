Both\nspecies are closely related to the Heterobasidion insulare complex in\nmorphology, but they differ in presence of cystidia and amyloid skeletal\nhyphae in the context. Phylogenetically, the combined RPB1 and RPB2\nsequence data supports H. amyloideum and H. tibeticum as two distinct\nspecies within the H. insulare complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76289.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76290.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76288.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76285.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76286.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76287.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterobasidion","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76291.phy"}]}
