Phylogenetic studies have arrived at\ndifferent conclusions as to the recognition of species in the genus, but\nin a recent study based on the analyses of six nuclear markers (genes or\nnoncoding regions) of a worldwide sample of Thamnolia, we showed the\nexistence of three well-supported lineages with two different\nchemistries and geographical distributions. Here, we supply two analyses\nbased on ITS and three markers, respectively, which were extended from\nthe study mentioned above to include type specimens and additional\nThamnolia strains and taxa. In these analyses the same three clades were\nretrieved. A putative DEAD-box helicase is used here for the first time\nas an informative phylogenetic marker to provide taxonomic resolution at\nspecies level. The distribution of morphological and chemical characters\nacross the phylogeny was analyzed and it was concluded that three\nmorphologically cryptic, but genetically well supported, species occur:\nT. vermicularis s. str., T. subuliformis s. str. and T. tundrae sp. nov.\nThamnolia vermicularis s. str. contains individuals with uniform\nsecondary chemistry (producing thamnolic acid) and a rather limited\ndistribution in the European Alps, Tatra Mts and the Western\nCarpathians, a distribution which might result from glacial survival in\nan adjacent refugium/refugia. Thamnolia subuliformis s. str. is widely\ndistributed in all hemispheres and the samples contain two chemotypes\n(either with thamnolic or squamatic acids). Thamnolia tundrae is\ndescribed as new; it produces baeomycesic and squamatic acids, and has a\ndistribution limited to the arctic tundra of Eurasia extending to the\nAleutian Islands in North America. It may have survived the latest\nglaciation in coastal refugia near its present distribution. Thus,\nsecondary chemistry alone is not suitable for characterizing species in\nThamnolia, secondary chemistry and geographical origin are informative,\nand the ITS region can be confidently used for species recognition.\nNomenclatural notes are given on several other names that have been used\nin Thamnolia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bootrep9","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107432","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107432.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107466","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107466.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107424","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107424.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep2","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107425","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107425.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep3","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107426","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107426.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep4","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107427","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107427.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep5","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107428","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107428.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep6","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107429","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107429.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep7","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107430","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107430.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep8","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107431","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107431.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep10","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107433","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107433.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep11","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107434","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107434.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep12","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107435","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107435.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep13","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107436","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107436.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep14","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107437","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107437.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep15","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107438","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107438.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep16","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107439.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep17","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107440","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107440.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep18","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107441","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107441.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep19","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107442","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107442.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep20","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107443","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107443.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep21","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107444","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107444.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep22","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107445","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107445.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep23","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107446","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107446.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep24","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107447.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep25","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107448","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107448.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep26","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107449.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep27","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107450","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107450.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep28","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107451","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107451.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep29","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107452","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107452.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootrep500","ntax":"87",
