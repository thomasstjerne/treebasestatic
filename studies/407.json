Existing evolutionary hypotheses for\nthese organisms have frequently been based on interpretation of one or\nfew key structural or life history features. We used nuclear-encoded\nsmall (1,764 characters) and large subunit (757 characters) ribosomal\nDNA sequences to estimate the phylogeny of representative taxa from this\nsuperfamily. Trees inferred by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood\nmethods strongly support clades that are primarily consistent with one\nrecent classification of the group. In contrast, most previously\nproposed phylogenetic hypotheses were significantly worse when compared\nto the maximum likelihood tree by a statistical method. Hypotheses for\nthe evolution of morphological and life history characters were explored\nby parsimony mapping these features on several tree topologies,\nincluding optimal molecular trees and alternative topologies reflecting\ntraditional expectations deemed not worse in statistical tests. The\nresults identify some consistent putative shared-derived morphological\nfeatures, but also strongly suggest that some key features emphasized by\nprevious workers represent ancestral states or highly homoplastic\ncharacters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3399.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3400.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3384.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3385.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3.1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3387.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3.2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3392.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.6","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3389.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3394.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3390.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4.1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3.3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3393.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3395.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4.2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3397.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4.3","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3398.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascaridoidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3382.phy"}]}
