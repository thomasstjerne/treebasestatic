A fundamental aim in community ecology is to elucidate\nthe processes structuring communities. The key to understanding\ncommunity patterns is to account for species differences and\nsimilarities in how they respond to large scale environmental gradients\nand partition local resources. Using phylogenetic relationships as a\nrepresentation of speciesÂ’ ecological differences, we use phylogenetic\nbeta-diversity (PBD) to examine how patterns of community relatedness\nchange across space.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PhyloBayes+","ntax":"600","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rocky Mountain angiosperm communities, PhyloBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85668.phy"},{"tree_label":"bpcomp+","ntax":"600","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rocky Mountain angiosperm communities, bpcomp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85669.phy"},{"tree_label":"ultrametric","ntax":"661","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rocky Mountain angiosperm communities, ultrametric","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85670.phy"},{"tree_label":"non-ultrametric+","ntax":"661","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rocky Mountain angiosperm communities,\nnon-ultrametric","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85667.phy"}]}
