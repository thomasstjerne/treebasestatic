The genomic characterization of these lineages will be\ninstrumental in order to shed light on their ecological significance and\nphysiology, and to provide an overall insight on the genomic diversity\nand evolution of the archaeal Domain of life. In a recent issue of ISME\nJournal, Kozubal and co-workers described a metagenomic approach that\nthey used to obtain the composite genome of a ‘novel archaeal lineage 1’\n(NAG1), isolated from a high-temperature acidic iron mat in Yellowstone\nNational Park (Kozubal et al, 2013). Based on phylogenetic analysis of\nselected marker genes, Kozubal et al. concluded that NAG1 represented a\nnovel phylum (‘Geoarchaeota’) in the Domain Archaea. Although we want to\nstress that we value the overall findings presented by Kozubal et al in\nterms of provided insights in metabolic and physiological capacities of\nthe NAG1 lineage, we would like to contest the claim that NAG1\nrepresents a novel phylum in the Archaea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood for 33 ribosomal proteins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69295.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood for 33 RP least biased sites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69296.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood for 33 RP most biased sites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69297.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1F","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian for concatenated 16S and 23S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69292.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood for 25 non-ribosomal proteins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69293.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1E","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood for 57 conserved proteins","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69294.phy"}]}
