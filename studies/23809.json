Since\nthen, the disease has occurred on imported plants and in recent years,\nalso on older plants in chateau gardens and parks. At present, the\nexistence of two genotypes of Calonectria pseudonaviculata is known on\nthe European continent. Preventive measures are often not sufficient to\ncontrol this disease, therefore chemical management needs to be\nincluded. It is important to distinguish the genetic clades for targeted\nchemical control. We have focused on phylogenetic determination of four\nisolates of Calonectria pseudonaviculata collected from chateau gardens\nin the Czech Republic by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. It was\npossible to determine both phylogenetic species within the betaÂ–tubulin\ngene sequence. Showing presence of both phylogenetical species in the\nCzech Republic with the dominating clade Calonectria henricotiae. This\nstatement was supported by term tolerance tests on mycelia growth of\nboth clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115938.phy"}]}
