The former species\nstands out as one of the most variable demosponges, and is very similar\nin spicule complement and in the chemistry of secondary metabolites to\nthe Mediterranean/eastern Atlantic C. crambe, type species of Crambe.\nThe aim of the present study was to revise the genus Monanchora in the\nTropical Western Atlantic. In addition, we revisit critically the\nmonophyly of the later genera. MLBI analyses of 28S and 16S rRNA of\nCrambe and Monanchora, and a redescription of the “M. arbuscula complex”\nrevealed three species: M. arbuscula s.s., M. paulista, sp. nov. and a\nnew species of Acarnidae  Iophon parvachela, sp. nov. Three other new\nspecies from the TWA previously assigned to Monanchora were revealed by\nmorphological analyses only, and are also described: M. bahamensis, sp.\nnov., M. megasigmifera, sp. nov. and a new species of Chondropsidae ‒\nBatzella catarinensis, sp. nov. A key for species identification is\nfurnished. Our results suggest that the Eastern Brazil and the\nSoutheastern Brazil ecoregions may represent centers of diversity for\nMonanchora in the TWA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Maximum\nlikelihood","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Bayeasian\ninference","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105598","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105598.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Maximum\nlikelihood","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105594.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Bayeasian\ninference","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Maximum\nlikelihood","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Bayeasian\ninference","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Bayeasian\ninference","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105596","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Monanchora arbuscula complex, 16S rDNA, Bayeasian\ninference","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105597.phy"}]}
