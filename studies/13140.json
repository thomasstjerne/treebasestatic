The specimen comes from the upper Elliot\nFormation (?Hettangian) of Ha Ralekoala (Lesotho) and represents a\nnewspecies: Ignavusaurus rachelis genus et species nova. Acladistic\nanalysis suggests that Ignavusaurus is more derived than\nThecodontosaurusÂ–Pantydraco, but more primitive than Efraasia.\nIgnavusaurus indeed shares a number of unambiguous synapomorphies with\nthe taxa more derived than Thecodontosaurus-Pantydraco, such as a fully\nopen acetabulum, but it is more plesiomorphic than Efraasia andmore\nderived sauropodomorphs as shown by the evidence of, for instance, the\ndistal extremity of its tibia that is is longer (cranio-caudally) than\nwide (latero-medially). The discovery of Ignavusaurus increases the\nknown diversity of the early sauropodomorph fauna of the upper Elliot\nFormation, which stands as one of the richest horizons in the world in\nthis respect.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sauropodomorpha results","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55672.phy"}]}
