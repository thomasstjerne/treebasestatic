Descriptions of new chytridiomycete\norders are based on molecular and ultrastructural characters, which have\nbeen phylogenetically mutually supportive. The Polychytrium clade\nhas consisted of a few chitinophilic, soil and aquatic chytrids that\nclustered in phylogenetic hypotheses but have not been placed in a new\norder. We isolated additional putative members of this clade, sequenced\ntheir nucSSU and nucLSU rDNA and examined zoospores of some of the\nisolates with TEM. Our isolates are in a well-supported clade with\nprevious Polychytrium clade members, but zoospore ultrastructural\ntypes vary within the clade, with characters that often are conserved\nwithin other orders (e.g.Â flagellar plug, rumposome) being either\npresent or absent. Based on the isolates in culture we describe the\nPolychytrium clade as the Polychytriales. This order contains\nPolychytrium, Lacustromyces, Karlingiomyces, two\nnew genera (Arkaya and Neokarlingia) and additional\nundescribed taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46470.phy"}]}
