The type\nspecies of the genus Caldesia is excluded from this monophylum. These\nresults are unsurprising in the light of morphological characteristics,\nbut require three new combinations in Albidella to render both Albidella\nand Caldesia monophyletic. These new combinations are provided here.\nUnder the new circumscription, Albidella shows a disjunct distribution\npattern, with one species in the Caribbean region and three species\ndistributed from tropical Africa and along the margins of the Indian\nOcean to Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albidella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101347.phy"},{"tree_label":"parsimony strict","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Albidella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101348.phy"}]}
