T. globosa is characterized by\nmucedinoid, pale to dark brown basidiocarps adherent to the substrate,\ngenerative hyphae with clamps and rarely with simple septa and\nechinulate globose basidiospores (echinuli up to 1.5 μm long). T.\nlammiensis is characterized by mucedinoid, oxide yellow to golden brown\nbasidiocarps separable from the substrate, generative hyphae with clamps\nand echinulate ellipsoid, triangular or lobbed basidiospores (echinuli\nup to 2 μm long). T. longisterigmata is characterized by mucedinoid,\ndark brown to chestnut basidiocarps separable from the substrate,\ngenerative hyphae clamped and rarely with simple septa, the long\nbasidial sterigmata (711 μm long) and echinulate globose basidiospores\n(echinuli up to 2 μm long). An absence of rhizomorphs and cystidia is\ntheir common morphological feature. Molecular analyses by maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis confirm the\nphylogenetic position of these three new species. The discriminating\ncharacters of these new species and their closely related species are\ndiscussed in this study. A key to the species from Finland is provided\nin order to facilitate future studies of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentella from Finland","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112356.phy"}]}
