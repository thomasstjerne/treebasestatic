Plants responded to these oscillations with repeated\nchanges in their abundance and geographical distribution. However,\noscillating shifts in geographical distribution have only rarely been\nreported in molecular analyses of genetic variation across the EAS.\nHomogyne, a genus endemic to the EAS, contains three species. While H.\ndiscolor and H. sylvestris are confined to the periphery of the Eastern\nAlps, H. alpina is widespread across the EAS. In phylogenetic\nreconstructions of a broad sample of Homogyne using DNA sequence data\nsets of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), plastid\nDNA (ndhF-rpl32, rpl32-trnL, psbA-trnH) and genotyping-by-sequencing\n(GBS), accessions of H. alpina from the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mts.\nform a clade which groups in conflicting positions. While the exact\nrelationship of this Pyrenean/Cantabrian clade of H. alpina remains\nunclear, our data clearly imply that this clade is a lineage distinct\nfrom the remaining accessions of H. alpina (H. alpina s.str.). An\nancestral area analysis unambiguously revealed the Eastern Alps as the\nancestral area of the genus. Considering that relationships within H.\nalpina s.str. clearly illustrate East to West expansion, the\nidentification of a Pyrenean/Cantabrian clade implies that westward\nexpansion from an ancestral area in the Eastern Alps took place twice in\nthe genus. Although the extant distributions of the Pyrenean/Cantabrian\nclade and H. alpina s.str. are mutually exclusive, plastid DNA evidence\nmay imply past contact and hybridization between the two clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111540.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne cpDNA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111547.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne cpDNA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111548.phy"},{"tree_label":"SVDQuartets","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne GBS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111550.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne GBS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111549.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111541.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Homogyne GBS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111551.phy"}]}
