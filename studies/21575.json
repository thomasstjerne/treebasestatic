The oomycete Phytophthora\ninfestans, the potato blight agent, is a largely biotrophic pathogen\nthat feeds from living host cells, which become necrotic only late in\ninfection. The related oomycete Pythium ultimum grows saprophytically in\nsoil and as a necrotroph in plants, causing massive tissue destruction.\nTo learn what distinguishes their lifestyles, we compared their gene\ncontents and expression patterns in media and a shared host, potato\ntuber. Results: Genes related to pathogenesis varied in temporal\nexpression pattern, mRNA level, and family size between the species. A\nfamilyâ€™s aggregate expression during infection was not proportional to\nsize due to transcriptional remodeling and pseudogenization. Ph.\ninfestans had more stage-specific genes, while Py. ultimum tended\ntowards more constitutive expression. Ph. infestans expressed more genes\nencoding secreted cell wall-degrading enzymes, but other categories such\nas secreted proteases and ABC transporters had higher transcript levels\nin Py. ultimum. Species-specific genes were identified including new\nPythium genes, perforins, which may disrupt plant membranes. Genome-wide\northolog analyses identified substantial diversified expression, which\ncorrelated with sequence divergence. Pseudogenization was associated\nwith gene family expansion, especially in gene clusters. Conclusion:\nThis first large-scale analysis of transcriptional divergence within\noomycetes revealed major shifts in genome composition and expression,\nincluding subfunctionalization within gene families. Biotrophy and\nnecrotrophy seem determined by species-specific genes and the varied\nexpression of shared pathogenicity factors, which may be useful targets\nfor crop protection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora infestans and Pythium ultimum","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106965.phy"}]}
