In this\nstudy, we describe a new species of Thecaphora from Oxalis lanata var.\nrosea (Oxalidaceae) in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa.\nMolecular phylogenetic reconstructions based on large subunit ribosomal\nDNA sequence data confirmed the generic placement of the fungus and\nconfirmed that it represents an undescribed species for which the name\nT. capensis sp. nov. is provided. The closest known sister species of\nthe new taxon is T. oxalidis that infects the fruits of Oxalis spp. in\nEurope, Asia and the Americas. In contrast, T. capensis produces\nteliospores within the anthers of its host. This is the first documented\ncase of an anther-smut from an African species of Oxalis and the first\nThecaphora species described from Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thecaphora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_378.phy"}]}
