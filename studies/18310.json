The analyses revealed a relationship to the Stictidaceae lineage\nof the Ostropales. Cyanodermella asteris grows in standard fungal growth\nmedia as a fluffy, pink filamentous fungus. Asexual and sexual\nsporulation has not been observed on media or in the plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae MLT 18S rDNA MEGA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103646.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae MLT RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103647.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae MLT rDNA and RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103643.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae MLT 28S rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103644.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stictidaceae MLT ITS without overhangs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103645.phy"}]}
