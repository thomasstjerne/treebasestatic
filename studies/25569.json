The shape of its\nascospores is similar to that of P. lunatus, but differs from it by\nhaving an asexual state. This new species differs from P. ater by having\na sexual state. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated ITS rDNA,\nLSU rDNA and partial translation elongation factor alpha 1 gene datasets\nalso confirmed the generic placement in Pithoascus and showed its close\nphylogenetic relationships to P. ater and P. lunatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pithoascus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121810.phy"}]}
