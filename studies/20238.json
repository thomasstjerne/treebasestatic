A number of Colletotrichum\nspecies are known to be pathogens of strawberry. A survey of strawberry\nfields in eight provinces of China was carried out to identify the\ncausal agents of strawberry anthracnose. The disease mainly causes crown\nrot, leading to plant wilt and death in the nursery stage, after\ntransplanting in green house, which makes anthracnose a major threat to\nstrawberry production and quality. Multi-locus sequence analysis coupled\nwith morphological assessment revealed that the disease-associated taxa\nbelong to two Colletotrichum species complexes: Colletotrichum nymphaeae\n(C. acutatum species complex), C. fructicola and C. chengpingense sp.\nnov.(C. gloeosporioides species complex). The novel species is\nintroduced in this paper and illustrated. The new species is closely\nrelated to C. theobromicola and pathogenicity tests proved that it is\npathogenic to the strawberry crown, fruits and leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100003.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100028.phy"}]}
