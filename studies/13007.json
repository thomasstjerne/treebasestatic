Bulbs, harvested in July, were asymptomatic. After the drying\nprocess in the drying sheds, about thirty percent of bulbs appeared\nemptied and softened. Fusarium proliferatum was consistently recovered\nfrom infected bulbs. The morphological identification was confirmed by\nTranslation Elongation Factor 1-alpha gene sequencing. Koch postulates\nwere checked through a pathogenicity test. The disease has already been\nreported in Serbia, Germany, Spain, United States, China and India, but\nto our knowledge this is the first report of F. proliferatum garlic bulb\nrot in Italy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium proliferatum, TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_55239.phy"}]}
