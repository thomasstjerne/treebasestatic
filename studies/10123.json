Their collariate\nlamellae, broadly cylindrical to utriform cheilocystidia and\ntrichodermal pileus covering distinguish them morphologically from other\nspecies in sect. Piloselli, while nrITS and EF1-a sequences distinguish\nthem from each other. Leucoagaricus erythrophaeus has been known under\nthe name Lepiota roseifolia, but the type collection of this species\ndoes not fit the interpretation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piloselli","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6648.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Piloselli","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6494.phy"}]}
