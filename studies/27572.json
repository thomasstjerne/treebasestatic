Basing on morphological\nobservations of R. ophiocomae, large and small forms of males and\nfemales, probably, corresponding to closely related species can be\ndistinguished. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the\ncomplete mt genomes of two R. ophiocomae forms and reconstruct the\nphylogenetic relationship of Orthonectida to test the hypothesis that R.\nophiocomae has diverged into two closely related species using the mt\ngenomes. The mt genomes of R. ophiocomae small and R. ophiocomae large\nwere 17,683 bp and 17,868â€‰bp in length, respectively. Most of the\ntypical mitochondrial genes were determined in both species. Complete mt\nnucleotide sequence comparison revealed that sequence identity makes up\nonly 78%. Comparative analyses of mt genome organization revealed that\nthis two forms of R. ophiocomae possess identical arrangements of\nprotein coding genes, while the order and quantity of tRNA and ORFs are\ndifferent. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses indicated that R.\nophiocomae consist of the two novel closely related species. The\nfindings indicate that we observe the process of unique case of new\nspecies formation by evolution and divergence of R. ophiocomae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhopalura ophiocomae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131918.phy"}]}
