Andina elata and A. granulosa are transferred\nfrom Pseudocrossidium, A. coquimbensis, A. oedocostata, and A. pruinosa\nfrom Didymodon, and A. churchilliana and A. limensis are newly\ndescribed. The genus can be distinguished from all other Pottiaceae by\nthe combination of absence of hyalodermis in the stem, axillary hairs\nwith brownish basal cells, cucullate leaf apices, strongly recurved to\nrevolute leaves with margins infolded in the apex, red to orange\ncoloration of the lamina when exposed to potassium hydroxide, ventral\ncostal outgrowths differentiated as a pad of bulging and papillose\ncells, filaments, or lamellae, and upper laminal cells usually bulging\non both sides. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of plastid DNA\nsequences (trnL-trnF and trnG) were undertaken to estimate the\nphylogenetic position of the new genus. The molecular data suggest a\nclose relationship of Andina to the genera Gertrudiella and Didymodon\nwith which it shares a common ancestor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Andina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48996.phy"}]}
