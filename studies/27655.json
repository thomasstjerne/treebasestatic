Morphological comparison was conducted between the two new\nspecies and their closely related ones which verified the phylogenetic\nresults. The two novel species were described and illustrated here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132609.phy"}]}
