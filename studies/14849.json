Here, we present\nthe midgut transcriptome of larval Anoplophora glabripennis, a\nwood-boring beetle with documented lignin-, cellulose-, and\nhemicellulose- degrading capabilities, which provides valuable insights\ninto how this insect overcomes challenges associated with feeding in\nwoody tissue. Transcripts from putative protein coding regions of over\n9,000 insect-derived genes were identified in the A. glabripennis midgut\ntranscriptome using a combination of 454 shotgun and Illumina paired-end\nreads. The most highly-expressed genes predicted to encode\ndigestive-related enzymes were trypsins, carboxylesterases,\nβ-glucosidases, and cytochrome P450s. Furthermore, 180 unigenes\npredicted to encode glycoside hydrolases (GHs) were identified and\nincluded several GH 5, 45, and 48 cellulases, GH 1 xylanases, and GH 1\nβ-glucosidases. In addition, transcripts predicted to encode enzymes\ninvolved in detoxification were detected, including a substantial number\nof unigenes classified as cytochrome P450s (CYP6B) and\ncarboxylesterases, which are hypothesized to play pivotal roles in\ndetoxifying host tree defensive chemicals and could make important\ncontributions to A. glabripennis expansive host range. While a large\ndiversity of insect-derived transcripts predicted to encode digestive\nand detoxification enzymes were detected, few transcripts predicted to\nencode enzymes required for lignin degradation or synthesis of essential\nnutrients were identified, suggesting that collaboration with microbial\nenzymes may be required for survival in woody tissue. A. glabripennis\nproduces a number of enzymes with putative roles in cell wall digestion,\ndetoxification, and nutrient extraction, which likely contribute to its\nability to thrive in a broad range of host trees. This system is quite\ndifferent from the previously characterized termite fermentation system\nand provides new opportunities to discover enzymes that could be\nexploited for cellulosic ethanol biofuel production or the development\nof novel methods to control wood-boring pests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Midgut Transcriptome Profiling of Anoplophora\nglabripennis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67546.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Midgut Transcriptome Profiling of Anoplophora\nglabripennis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67547.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Midgut Transcriptome Profiling of Anoplophora\nglabripennis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67563.phy"}]}
