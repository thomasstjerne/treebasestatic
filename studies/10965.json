There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and\narchaeal genomes available, most of which were chosen for sequencing on\nthe basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by\nthe currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased\nphylogenetic distribution. To explore the value added by choosing\nmicrobial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary\nrelationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56\nculturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize\nphylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced\nbenefits (compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected\nfrom the existing database) in diverse areas including the\nreconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein\nfamilies and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for\nknown genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need\nfor systematic ‘phylogenomic’ efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven\n‘Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea’ in order to derive\nmaximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from\ngenome sequences to come.","trees":[{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"720","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bacteria and Archaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25470.phy"}]}
