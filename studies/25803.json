We were requested to identify\nan unknown pathogen of H. pluvialis from an algal growing facility in\nthe southwestern United States. To identify this zoosporic fungus and\ndetermine its phylogenetic placement among other chytrids, we isolated\nit into pure culture, photographed its morphology and zoospore\nultrastructure, and sequenced and analyzed portions of nuc rDNA 18S and\n28S genes. The organism belongs in the Chytridiomycota but a comparison\nof rDNA with available representatives of the phylum did not\nconvincingly place it in any described order. The unique zoospore\nultrastructure supports its indeterminate ordinal position, and the\nmorphology, as determined by light microscopy, did not match any\ndescribed species. Consequently, we have named this chytrid as the new\ngenus and species Quaeritorhiza haematococci in the family\nQuaeritorhizaceae but otherwise incertae sedis in the Chytridiomycetes.\nThis new taxon is important because it increases the known diversity of\nChytridiomycota, and the organism has the ability to disrupt\nagricultural production of an algal monoculture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytridiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121914.phy"}]}
