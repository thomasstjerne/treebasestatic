It is currently in\ndecline across its native habitat due, perhaps driven partially by\nclimate change but also by the presence of a new canker diseases caused\nby Quambalaria coyrecup. Few fungal leaf pathogens have been described\nfrom C. calophylla. The following paper describes two new species of\nTeratosphaeria from C. calophylla, Teratosphaeria calophylla sp. nov and\nT. rubidae sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9548","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9548.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9549","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9549.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9550","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9550.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9551","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9551.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9552","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9552.phy"}]}
