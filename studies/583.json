The cladogram confirms the\nmonophyly of Neocribellatae, Araneoclada, Entelegynae, and Orbiculariae.\nLycosoidea, Amaurobiidae and some included subfamilies, Dictynoidea, and\nAmaurobioidea (sensu Forster & Wilton 1973) are polyphyletic.\nPhyxelidinae Lehtinen is raised to family level (Phyxelididae, NEW\nRANK). The family Zorocratidae Dahl 1913 is revalidated. A group\nincluding all entelegynes other than Eresoidea is weakly supported as\nthe sister group of Orbiculariae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entelegyne","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3527.phy"}]}
