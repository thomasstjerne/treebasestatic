The new species resembles superficially the\nIndian I. tricolor Anandale, 1909 in having both a pale lateral stripe\nand an adjacent dark ventrolateral stripe contrasting with a paler\nventer. It differs from I. tricolor in having many more annuli, and in\nmany details of cranial osteology, and molecular data indicate that it\nis more closely related to other Southeast Asian Ichthyophis than to\nthose of South Asia. The caecilian fauna of Myanmar is exceptionally\npoorly known but is likely to include chikilids as well as multiple\nspecies of Ichthyophis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ichthyophis 12S+16S+CytB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_70386.phy"}]}
