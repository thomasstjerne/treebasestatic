Substantiating this, we definitively report that the asci of\nKarstenella are operculate. Karstenella vernalis has been reported only\nfrom the type locality in Finland; we expand its known distribution to\nNorth America (New Mexico). The inconspicuous ascomata of Karstenella\nconsist of very thin, resupinate apothecia borne on a subiculum.\nHypotheses of a close relationship with Pyronema (Pyronemataceae) or\nother highly reduced apothecial forms are rejected. Combined analyses\nshow that Karstenella constitutes an independent lineage within a highly\nsupported group of the lineages B (Morchellaceae \u001aDiscinaceae and\nHelvellaceae \u001aTuberaceae) and C (Ascodesmidaceae, Pyronemataceae,\nSarcoscyphaceae and Sarcosomataceae), Caloscyphaceae and Rhizinaceae.\nThis corroborates recognition of a monotypic genus and family of\nKarstenella. A possible sister group relationship with Caloscyphaceae\nand/or Helvellaceae\u001aTuberaceae is suggested. The ascospores of\nKarstenella are shown to be bi- to multinucleate using DAPI staining.\nExcipulum structure and/or spore cytology support a shared origin with\nCaloscyphaceae and/or the Helvellaceae\u001aTuberaceae sub-lineage.\nKarstenella possesses the most reduced form of ascomata found so far\noutside lineages A (e.g. Ascobolaceae) and C (e.g. Ascodesmidaceae and\nPyronemataceae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5432.phy"}]}
