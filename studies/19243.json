A total of 138 isolates were sampled and identifications were\nmade using a combination of morphology together with a phylogenetic\nanalysis based on partial translation elongation factor 1-α sequence\n(EF-1α), internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and β-tubulin sequence data.\nTen taxa were identified, namely, Lasiodiplodia brasiliense, L.\neuphorbicola, L. gonubiensis, L. iraniensis, L. jatrophicola, L.\ngravistriata sp. nov., L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae, Neofusicoccum\nbatangarum and Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum. Only L. theobromae has\npreviously been reported in cashews, while all the other species are\nreported for the first time in association with this host in Brazil and\nworldwide. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most prevalent species. All\nspecies of Botryosphaeriaceae were pathogenic on detached green shoots\nof cashew. There were significant differences in virulence among the\nspecies, with Neofusicoccum batangarum, L. iraniensis, L. jatrophicola\nand L. gravistriata being the most virulent species, while L.\neuphorbicola, L. pseudotheobromae were the least virulent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 21","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95690","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 22","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95691","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95691.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 23","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95692.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 24","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95693","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95693.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 25","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95694","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 26","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95695","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 27","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95696","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 28","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95697","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95697.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95673","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95673.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95674","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95675","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95676","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95676.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95677","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95677.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95678","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95679","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95679.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 11","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95680","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 12","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95681","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 13","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95682","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 14","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95683","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 15","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 16","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95685","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95686","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 18","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95687","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 19","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95688","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 20","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95689","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95670.phy"}]}
