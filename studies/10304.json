We examined type materials\nand fresh Taiwanese collections, and found distinct morphological\ncharacters of the perithecia, ascospores, cultures, etc. Sequence\nanalysis of the large subunit ribosomal DNA supports this disposition.\nRelationships between phylogeny and habitat association within\nConiochaeta are discussed. The detailed descriptions of and a key to C.\nleucoplaca and C. velutina are provided. These are new records for\nTaiwan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6722.phy"}]}
