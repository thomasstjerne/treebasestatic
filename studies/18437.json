However little is known about its evolutionary history and\nits phylogenetic relationship with other chlamydomonadalean algae is\nequivocal. Here, we attempt to clarify the phylogenetic position of UWO\n241, specifically with respect to Chlamydomonas raudensis SAG 49.72.\nContrary to a previous report, we show that UWO 241 is a distinct\nspecies from SAG 49.72. Our phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and plastid\nDNA sequences reveal that UWO 241 represents a unique lineage within the\nMoewusinia clade (sensu Nakada) of the Chlamydomonadales (Chlorophyceae,\nChlorophyta), closely affiliated to the marine species Chlamydomonas\nparkeae SAG 24.89.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyceae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92093.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"147","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyceae 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92094.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorophyceae rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92092.phy"}]}
