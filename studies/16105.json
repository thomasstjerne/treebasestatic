Maton (Zingiberaceae). A fungus was isolated\nfrom cadavers of cardamom thrips collected during a survey in cardamom\nplantations of Wayanad District, Kerala, India and identified as\nLecanicillium psalliotae (Treschew) Zare & W. Gams (Ascomycota:\nHypocreales) based on morphological characters and molecular studies.\nBio-assay studies with purified conidial suspension further confirmed\nthe infectivity of the fungus to thrips. At the highest dose tested (1 ×\n107 conidia/ml), mortality up to 62.9% was recorded in the test\npopulation, 10 days post inoculation. The fungal pathogenesis on adult\nthrips was documented by scanning electron microscopic studies. This is\nthe first record of L. psalliotae in India and also a first report of a\nfungus infecting cardamom thrips. The isolation of an entomopathogenic\nfungus could provide a platform for developing IPM programmes against\nthis pest in the field.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanicillium Neighbor-joining tree based on analysis\nof partial ITS rDNA gene sequences of L. psalliotae and other\nLecanicillium spp.","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_76298.phy"}]}
