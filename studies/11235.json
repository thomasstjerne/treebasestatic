Acoels have long been used\nas models in evolutionary scenarios, and generalized conclusions about\nacoel and bilaterian ancestral features are frequently drawn from\nstudies of single acoel species. There is no extensive phylogenetic\nstudy of Acoela and the taxonomy of the 380 species is chaotic. Here we\nuse two nuclear ribosomal genes and one mitochondrial gene in\ncombination with 37 morphological characters in an analysis of 126 acoel\nterminals (about one third of the described species) to estimate the\nphylogeny and character evolution of Acoela. We present an estimate of\nposterior probabilities for ancestral character states at 31 control\nnodes in the phylogeny. The overall reconstruction signal based on the\nshape of the posterior distribution of character states was computed for\nall morphological characters and control nodes to assess how well these\nwere reconstructed. The body-wall musculature appears more clearly\nreconstructed than the reproductive organs. Posterior similarity to the\nroot was calculated by averaging the divergence between the posterior\ndistributions at the nodes and the root over all morphological\ncharacters. Diopisthoporidae is the sister group to all other acoels and\nhas the highest posterior similarity to the root. Convolutidae,\nincluding several “model” acoels, is most divergent. Finally, we present\na phylogenetic classification of Acoela down to the family level where\nsix previous family level taxa are synonymized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural filtered MrBayes 4x8chains\n10Mgen Filtered","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27642.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural filtered RAxML 500reps\nMajrule Filtered","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27643.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural unfiltered MrBayes 4x8chains\n10Mgen","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27644.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural unfiltered RAxML 500reps\nMajrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27645.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural unfiltered Additional\noutgroups RAxML 500reps","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27641.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI structural filtered RAxML 500reps Majrule\nFiltered","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27649.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI structural unfiltered MrBayes 4x8chains\n10Mgen","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27650.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI structural unfiltered RAxML 500reps\nMajrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27651.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI non structural unfiltered TNT 500reps\nMajrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27646.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S 28S COI structural filtered MrBayes 4x8chains\n10Mgen.tre","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27648.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology 18S 28S COI non structural unfiltered\nMrBayes 2x8chains 10Mgen","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acoela","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27647.phy"}]}
