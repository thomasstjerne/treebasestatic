Hence it is important to identify the\nfungi associated with the flowering stage and their potential for\ninfecting berries. In the present study, endophytic fungi were isolated\nfrom the calyptra of the grape flower. In total 97 isolates were\nobtained from four different grape cultivars. We identified that those\nisolates were belonging to four genera namely Alternaria, Cladosporium,\nDiaporthe and Epicoccum. The most abundant genus was Alternaria with 88\nAlternaria alternata isolates. Four Cladosporium species were identified\nincluding two new host records (Cladosporium ramotenellum and\nCladosporium anthropophilum) and one new species (Cladosporium\nendophytica). In addition to that Diaporthe eres and a novel Epicoccum\nspecies (Epicoccum endophytica) were identified. This study provides\nbasic biological evidence that some of the fruit disease pathogens can\nexist as endophytes from the flowering stage. These results will be an\naddition to the current knowledge of grape pathogens and thus to develop\nsustainable management strategies","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121399.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121400.phy"}]}
