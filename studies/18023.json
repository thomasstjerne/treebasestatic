Thus,\nit does not belong to the Athyriaceae where previously classified. A new\nfamily, Desmophlebiaceae, and a new genus, Desmophlebium, are described\nto accommodate this relationship. Morphologically, Desmophlebium is\ndistinguished from Diplazium by the combination of thick 1-pinnate\nlaminae, entire pinnae, decurrent distal pinnae, conform lamina apices\n(i.e., the terminal segment is similar to the lateral pinnae), and the\npresence of a submarginal connecting vein. On the basis of morphology,\nwe also assign Diplazium longisorum to the new family and genus.\nAccordingly, the new combinations Desmophlebium lechleri and D.\nlongisorum are provided. A lectotype is designated for Diplazium\nparallelogrammum, a synonym of Desmophlebium lechleri. Desmophlebium\ngrows in humid forests from 125 to 1900 m. Desmophlebium lechleri occurs\nfrom Panama to north-central and northeastern Brazil, and D. longisorum\noccurs in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Desmophlebiaceae and Desmophlebium Comb5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89357.phy"}]}
