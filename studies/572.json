The overall rate of nucleotide substitution (both silent and\nreplacement changes) is approximately three times higher in lice, and\nthe rate of synonymous substitution (based on analysis of fourfold\ndegenerate sites) is approximately an order of magnitude greater in\nlice. The difference in synonymous substitution rate between lice and\ngophers correlates with a difference of similar magnitude in generation\ntimes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gopher lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3503.phy"}]}
