They have been regarded as\nclosely related genera within the family Lophiostomataceae, but their\nmorphological circumscriptions were uncertain. To clarify generic\ndefinition of Lophiostoma and Lophiotrema, we conducted a phylogenetic\nanalysis of 29 isolates of these genera was carried out based on the SSU\nand LSU nrDNA sequences, and also re-evaluated several key characters\npreviously used for their generic characterization. Our result clearly\nconfirmed that Lophiostoma and Lophiotrema are distinct genera belonging\nto different families and ascus shape including length of ascus stipe is\na reliable taxonomic indicator to discriminate between the genera. In\nLophiostoma species, asci are clavate with a relatively long stipe\n(mostly (10) 1530 µm long), whereas in Lophiotrema those are cylindrical\nwith a short stipe (up to 15 µm long). A new family, Lophiotremataceae,\nis proposed to accommodate species in the Lophiotrema clade which was\ndistantly placed from the Lophiostomataceae within the Pleosporales.\nLophiostoma quadrisporum, collected from twigs of Liriodendron\ntulipifera, is described as a new species with distinctive 4-spored\nasci. Lophiotrema vitigenum, which has clavate asci with a long stipe,\nis transferred to Lophiostoma.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP
