The phylogenetic position of two types of conidia\nproduced by G. verticiclada was examined. The first conidia type was\nidentified like G. verticiclada and the second like synanamorph\nIdriella. Both types were isolated, cultivated, photographed and\ndeposited in the MycothÃ¨que de l’UniversitÃ© Catholique de Louvain.\nEvidence total matrix was made based in molecular and morphological\ndata. For molecular data, multiple gene sequences: ITS, partial sequence\nof 28S large subunit and partial sequence of translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha were obtained for seven different individuals of G.\nverticiclada, six species of the genus Idriella and six of the genus\nGyrothrix. Twenty-eight morphological characters were selected for the\nmorphological matrix. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with maximum\nparsimony as optimality criteria. Analyses indicate that the two types\nof conidia formed a monophyletic group with others individuals of G.\nverticiclada. Relationship with teleomorph state of G. verticiclada was\nrecovered in Xylariales into the families Hyponectriaceae and\nXylariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 12","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70775","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70775.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 13","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70776","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70776.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 14","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70777","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70777.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 15","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70778.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 16","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70779.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70780","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70780.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 18","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70781","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70781.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 19","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70782","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70782.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 20","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70783.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 21","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70784.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 22","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70785.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 23","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70786.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 24","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70787.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70764","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70764.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70765","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70765.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70766","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70766.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70767","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70767.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70768","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70768.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70769","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70769.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70788.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70770","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70770.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70771.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70772","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70773","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70773.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 11","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70774","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70774.phy"}]}
