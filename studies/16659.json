Based on phylogenetic and\nmorphological studies, the genus is currently divided into 26 sections.\nAlternaria sect. Alternaria contains most of the small-spored Alternaria\nspecies with concatenated conidia, including important plant, human and\npostharvest pathogens. Species within sect. Alternaria have been mostly\ndescribed based on morphology and / or host-specificity, yet molecular\nvariation between them is minimal. To investigate whether the described\nmorphospecies within sect. Alternaria are supported by molecular data,\nwhole-genome sequencing of nine Alternaria morphospecies supplemented\nwith transcriptome sequencing of 12 Alternaria morphospecies as well as\nmulti-gene sequencing of 168 Alternaria isolates was performed. The\nassembled genomes ranged in size from 33.335.2 Mb within sect.\nAlternaria and from 32.039.1 Mb for all Alternaria genomes. The number\nof repetitive sequences differed significantly between the different\nAlternaria genomes; ranging from 1.416.5 %. The repeat content within\nsect. Alternaria was relatively low with only 1.42.7 % of repeats.\nWhole-genome alignments revealed 96.798.2 % genome identity between\nsect. Alternaria isolates, compared to 85.189.3 % genome identity for\nisolates from other sections to the A. alternata reference genome.\nSimilarly, 1.42.8 % and 0.81.8 % single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\nwere observed in genomic and transcriptomic sequences, respectively,\nbetween isolates from sect. Alternaria, while the percentage of SNPs\nfound in isolates from different sections compared to the A. alternata\nreference genome was considerably higher; 8.010.3 % and 6.18.5 %. The\ntopology of a phylogenetic tree based on the whole-genome and\ntranscriptome reads was congruent with multi-gene phylogenies based on\ncommonly used gene regions. Based on the genome and transcriptome data,\na set of core proteins was extracted, and primers were designed on two\ngene regions with a relatively low degree of conservation within sect.\nAlternaria (96.8 and 97.3 % conservation). Their potential\ndiscriminatory power within sect. Alternaria was tested next to nine\ncommonly used gene regions in sect. Alternaria, namely the SSU, LSU,\nITS, gapdh, rpb2, tef1, Alt a 1, endoPG and OPA10-2 gene regions. The\nphylogenies from the two gene regions with a relatively low\nconservation, KOG1058 and KOG1077, could not distinguish the described\nmorphospecies within sect. Alternaria more effectively than the\nphylogenies based on the commonly used gene regions for Alternaria.\nBased on genome and transcriptome comparisons and molecular phylogenies,\nAlternaria sect. Alternaria consists of only 11 phylogenetic species and\none species complex. Thirty-five morphospecies, which cannot be\ndistinguished based on the multi-gene phylogeny, are synonymised under\nA. alternata. By providing guidelines for the naming and identification\nof phylogenetic species in Alternaria sect. Alternaria, this manuscript\nprovides a clear and stable species classification in this section.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79575","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79575.phy"},{"tree_label":"SSU MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79579","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79579.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2 MrBayes","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79578","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79578.phy"},{"tree_label":"endoPGupdated","ntax":"167","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85719","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85719.phy"},{"tree_label":"OPA10 2updated","ntax":"164","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85720","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85720.phy"},{"tree_label":"KOG1058 MrBayes","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria section Alternaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79581.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79576","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79576.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF1 MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79580","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Alta1updated","ntax":"165","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85718","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85718.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated gene tree MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79583","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79583.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenated gene tree RAxML","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79584","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79584.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDH MrBayes","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria section Alternaria","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79574.phy"},{"tree_label":"KOG1077 MrBayes","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr79582","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79582.phy"}]}
