However, the identity of the causal agents has not\nyet been investigated. Between August 2008 and June 2010, wood samples\nfrom branches of almond trees showing internal necroses and brown to\nblack vascular streaking were collected in the Llevant region on the\nisland of Mallorca. Several fungal species were subsequently isolated\nfrom the margin between healthy and symptomatic tissue. Five species of\nBotryosphaeriaceae (namely Botryosphaeria dothidea, Diplodia olivarum,\nD. seriata, Neofusicoccum australe and N. parvum), Eutypa lata,\nPhaeoacremonium iranianum and Phomopsis amygdali were identified based\non morphology, culture characteristics and DNA sequence comparisons.\nNeofusicoccum parvum was the dominant species, followed by E. lata, D.\nolivarum and N. australe. First reports from almond include D. olivarum\nand Pm. iranianum. Two species are newly described, namely Collophora\nhispanica sp. nov. and Phaeoacremonium amygdalinum sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.3","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52965.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.2","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"CollophoraMP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52961.phy"}]}
