(Malvaceae) was\nundertaken using DNA sequence data. Nuclear (internal transcribed\nspacers 1 and 2) and plastid (ndhF, rpl16 intron, and 3Â’ matK-trnK\nintron) sequence data were used to reconstruct independent phylogenies\nfor related genera of tribe Malveae, to which Urocarpidium belongs. The\nnuclear and plastid phylogenies indicate that Urocarpidium albiflorum is\nnot synonymous with Tarasa operculata as previously suggested,\nconsistent with earlier phylogenetic studies. Instead, this species is\nmore closely related to Fuertesimalva and Palaua, although its position\nrelative to these two genera differs in the nuclear and plastid trees.\nGiven the unresolved phylogenetic position and unique suite of\nmorphological characters, Urocarpidium is maintained as a monotypic\ngenus. Full synonymy for Urocarpidium albiflorum is also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocarpidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46006.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urocarpidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46004.phy"}]}
