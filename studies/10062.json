A recent molecular\nphylogenetic study, based on 51 species (including P. fragrans)\nelucidated the evolutionary relationships within the genus. The present\nstudy includes P. gardneri and P. glossopetala in the phylogenetic\nanalyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods, based\non five chloroplast regions (psbA-trnH spacer, trnL-F, matK, rbcL, and\natpB-rbcL spacer). The new nomenclatural combination Pseuduvaria\nphuyensis is also validated in accordance with the phylogenetic analyses\nwhich show that Craibella phuyensis and Pseuduvaria form a\nwell-supported monophyletic clade. The new species and new nomenclature\ncombination bring the total number of species in Pseuduvaria to 56. The\ntaxonomic status of the enigmatic monotypic genus Oreomitra from New\nGuinea is furthermore evaluated, and the name shown to be synonymous\nwith Pseuduvaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseuduvaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6396.phy"}]}
