The individual topologies\nwere largely congruent (i.e. lacking ìhardî incongruence), with the\nexception of the placement of C. caliopsidea by analyses of\nmorphological data. Because the two molecular data sets are generally in\nagreement regarding the placement of this taxon, the morphological data\nfor C. caliopsidea were pruned; PHT tests of this pruned data set\nindicated no significant heterogeneity among the data partitions.\nTherefore the data were combined and reanalyzed. The resulting topology\nsupports the monophyly of sections Tuckermannia and Leptosyne; however,\nsection Pugiopappus is not monophyletic. This latter section as\ntraditionally defined includes species that display an annual habit and\ndimorphic cypselae. Examining the evolution of these two features in\nlight of the phylogeny indicates that each has arisen twice. The\nevolution of two other features, pubescent fruits and the presence of\npappus scales, is more complex than previously suggested. Alternative\nreconstructions of the evolution of these features are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1291.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A.2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1282.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A.1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1283.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B.2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B.1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B.3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C.3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1287.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C.2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1288.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C.1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1289.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C.4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coreopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1290.phy"}]}
