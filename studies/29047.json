In mycorrhizal association\nwith orchids, Ceratobasidium can establish a highly specific\ninteraction. Gomesa recurva is an epiphytic orchid occurring in the\nBrazilian Atlantic Forest. In the present study mycorrhizal fungi were\nisolated from roots of G. recurva and its phylogenetic positions was\ninvestigated. A total of nine isolates were obtained directly from\npelotons and submitted to phylogenetic analysis based on alignments of\nsequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear\nribosomal DNA. Phylogenetic analyzes, along with morphological data,\nrevealed that isolates are distinct from all known Ceratobasidium\nspecies and a new species, namely Ceratobasidium gomesae sp. nov., is\nproposed. Given the dependence on mycorrhizae for germination and\nprotocorm development, knowledge about orchids symbionts is an important\nfactor in managing the conservation of these plants, and future studies\nmay investigate the ability of C. gomesae to promote seed\ngermination.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134662.phy"}]}
