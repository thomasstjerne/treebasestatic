Microseris\npygmaea occurs at lower elevations in Chile and has originated after\nlong-distance dispersal from a Californian progenitor. Differences in\nflowering traits and habitat preferences of the new population raised\nthe question of its precise phylogenetic affiliation. The analysis of\nthe nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of all\nMicroseris species revealed the Peruvian plants as part of the Chilean\nM. pygmaea clade. Molecular, ecological, and physiological data resulted\nin an interpretation of the Peruvian population as derived from Chilean\nprogenitors instead of being remnants of stepping-stone dispersal from\nNorth America through the Andes to Chile. Differences in ITS sequences\nfound in this study compared to earlier ones were explained by the\noccurrence of two different rDNA clusters in the genome of Microseris,\nwhich were preferentially amplified by differences in the PCR\nprotocols.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"2n-Microseris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"2n+4n-Microseris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4389.phy"}]}
