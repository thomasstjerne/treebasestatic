Ten sugar combinations\nbased on three simple sugars were generated with two different\nconcentrations, namely 3.3% and 16.7%, which represented low and high\nsugar levels, respectively, adjusted to pH 5 and 8. Growth of the\nGanoderma isolates (two G. boninense from oil palm, one Ganoderma\nspecies from coconut palm, G. lingzhi, and G. australe from tower tree)\nwas faster at pH 8. Ganoderma lingzhi proliferated at the slowest rate\ncompared to all other tested Ganoderma species in all the media studied.\nGanoderma boninense isolates from oil palm grew at the fastest rate.\nDifferences in sugar preference based on Ganoderma mycelial growth rate\ncould be an additional taxonomic parameter for separating G. boninense\nfrom other Ganoderma species. Overall, it was illustrated that mixture\ndesign of media can be used to evaluate fungal growth on media with\nvarious combinations of sugar or other nutrient/chemical component.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87982","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87982.phy"}]}
