The genus was recognized as polyphyletic by molecular analyses\nand divided into three genera: Megasporia, Megasporoporia sensu stricto\nand Megasporoporiella. In the present study, phylogenies based on the\ncombined 2-gene (ITS + nLSU) and 4-gene (ITS + nLSU + mtSSU + TEF)\nsequences datasets of Megasporoporia sensu lato are analysed, and 21\nlineages nested in three clades (the Megasporia clade, the\nMegasporoporia sensu stricto clade and the Megasporoporiella clade) are\nformed. Based on morphological examination, four new species, Megasporia\nbambusae, Megasporia fusiformis, Megasporoporia inflata and\nMegasporoporiella australiae, are described based on materials from\nAustralia, China and Malaysia, and a new combination, Megasporoporiella\nhubeiensis comb. nov., is proposed. Megasporoporiella pseudocavernulosa\nis selected as the type species of Megasporoporiella because the\nprevious type species Megasporoporiella cavernulosa was misidentified.\nPolyporus megasporoporus is the revised name for Megasporoporiella\nlacerata. In addition, a comparison of main characteristics and an\nidentification key of Megasporoporia sensu lato are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
