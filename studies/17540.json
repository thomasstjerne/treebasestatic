The phylogenetic position of\nthe species based on nrITS data is analyzed and discussed. L.\nsquamulodiffracta belongs in section Lepiota, and it is characterized by\nthe velar patches on pileus split up into numerous minute squamules,\nstriate-sulcate pileus up to the center, and penguin-shaped spores. L.\nsosuensis has overall white basidiocarps, dextrinoid and metachromatic\nspores, trichodermial pileus covering, and rare clamp-connections. L.\nsubgranulosa stands out morphologically by the spurred spores with one\nor several protuberances that give the spores an irregular outline.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepiota ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100534.phy"}]}
