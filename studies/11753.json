Here we use\nfour commonly employed loci to estimate if their use increases\nphylogenetic resolution and support. The present study largely confirms\nthe topologies of previous studies, but with increased support.\nApproximately half of the genera in the cetrarioid core were not\nmonophyletic. Melanelia sorediella was clustered within Cetrariella, and\nthe combination Cetrariella sorediella (Lettau) V. J. Rico & A.\nThell comb. nov. is made. Additionally, the genus Flavocetrariella was\nsupported as part of Nephromopsis and is considered to be a synonym of\nthe latter. Finally, a comparison of genetic distances shows that the\nmaximum intrageneric genetic distance encompassed by many cetrarioid\ngenera is lower than that of many other genera in Parmeliaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BayesianTree MrBayes MajRuleCon","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetrarioid Core Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47686.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLTree RAxML GTRGAMMA","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetrarioid Core Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47685.phy"}]}
