Moreover, Thomandersia is shown to be a\nmorphologically distinct clade, lying outside all currently\ncircumscribed families of Lamiales. We therefore propose resurrection of\nfamily Thomandersiaceae. Phylogenetic analyses provide moderate support\nfor a sister group relationship between Thomandersiaceae and\nSchlegeliaceae. In addition, the morphological variation within and\nbetween species is described and six species are recognised. A new\ntaxonomic treatment of these six species, including an improved key,\ndescriptions, illustrations and distribution maps, is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"strict","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4681.phy"}]}
