The data support the monophyly of\nArctostaphylos, Arctous, and Comarostaphylis, but suggest that Arbutus\nis not monophyletic, with Mediterranean Basin species more closely\nrelated to the clade containing Arctostaphylos, Arctous,\nComarostaphylis, Ornithostaphylos and Xylococcus than to the western\nNorth American species of Arbutus. Calibration of branch lengths with\nthe fossil record suggests that a vicariance event occurred among\nmembers of the Arbutoideae between western North America and the\nMediterranean Basin at the Paleogene/Neogene boundary, consistent with\nthe Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5567.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5566.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5569.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arbutoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5570.phy"}]}
