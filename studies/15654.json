It is distinct from other Scytalidium species in having\nsmaller asci and ascospores (teleomorphic stage), longer arthroconidia\n(anamorphic stage), hyaline to yellowish chlamydospores, and producing a\nfluorescent pigment. The phylogenetic position of S. parasiticum was\ndetermined by sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacers and\nthe small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene regions. A key to identify\nScytalidium species with teleomorphic stage is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scytalidium SSU NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87983.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xylogone","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_73447.phy"}]}
