Furthermore, in the last decade,\nQatar has been witnessing an industrial boom as well as extensive\ninfrastructure construction activities. Marine micro-organisms,\nincluding fungi, remain largely unexplored in the Arabian Gulf. During a\n3 year study, we investigated the diversity of marine fungi in coastal\nwaters around Qatar. As a result, two new Toxicocladosporium species\nwere isolated from the Qatari marine environment. Molecular and\nphylogenetic analyses of rRNA gene sequences of five loci, namely the\ninternal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 regions and the D1/D2 domains of the\nlarge subunit rRNA, actin, RNA polymerase second largest subunit and\nbeta-tubulin genes, were used to confirm the identity of the novel\nspecies for which we propose the names Toxicocladosporium aquimarinum\nsp. nov. and Toxicocladosporium qatarense sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117231","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117231.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117230.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117232","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117232.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117227.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117229.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117228.phy"}]}
