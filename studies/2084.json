Ergot fungi found on\nAgrostis gigantea, Alopecurus aequalis var. amurensis and Polypogon\nfugax in Ishikawa prefecture, were morphologically identified as C.\npurpurea var. alopecuri. Phylogenetic analysis of Claviceps spp. using\nITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region revealed that the C. purpurea was divided\ninto at least two groups. These phylogenetic groups were considered to\nbe populations which have parasitic preference. Consequently, the\nphylogenetic group including C. purpurea var. alopecuri was regarded as\na population that can parasitize to barley and wheat.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr3043","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3043.phy"}]}
