The two\ndata sets were analyzed independently and examined for congruent\npatterns with each other and against biogeographic-geologic data.\nPatterns indicated by morphological, karyological, and\nbiogeographic-geologic data suggest two sister groups: (1)\nKlauberina-Xantusia; and (2) Cricosaura-Lepidophyma. Our phylogeny\ndiffers from the accepted view of xantusiid relationships in suggesting\nthat Lepidophyma should be transferred from the subfamily Xantusiinae\n(currently consisting of Klauberina, Lepidophyma, and Xantusia) to the\nCricosaurinae. We propose a vicariance model for the distribution of the\nXantusia-Klauberina clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xantusiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1459.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xantusiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1460.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xantusiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1461.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Xantusiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1462.phy"}]}
