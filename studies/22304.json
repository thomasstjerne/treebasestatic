The species was previously reported in Japan and China only, and\nit was assumed that its geographical range is limited to the northwest\nPacific. Probably Possibly the species was overlooked in Atlantic waters\nbecause of its morphological similarity with the Atlantic species\nH.aliclystus octoradiatus Clark, 1863. However, the low intra-specific\nvariation in mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)\ndoes not indicate a geographic separation of Atlantic and Pacific\nspecimens and may indicate a non-native introduction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111598","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_111598.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111595.phy"}]}
