Fungi\nin Sclerocystis sensu lato were distinguished by formation of complex\nsporocarps. Most species were transferred to Glomus, but both their\ntaxonomic and phylogenetic relations remain the subject of controversy.\nPhylogenetic analysis of the 18S ribosomal subunit of G. sinuosum (= S.\nsinuosa) and S. coremioides shows that both species are each otherâ€™s\nclosest relatives and fall within a monophyletic clade comprising the\nwell-characterized species, G. mosseae, G. intraradices and G.\nvesiculiferum, to the exclusion of several other Glomus species. This\nplacement indicates that formation of complex sporocarps is an advanced\ncharacter of some Glomus species, but the sporocarpic trait is not\nsufficiently unique to group these species into a separate genus\nSclerocystis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3536.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3537.phy"}]}
