Previous taxonomic treatments remark that the species is\nmorphologically variable and difficult to identify, but to date no study\nhas analyzed molecular data to investigate possible cryptic or seemingly\ncryptic (pseudo-cryptic) diversity in this species. We sequenced 216\nspecimens matching or closely resembling the currently accepted\ndescription of H. eruditus for a mitochondrial (COI) and a nuclear\nmarker (28S), and scored six morphological characters. We also compared\nthe morphology of H. eruditus syntypes and type material of 26\nsynonymized species with the sequenced material. The sequenced material\ngrouped in 21 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) supported by both\nmolecular and morphological data, 17 of which were part of an apparent\nH. eruditus species complex. Another 9 cryptic OTUs, distinguishable\nonly by molecular data, were also included in the complex. Only one of\nthe OTUs revealed a morphological match with the H. eruditus syntypes.\nThe 26 synonymized species were split into 14 tentative morphs, 11 of\nwhich did not match the H. eruditus syntypes. We argue that many of our\nsequenced OTUs deserve species status, and that many species synonymized\nunder H. eruditus should be resurrected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
