Only 4 species were well documented in Neodon for a long\nperiod of time until last years when a systematic work described and\nadded three new species, adjusted three species used to belong to\nLasiopodomys, Phaiomys, Microtus to Neodon and removed one species\n(Neodon juldaschi) to genus Blanfordimys, leading to a total of eight\nspecies recorded in Neodon. To gain a better insight into the phylogeny\nand ecology of Neodon, we have systematically sampled Neodon species\nalong the whole Hengduan and Himalayan Mountains in the last 20 years.\nIn addition to morphological identification, we generated 1x - 15x whole\ngenome sequencing (WGS) data and achieved the mitochondrial genomes and\nan average of 5,382 nuclear genes for each morpho-species. Both\nmorphology and phylogeny results supported an extra six new species in\nNeodon (nominated Neodon shergylaensis sp. nov., N. namchabarwaensis sp.\nnov., N. liaoruii sp. nov., N. chayuensis sp. nov., N. bomiensis sp.\nnov., and N. bershulaensis sp. nov.). This is the first study that\nincluded Neodon samples covering its entire distribution area in China\nand this systematic sampling also revealed a long-time underestimation\nof NeodonÂ’s diversity, and suggested its speciation events linked highly\nto founder event via dispersal (from Plateau to surrounding mountains).\nThe results also revealed that the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the center\nof origin of Neodon, and the impetus of speciation include climate\nchange, isolation of rivers and mountains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Neodon_nuclear_genes_tree_from_RAxML","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121080.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_nuclear_genes_tree_from_ASTRAL_add_length_by_ExaML","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121075.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_nuclear_genes_tree_from_ASTRAL","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_nuclear_genes_consensus_tree_from_Paup","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121077.phy"},{"tree_label":"nuclear w ratios tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121083","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_nuclear_genes_tree_from_Mrbayes","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_COXi_tree_from_RAxML","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121084.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_Mitochondrial_tree_from_Mrbayes","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121085.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon_CYTb_tree_from_RaxML","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121087.phy"},{"tree_label":"Final_Time_tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mitochondrial w ratios tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121090.phy"},{"tree_label":"nulcear dS tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121081.phy"},{"tree_label":"nuclear dN tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Neodon Mitochondrial tree from RAxML","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121086","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mitochondrial dS tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121088","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121088.phy"},{"tree_label":"Mitochondrial dN tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121089.phy"}]}
