Detailed physiological and phylogenetic analyses showed\nthat the strains belong to the genus Barnettozyma of the\nSaccharomycetales (Ascomycota, Saccharomycotina), but did not correspond\nto any of the hitherto recognised species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Barnettozyma 26S ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5990.phy"}]}
