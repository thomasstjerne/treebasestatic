Fifty-three members of both genera were\nanalysed together with three related outgroup genera. Neighbor-joining\nand Bayesian inferences of phylogeny indicate the monophyly of a\nbipartite genus Sporisorium and the monophyly of a core Ustilago clade.\nBoth methods confirm the recently published nomenclatural change of the\ncane smut Ustilago scitaminea to Sporisorium scitamineum and indicate a\nputative connection between Ustilago maydis and Sporisorium . Overall,\nthe three clades resolved in our analyses are only weakly supported by\nmorphological characters. Still, their preferences to parasitize certain\nsubfamilies of Poaceae could be used to corroborate our results: all\nmembers of both Sporisorium groups occur exclusively on the grass\nsubfamily Panicoideae. The core Ustilago group mainly infects the\nsubfamilies Pooideae or Chloridoideae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ustilago and Sporisorium species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ustilago and Sporisorium species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5858.phy"}]}
