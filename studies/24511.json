It has been argued that the\nassociation between fungi and sponges is not truly symbiotic, and fungal\npresence is incidental. Nevertheless, a vertically transmitted\nendosymbiotic yeast has been observed by transmission electron\nmicroscopy in sponges of the genus Chondrilla. Our work focused on\ndocumenting the presence of yeasts associated with marine sponges from\nPuerto Rico. Sponge samples were taken from healthy mature colonies of\nIrcinia strobilina, Tedania ignis, and Chondrilla caribensis. A total of\n36 yeast morphotypes were isolated and analysed by sequencing the\nnuclear ribosomal ITS region. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was isolated\nfrom all samples, comprising the first report of this yeast as a common\ninhabitant in marine sponges. Other yeasts isolated include the\nhalophilic black yeast, Hortaea werneckii, and an unidentified species\nbelonging to the Sporidiobolales (Basidiomycota). The high frequency of\nisolation of S. cerevisiae from our sponge samples supports the\npossibility that Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an active member of the\nsponges microbial community.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Result","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118638","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118638.phy"}]}
