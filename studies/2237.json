In addition to widely\ndistributed species, understudied species (e.g., Calvatia cf.Â leiospora\nand Holocotylon brandegeeanum) are treated. Taxonomic descriptions and\nillustrations, which include microscopic characters, are given for each\nspecies, and a dichotomous key is presented to facilitate\nidentification. Basidiospore morphology was also examined\nultrastructurally using scanning electron microscopy, and phylogenetic\nanalyses were carried out on nrRNA gene sequences (ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8S)\nfrom 42 species within (or closely allied to) the Lycoperdaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycoperdaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5462.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ bootstrap","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycoperdaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5463.phy"}]}
