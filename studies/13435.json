Msh4 and Msh5 have been lost\nfrom the flies Drosophila and Glossina but we identified a complex of\nmini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins that functionally replace\nMsh4Msh5. REC, an ortholog of MCM8 that is divergent in flies, interacts\nwith MEI 217 and MEI-218, which arose from one a previously undescribed\nancestral metazoan-specific MCM protein. Meiotic crossovers are reduced\nin Drosophila rec, mei-217, and mei-218 mutants; however, removal of the\nBloom syndrome helicase ortholog restores crossovers. Thus, MCMs were\nco-opted into a novel complex to replace the meiotic pro-crossover\nfunction of Msh4Msh5 in flies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MCM5-MCM8 ML","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MCM5 + MCM8 metazoans ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_57563.phy"}]}
