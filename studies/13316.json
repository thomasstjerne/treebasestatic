Two new species are described, Evaniscus\nlansdownei Mullins n. sp. from Colombia and Brazil and E. rafaeli Kawada\nn. sp. from Brazil. Evaniscus sulcigenis Roman syn. n., is synonymized\nunder E. rufithorax Enderlein. An identification key to species of\nEvaniscus is provided. Thirty-five parsimony informative morphological\ncharacters are analyzed for six ingroup and four outgroup taxa. A\ntopology resulting in a monophyletic Evaniscus is presented with E.\ntibialis and E. rafaeli as sister to the remaining Evaniscus species.\nThe Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology and other relevant biomedical\nontologies are employed to create semantic phenotype statements in\nEntity-Quality (EQ) format for species descriptions. This approach is an\nearly effort to formalize species descriptions and to make descriptive\ndata available to other domains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"exhaustive","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evaniscus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57917.phy"},{"tree_label":"bootstrap","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evaniscus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57918.phy"},{"tree_label":"jackknife","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evaniscus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57919.phy"}]}
