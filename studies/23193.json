To clarify their phylogenetic\nrelationships, a dataset was generated containing sequences of nuclear\nDNA from the ribosomal largest subunit 28S (LSU) composed of holotype\nand other Raveneliaceae representatives, available in the GenBank, for\nanalysis of Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Morphologically,\nS itatiaiensis is characterized by the teliospore head without\nornamentation, echinulated urediniospores with 6-8 germ pores and\nuredinial and telial paraphyses chambered. Phylogenetically is closely\nrelated to species Ravenelia, genus of which Spumula differs by the\npresence of a single pedicel. This is the second species of Spumula to\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113312","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113312.phy"}]}
