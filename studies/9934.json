The known populations of this variety are\nall located in Clark County, Nevada, USA. We compared AFLP profiles and\nchloroplast DNA sequences of plants sampled from populations of E.\ncorymbosum var. nilesii with those of plants representing other E.\ncorymbosum varieties and related Eriogonum species from Colorado, Utah,\nnorthern Arizona, and northern New Mexico. We found evidence of genetic\ncohesion among the Clark County populations as well as their genetic\ndivergence from populations of other E. corymbosum varieties and\nspecies. The genetic component uncovered in this study supports the\nmorphological findings upon which the nomenclatural change was based,\nattesting to the taxonomic distinctness of this biological entity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eriogonum corymbosum var. nilesii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6575.phy"}]}
