Morosphaeria muthupetensis\nis characterized by large sub-globose to lenticular ascomata, long\ncylindrical to clavate, short pedicellate asci, small, fusiform to\nellipsoidal ascospores with acute ends when compared to other\nMorosphaeria species. Multigene phylogeny from a combined LSU, SSU, ITS\nand TEF-1Î± sequence data revealed that Morosphaeria muthupetensis is a\ndistinct taxon nested in between M. velatispora and M. ramunculicola and\nthese species constitute a strongly supported monophyletic clade sister\nto the genus Helicascus. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of M.\nmuthupetensis are presented and compared with other Morosphaeria\nspecies. Intergeneric relationships as well as the significance of the\nmucilaginous sheath are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111640.phy"}]}
