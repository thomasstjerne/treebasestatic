In macro- and micro-morphology, this species is\nsimilar to P. kuehneri but differs in basidiospore morphology: shape is\nmore rhomboid or mitriform and also rostrated at the base (around\napiculus). This distinct basidiospore shape differentiates this species\nfrom all other Parasola species. The results of phylogenetic analysis\nwith the ITS data also support this new taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95095.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neighbor joining tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_95094.phy"}]}
