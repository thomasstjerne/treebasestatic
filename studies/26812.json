In this study, we tested the\nhypothesis that the causal agent of black spot belongs to the same\nspecies pathogenic to brown eye spot. Nineteen strains obtained from\ndiseased coffee found in the five largest coffee-producing states of\nBrazil were characterized by a combination of molecular phylogenic\nmethods, using a multi-locus approach (internal transcribed spacer\nregions and intervening 5.8S nrRNAs, actin, calmodulin, histone H3, and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha), analyses of morphological\nmarkers and pathogenicity. Strains from brown eye spot and black spot\ndisease on coffee leaves formed a clade with C. coffeicola strain from\nJapan. All strains showed same morphological characteristics and caused\nbrown eye spot symptoms in greenhouse. These results confirm that the\nspecies associated with brown eye spot and black Spot disease on coffee\nleaves is C. coffeicola. Additionally, an epitype is proposed for C.\ncoffeicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"132","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora coffeicola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128401.phy"}]}
