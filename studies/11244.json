Observations on the disposition and the\nimmediate surroundings of immature spores within the spore capsule\nindicate that the Heydenia fruiting bodies are teleomorphs producing\nearly evanescent asci in stipitate cleistothecia. The once advocated\nidentity of Heydenia with Onygena is refuted on molecular grounds.\nOnygena arietina E.
