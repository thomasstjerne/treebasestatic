The Thysanophora-like isolates\nbelong in the genus Penicillium on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of\ntheir gene sequences. Because these isolates have unique phylogenetic\npositions within Penicillium and have unique phenotypes we describe them\nas the new species P. boreae, P. subarcticum and P. canariense spp. nov.\nIn addition, P. pullum sp. nov. is described for NRRL 721, which served\nas the typical isolate of P. fuscum in the monographic studies of Raper\n& Thom and Ramirez; however, the name P. fuscum has been applied and\nneotypified using a different specimen. NRRL 721 is markedly different\nphylogenetically from the neotype of P. fuscum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 33","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupenicillium stolkiae clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6509.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 32","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupenicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6166.phy"}]}
