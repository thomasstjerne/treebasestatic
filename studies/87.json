Comparative studies between Heterotoma and\nselected members of Lobelia utilizing macro- and micromorphology of\npollen and seed testa, anatomy, and field studies support a hypothesis\nof three independent derivations of nectar spurs in two sections of\nLobelia. The present treatment recognizes 12 species (14 taxa).\nHeterotoma lobelioides, including two varieties, is retained as a\nmonotypic genus. The remaining species are transferred to Lobelia sect.\nHemipogon. The revision includes keys, descriptions, distribution maps,\nand illustrations (or references to such) for each species. One new\nvariety (H. lobelioides var. glabra) is described, four new combinations\nare made (L. aurita, L. endlichii, L. flexuosa var. intermedia, and L.\ngoldmannii), and one new name is proposed (L. volcanica).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterotoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1557.phy"}]}
