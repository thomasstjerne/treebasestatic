Although isolated from\nsoils and plant debris, knowledge on the occurrence and distribution of\nthe FSSC in grassland soils of South Africa is extremely limited. To\nclose this gap, 62 soilborne fusaria isolated from five nature reserves\nin the Gauteng and Free State provinces were characterised using\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-a) nucleotide sequences.\nSequence based identification revealed that all isolates were members of\nthe FSSC. Molecular phylogenetic studies show the FSSC represent 60\nphylogenetically distinct species, further resolved into three clades\ndesignated Clades 1, 2, and 3. In the present study, phylogenetic\nanalysis based on resolved the South African isolates into three species\nwithin clade 3 of the FSSC, those being Fusarium solani sensu stricto\n(58.1%), F. falciforme (38.7%) and F. neocosmosporiellum (3.2%). This is\nthe first report of F. falciforme and F. solani sensu stricto isolated\nfrom native soils with low anthropogenic disturbance in South\nAfrica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126949","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126949.phy"}]}
