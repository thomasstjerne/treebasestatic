Morphologically this new genus combines characteristic\nfeatures of Bartsia and of Odontites. Its autonomous systematic position\nis supported by the cladistic analysis, showing that Nothobartsia\nrepresents a relatively primitive genus standing close to the common\nancestral root of Bartsia, Euphrasia, and Odontites.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothobartsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1591.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothobartsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1592.phy"}]}
