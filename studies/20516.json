Phylogenetic analysis of\nthe concatenated sequence data provided the same resolution as SCGs. Six\nSCGs were present only in California, two only in Mexico, and one in\nboth California and Mexico. An isolate associated with the most common\nSCG in California was tested for pathogenicity on blueberry, raspberry,\nstrawberry and lettuce. All blueberry, raspberry and lettuce plants that\nwere inoculated remained healthy, but two of the five strawberry\ncultivars tested developed symptoms. The three strawberry cultivars that\nwere resistant to the blackberry pathogen were also resistant to F.\noxysporum f. sp. fragariae, the cause of Fusarium wilt of strawberry. We\npropose to designate strains of F. oxysporum that are pathogenic to\nblackberry as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. mori forma specialis nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium oxysporum IGS-TUB-TEF ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101819.phy"}]}
