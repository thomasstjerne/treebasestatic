In this study, we successfully isolated cultures of this fungal\ngroup via basidiospore isolation. We tested four Harushimeji species\nwith modified Norkranss C (MNC) medium and MNC medium containing\nn-butyric acid. Colony formation was observed on 22 of 25 basidioma\nsamples; however, most exhibited slow and unsteady growth. The isolated\nmycelia contained dikaryotic hyphae and were identified through\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer\nregion of fungal ribosomal RNA. Six isolates showed steady growth and\nwere deposited in the fungal culture collection of the Fungus/Mushroom\nResource and Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Tottori\nUniversity, Japan, as Tottori University Fungal Culture Collection\nstrains. These results indicate that basidiospore isolation is a useful\nmethod for obtaining Harushimeji strains.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115584","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115584.phy"}]}
