Based\non morphology and DNA sequence data of β-tubulin (tub2) and actin (act),\nfive Phaeoacremonium species were identified including Phaeoacremonium\nminimum (22 isolates), P. venezuelense (19 isolates), P. parasiticum (17\nisolates), P. australiense (8 isolates) and P. iranianum (4 isolates).\nThe latter two species (P. australiense and P. iranianum) were reported\nfor the first time in Algeria. Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS,\ntub2, tef1) and morphological features, allowed the description of the\nthree isolates belonging to the genus Cadophora (WAMC34, WAMC117 and\nWAMC118) as a novel species, namely Cadophora sabaouae sp. nov. All the\nidentified species were pathogenic on grapevine cuttings.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130076.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130077.phy"}]}
