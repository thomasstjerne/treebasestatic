Our analyses included 46 species representing\nall genera of Polytrichales. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with\nsimultaneous parsimony analyses of all sequences plus morphology and\nseparate combinations of sequence data only. Results lend support for\nrecognition of Polytrichales as a monophyletic entity. Oedipodium\ngriffithianum appears as a sister taxon to Polytrichales or as a sister\ntaxon of all mosses excluding Sphagnales and Andreaeles. Within\nPolytrichales Alophosia and Atrichopsis, species without the adaxial\nlamellae (in Atrichopsis present but poorly developed on male\ngametophyte) otherwise typical of the group, are sister to the remaining\nspecies followed by a clade including Bartramiopsis and Lyellia, species\nwith adaxial lamellae covering only the central portion of the leaves.\nSix taxa with an exclusively southern hemisphere distribution form a\ngrade between the basal lineages and a clade including genera that are\nmostly confined to the northern hemisphere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"another EPT","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polytrichales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1999.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polytrichales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2000.phy"}]}
