The new taxon is\nnot closely related to any other genus in floras of Middle Asia or\nadjacent countries. The analyses of fruit morphology and anatomy and\nnrDNA ITS sequence data reveal a distant affinity to genera in the\ninformal Ligusticeae group. In particular, Kuramosciadium is most\nsimilar to Sphaenolobium, Paulita, and Seselopsis. Kuramosciadium\ncorydalifolium appears to be very rare, narrowly endemic, and its\nnatural populations are in need protection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Foe41 751b cut","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kuramosciadium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21613.phy"}]}
