Pluteus brunneosquamulosus of sect. Celluloderma is\ncharacterized by the squamulose, ‘Lepiota-like’, pileus, subglobose to\nbroadly ellipsoid spores, cheilocystidia with a long flexuous neck and\nlageniform or narrowly utriform caulocystidia. Pluteus velutinus belongs\nin sect. Hispidoderma and is unique in its shallowly depressed,\nhygrophanous, orange-brown, , squamulose pileus, the pleurocystidia very\ncommonly provided with an apical digitate projection up to 10 μm long or\ntapering towards apex and the pileipellis as a trichoderm or\ntrichohymeniderm. P. chrysaegis from India and P. conizatus var.\nafricanus from Africa are considered synonymous based on morphological\nand molecular evidence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Celluloderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57299.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hispidoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57300.phy"}]}
