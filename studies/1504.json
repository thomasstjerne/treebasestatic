This study\ntested the division of Cupressus into an Old World clade and a New World\nclade with complete sampling of the 28 extant species. Data from\nanatomy, biochemistry, micromorphology, reproductive development,\nreproductive morphology, and vegetative morphology were combined with\nmolecular sequence data (matK, NEEDLY intron 2, nrITS, rbcL, and trnL)\nto produce the most complete hypothesis of evolutionary relationships\nwithin Cupressoideae to date. Callitropsis, Cupressus, and Juniperus\nformed a well–supported monophyletic group (100%). Within this clade,\nthe only demonstrably monophyletic genus was Juniperus (100%). Monophyly\nof the 12 Old World species of Cupressus was well supported (100%). Old\nWorld species of Cupressus were sister to Juniperus (99%). Callitropsis\nand the 16 New World species of Cupressus were resolved as the sister\ngroup to the Old World Cupressus plus Juniperus (100%) clade—rendering\nCupressus polyphyletic. The relationship between Callitropsis and the\nNew World species of Cupressus was not resolved. Based on the results of\nthe combined analysis generic circumscriptions were modified: Cupressus\nwas restricted exclusively to Old World species and Callitropsis was\nexpanded to include the New World species previously classified as\nCupressus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TNT12","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_935.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT11","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_936.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT10","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_937.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT9","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_938.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT8","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_939.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT7","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_940.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT6","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_941.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT5","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_942.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT4","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_943.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT3","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_944.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_945.phy"},{"tree_label":"TNT1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_946.phy"}]}
