This is reflected in an\nincreasing number of species described over time, especially fungi.\nDespite these facts, a very limited number of species in specialized\nspider-parasitic Gibellula has ever been reported from the country. A\nsurvey of invertebrate-pathogenic fungi in Thailand for several decades\nhas enabled us to find a number of fungal specimens with affinities to\nthe genus. Integrating morphological traits into multi-locus\nphylogenetic analysis uncovered four new species consisting of G.\npigmentosinum, G. cebrennini, G. fusiformispora and G. scorpioides. All\nthese appeared to be exclusively linked with torrubiella-like sexual\nmorphs with the presence of Granulomanus asexual morph in G.\npigmentosinum and G. cebrennini. In addition to these, our current study\nremarkably exhibited high host specificity of these new species towards\ntheir spider hosts and revealed the evidence of manipulation of host\nbehavior in G. scorpioides for the first time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123884","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123884.phy"}]}
