The\ngroup Eumycota, including the traditional taxa Hyphochytriomycetes,\nChytridio-mycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, is\ndefined by two synapomorphies, molecular weight Or 25S RNA, and chitin\ncell walls. Some groups are supported as monophyletic; Eumycota,\nAmastigomycota, Dicaryomycotina, Ascomycetes, Protobasidiomycetes,\nBasidiomycetes, Euascomycetidae, Hymenomycetidae and\nHomobasidiomycetales. The Hyphochytriomycota is the sister group to\nremaining groups. The Taphrinaceae and Saccharomycetaceae are more\nclosely related to the Basidiomycetes than to any of the ascomycetous\ngroups. In the absence of unique character sets groups such as the\nMastigomycotina, Hemiascomycetes, Ustomycetes, Holobasidiomycetes,\nHeterobasidiomyceles, Phragmobasidiomycetes and the Teliomycetes cannot\nbe maintained and are abandoned as paraphyletic. Characters and terminal\ntaxa used for the analysis are defined and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eumycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_273.phy"}]}
