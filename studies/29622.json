The characteristics of Hermanssonia fimbriata\ninclude annual, resupinate basidioma, a monomitic hyphal system, and\noblong ellipsoid basidiospores of 56 × 2.43 μm. Its basidioma changes\ndrastically upon drying, from being a light-coloured, juicy, with a very\npapillose and wrinkled hymenophore, to dark-coloured and more or less\nsmooth hymenophore. The characteristics of Phlebia austroasiana include\nannual, resupinate basidioma with clay-buff dry aculei, 23 aculei per\nmm, a monomitic hyphal system, tubular cystidia of 2025 × 33.5 µm, and\noblong ellipsoid basidiospores of 4.45.2 × 2.13 μm. The phylogenetic\nanalyses based on the combined 2-locus dataset [ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) +\nnuclear large subunit RNA (nLSU)] confirm the placement of two new\nspecies respectively in Hermanssonia and Phlebia. Phylogenetically the\nclosely related species to the two new species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136226.phy"}]}
