Recently, we demonstrated that Tuberculina represents the asexual\nlife stage of the plant-parasitic genus Helicobasidium. Here we reveal\nhost specificity of Tuberculina and Helicobasidium species on rust\nfungal hosts by means of infection experiments and molecular analyses.\nWe inoculated species of the rust genera Chrysomyxa, Coleosporium,\nCronartium, Gymnosporangium, Puccinia, Tranzschelia, and Uromyces with\nconidia and with basidiospores of Helicobasidium longisporum and H.\npurpureum, and with conidia of Tuberculina maxima, T. persicina, and T.\nsbrozzii. In addition, we analyzed base sequences from the ITS region of\nthe nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA of 51 Tuberculina and\nHelicobasidium specimens collected in the field together with the\nsequences from the Tuberculina infections obtained in the infection\nexperiments. The data show that there are at least six monophyletic\nlineages within the Tuberculina/Helicobasidium-group that are\nunambiguously distinguished by molecular and morphological characters\nand a specific host spectrum of the Tuberculina-stage. The thereby\nrevealed diversity opens up new vistas on the evolution of that\nexceptional mycoparasitic-phytoparasitic fungal group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helicobasidium/Tuberculina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1785.phy"}]}
