Three Phytophthora taxa\nand all downy mildew taxa were excluded from the previously recognized\nsubgeneric clades of Phytophthora, though all were strongly supported\nwithin the paraphyletic genus. Downy mildews appear to be polyphyletic,\nwith graminicolous downy mildews (GDM), brassicolous downy mildews (BDM)\nand downy mildews with colored conidia (DMCC) forming a clade with the\npreviously unplaced Phytophthora taxon totara; downy mildews with\npyriform haustoria (DMPH) were placed in their own clade with affinities\nto the obligate biotrophic P. cyperi. Results suggest the recognition of\nfour additional clades within Phytophthora, but few relationships\nbetween clades could be resolved. Trees containing all twenty extant\ndowny mildew genera were produced by adding partial coverage of\nseventeen additional downy mildew taxa; these trees supported the\nmonophyly of the BDMs, DMCCs and DMPHs but suggested that the GDMs are\nparaphyletic in respect to the BDMs or polyphyletic. Incongruence\nbetween nuclear-only and mitochondrial-only trees suggests introgression\nmay have occurred between several clades, particularly those containing\nbiotrophs, questioning whether obligate biotrophic parasitism and other\ntraits with polyphyletic distributions arose independently or were\nhorizontally transferred. Phylogenetic approaches may be limited in\ntheir ability to resolve some of the complex relationships between the\n“subgeneric” clades of Phytophthora, which include twenty downy mildew\ngenera and hundreds of species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig3_2of2_MrBayes.tre","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig3_2of2_MrBayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig2_3of3_phylobayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig2_3of3_phylobayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106991.phy"},{"tree_label":"S1Fig_no3rdcodons_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S1Fig_no3rdcodons_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106992.phy"},{"tree_label":"S2Fig_1of2_nuclear-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S2Fig_1of2_nuclear-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig2_2of3_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig2_2of3_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106990.phy"},{"tree_label":"S3Fig_2of2_mitochondrial-only_MrBayes.tre","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S3Fig_2of2_mitochondrial-only_MrBayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107004.phy"},{"tree_label":"S2Fig_2of2_mitochondrial-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S2Fig_2of2_mitochondrial-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 1 of 3","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora Fig2_1of3_garli.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106989.phy"},{"tree_label":"S11Fig_lsu-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S11Fig_lsu-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106995.phy"},{"tree_label":"S12Fig_btub-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S12Fig_btub-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106996.phy"},{"tree_label":"S13Fig_cox2-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S13Fig_cox2-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106997.phy"},{"tree_label":"S15Fig_rps10-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S15Fig_rps10-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106999.phy"},{"tree_label":"S14Fig_nad9-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S14Fig_nad9-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106998.phy"},{"tree_label":"S16Fig_secY-only_mrbayes.tre","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S16Fig_secY-only_mrbayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107000.phy"},{"tree_label":"S3Fig_1of2_nuclear-only_MrBayes.tre","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"S3Fig_1of2_nuclear-only_MrBayes.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107001.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig3_1of2_Garli.tre","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig3_1of2_Garli.tre","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107002.phy"}]}
