Phylogenetic species are supported by both a multi-locus\ntree-based method and Bayesian species delimitation. Lactifluus volemus\nand L. oedematopus are provided with a new description, and a third\nspecies, L. subvolemus, is described as new to science. Lactifluus\noedematopus can be easily recognized by its short pileipellis hairs.\nBoth L. volemus and L. subvolemus have longer pileipellis hairs and can\nonly be distinguished from each other based on cap colour. Intermediary\ncolour forms, however, occur as well, and cannot be identified as either\nL. volemus or L. subvolemus without molecular data. Revealing that L.\nvolemus  already considered extinct in the Netherlands and the Belgian\nFlemish region, and declining in other European countries  is actually a\ncomplex of three species that are even more vulnerable to extinction,\nthis study emphasizes the fundamental role of taxonomy in species\nconservation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.2","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree based on the combined analysis of ITS, LSU and\nrpb2 sequence data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89166.phy"}]}
