{"Authors":" Christian Printzen","Year":" 2014","Title":" A molecular phylogeny of the lichen genus Biatora including\nsome morphologically similar species","Journal":" The Lichenologist","Volume":" 46","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Ramalinaceae, Lecidea s. lat., Bacidia, Mycobilimbia, ITS,\nRPB2, mrSSU","DOI":"","Abstract":" The lichen genus Biatora comprises inconspicuous crustose\nlichens that are typically found on organic substrata such as tree bark,\nbryophytes and detritus. During the last 20 years many new species have\nbeen added to the genus making its delimitation more and more difficult.\nThe infrageneric relationships of the 42 species have never been\ninvestigated thoroughly. I use DNA sequences from three gene loci (ITS,\nRPB2, mrSSU) and 59 OTUs to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships\nof Biatora and its infrageneric groups. Cliostomum appears to be the\nclosest relative of Biatora. The position of Mycobilimbia in the\nLecania-clade is confirmed. Phylogenetic relationships within Biatora\nare poorly supported, but six different species groups that are also\nphenotypically distinguished are more or less well supported: the\nvernalis-, meiocarpa-, hertelii-, ocelliformis-, beckhausii- and\nrufidula-group. The analysis also confirms the presence of several\nundescribed taxa. Biatora subduplex as currently circumscribed appears\nto be heterogeneous, as does B. helvola. Based on the phylogeny, the\ndistributional range of B. alaskana is extended to Japan. The new\ncombinations Biatora ementiens (Nyl.) Printzen and Biatora hemipolia\n(Nyl.) S. Ekman & Printzen are made.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MCMC consensus tree","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MCMC consensus tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_68833.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML bootstrap consensus tree","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML bootstrap consensus tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_68835.phy"}]}
