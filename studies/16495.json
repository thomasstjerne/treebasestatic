After\nreexamination of this species based on both morphological characters and\nmolecular phylogenetic evidence, we conclude that Allopsalliota should\nbe considered a synonym of Micropsalliota, and we propose the transfer\nof Allopsalliota geesterani into Micropsalliota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78381","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78381.phy"}]}
