Research conducted on P. clematidina as a potential\nbiocontrol agent against C. vitalba, led to the discovery of two\nperithecial-forming strains. To assess the diversity of P. clematidina\nand to clarify the teleomorph-anamorph relationship, phylogenetic\nanalyses of 18 P. clematidina strains, reference strains representing\nthe Phoma sections in the Didymellaceae, and strains of related species\nassociated with Clematis were conducted. Partial sequences of the ITS1,\nITS2 and 5.8S rRNA gene, the ÃŸ-tubulin gene and 28S rRNA gene were used\nto clarify intra- and inter-species relationships. These analyses\nrevealed that P. clematidina resolves into three well-supported clades\nwhich appear to be linked to differences in host specificity. Based on\nthese findings, Didymella clematidis is newly described, and the\ndescriptions of P. clematidina and D. vitalbina are amended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phoma, MPT of ITS, BT, and LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6428.phy"}]}
