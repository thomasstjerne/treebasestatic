But since\nmorphological characters are subject to natural selection for function\nand arise from the expression of developmental pathways, they may not be\nindependent, a situation that may amplify any underlying homoplasy.\nHere, we use new dental and multi-locus genetic data from bats\n(Mammalia: Chiroptera) to quantify saturation and similarity in\nmorphological characters and introduce two likelihood-based approaches\nto identify strongly conflicting characters and integrate morphological\nand molecular data. We implement these methods to analyze the phylogeny\nof incomplete Miocene fossils in the radiation of Phyllostomidae (New\nWorld Leaf-nosed Bats), perhaps the most ecologically diverse family of\nliving mammals. Morphological characters produced trees incongruent with\nmolecular phylogenies, were saturated, and showed rates of change higher\nthan most molecular substitution rates. Dental characters encoded\nvariation similar to that in other morphological characters, while\nmolecular characters encoded highly dissimilar variation in comparison.\nSaturation and high rates of change indicate randomization of\nphylogenetic signal in the morphological data, and extensive similarity\nsuggests characters are non-independent and errors are amplified. To\nintegrate the morphological data into tree building while accounting for\nhomoplasy, we used statistical molecular scaffolds and combined\nphylogenetic analyses excluding a small subset of strongly conflicting\ndental characters. The phylogenies revealed the Miocene nectar-feeding\nPalynephyllum nests within the crown nectar-feeding South American\nsubfamily Lonchophyllinae, while the Miocene genus Notonycteris is\nsister to the extant carnivorous Vampyrum. These relationships imply new\ncalibration points for timing of radiation of the ecologically diverse\nPhyllostomidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B combined minus 32 chars ML","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Both molecular and morphological data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75072.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A ML combined","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Both molecular and morphological data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75071.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B Bayesian combined no clock","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Both molecular and morphological data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75070.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A Statistical scaffold","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Both molecular and morphological data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75069.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp. Fig. 4B MLT","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Morphological data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75067.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp. Fig. 4A MPT","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Morphological","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp. Fig. 4C Bayesian allcompatible consensus","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Morphological","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75066.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp. Fig. 2","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera Bayesian molecular non-clock","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75068.phy"}]}
