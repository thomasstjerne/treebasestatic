This\nspecies is similar in general appearance to P. rufescens and P.\nmembranacea, but may be recognized by its downturned lobe tips and\nnarrow lobes, respectively. Most thalli are bright emerald green in\ncolour when moist, although a dark khaki green colourmorph is also\ndocumented. Monophyly of P. islandica s. lat. (i.e. including P. sp. A\nsensu OBrien et al., from Canada) is significantly supported based on\nITS sequences and corroborated by molecular synapomorphy (absence of the\nITS1 hypervariable region). Analysis of the rbcLX locus indicates the\ncyanobiont of P. islandica (Nostoc sp.) comprises strains belonging to a\npool of Icelandic genotypes, some of which are present in other\nPeltigera species, including P. “neorufescens”, another taxon new to\nIceland collected during this study. Association with photobionts that\nare shared by other local species suggests P. islandica may be well\nestablished in Iceland, but a review of herbarium collections as well as\nbroader field surveys are needed to better characterize its geographical\ndistribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peltigera islandica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95395.phy"}]}
