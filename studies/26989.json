In this study, we introduce a\nnovel species viz.Â Ophioceras sichuanense based on morphological\ncomparison coupled with multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. The species\nforms a distinct lineage basal to Ophioceras with high statistic\nsupports (98% ML, 1.00 PP). Ophioceras sichuanense occurs on submerged\ndecaying branches of bamboo in Sichuan, China. Ceratosphaerella\ncastillensis and C. rhizomorpha form a subclade within Ophioceras and\ntherefore, Ceratosphaerella is synonymized under Ophioceras. The\nphylogenetic relationships of Ophioceras are discussed in relation to\nmorphological similarities of genera in Magnaporthales. An updated\nphylogenetic tree of Magnaporthales is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131006","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131006.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131007.phy"}]}
