Post-translational\nglycosylation of flagellin, the main structural protein of the\nflagellum, is a common characteristic among many Gram-negative bacteria\nand Archaea. Several distinct functions have been ascribed to flagellin\nglycosylation, including stabilisation and maintenance of the flagellar\nfilament, motility, surface recognition, adhesion, and virulence.\nHowever, little is known about this trait among Gram-positive\nbacteria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geobacillus Supp PseCI phylogeny ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99582.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geobacillus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geobacillus Geo MLST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99581.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geobacillus FGIUPGMATB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99584.phy"}]}
