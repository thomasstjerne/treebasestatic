Fungi hold a key role in\nforest ecosystem. However, they are in tropical forests to date\nrelatively little studied and thus merit special attention. During a\nsurvey of polypores in continuous near-natural rainforests in natural\nreserve of Kaw, French Guiana, we collected a remarkable polypore,\ncharacterized by a lateral stipe and numerous small black scales on its\nflabelliform pileus. It is here described as Polyporus minutosquamosus,\nnova species. In phylogenetic trees, based on combined ITS and partial\nnLSU rDNA sequences, it is nested within the Polyporus sensu lato clade,\nbut does not belong to any of the four subclades distinguished within\nthis clade. A key to species of the genus Polyporus in tropical America\nis provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87946","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87946.phy"}]}
