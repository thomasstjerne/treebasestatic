Eight most\nparsimonious trees 569 steps long were obtained, with a consistency\nindex of 72%. Groups in the tree are not congruent with previous\nclassification schemes of species in the genus, based on a small number\nof morphological characters. For this subset of Haematoleochus,\nplesiomorphic hosts are species of the genus Rana, with two\ncolonizations to other amphibian groups. African species appear to have\ndiverged following separation of Gondwana and Laurasia. Therefore, South\nAmerican species should appear as closest relatives of African species\nwhen included in the analysis. Presented evidence suggests an ancestral\nwide distribution of North American representatives of the group,\nfollowed by successive contraction, amplification and fragmentation of\nranges and speciation events as the result of the intense volcanic\nactivity in the central part of Mexico since late Tertiary, drying\nclimate of Western and Central U.S.A. and North-Western Mexico from the\nearly Eocene to the Pleistocene, and the glaciation during the\nPleistocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haematoloechus spp 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4099.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haematoloechus spp 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4098.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haematoloechus spp 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4100.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haematoloechus spp 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4101.phy"}]}
