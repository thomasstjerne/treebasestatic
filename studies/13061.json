A new basal ornithopod, Haya griva, gen. et sp. nov., is described\nhere based on several well-preserved specimens from the Late Cretaceous\nJavkhlant Formation of Mongolia. Haya is diagnosed by a unique\ncombination of characters, some of which are also present in other Asian\nCretaceous basal ornithopods such as a bifid caudal ramus of the jugal\nand a tapering and beveled predentary. Traits, such as presence of\nseparate maxillary fenestra, otherwise only known in Hypsilophodon, show\nmore homoplastic distributions. Phylogenetic analysis provides weak\nsupport for grouping Haya with the Chinese Cretaceous taxa Jeholosaurus\nand Changchunsaurus, suggesting a greater hidden diversity of such\nanimals in Asia. The most complete prepared specimen of Haya exhibits a\nsizeable gastrolith mass, representing only the second occurrence among\nornithopods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7A","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithischia phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55336.phy"}]}
