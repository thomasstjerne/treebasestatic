Our results show that macromorphology of\nfruiting bodies and hymenophore construction do not reflect monophyletic\ngroups. However, by integrating micromorphology and re-defining genera,\nharmonization of DNA phylogeny and morphological genus concepts is\npossible in most cases. In the case of one genus (Phlebiopsis), our\ngenetic markers could not resolve genus limits satisfactorily and a\nclear morphological definition could not be identified.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae ITS-LSU-RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100247.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hapalopilus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100244.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100245.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaetaceae ITS-LSU-RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100246.phy"}]}
