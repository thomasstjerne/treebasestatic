In this study we evaluated the phylogeny of the tribe\nand assessed hypotheses regarding its affinity to clavicipitalean\nteleomorphic groups. To support phylogenetic analyses, morphology of\nrepresentatives of several key species of Ustilaginoideae was examined\nalso. Phylogenetic analyses using sequences of the large subunit of the\nribosomal RNA gene suggest that members of Ustilaginoideae are distinct\nfrom teleomorphic genera of Clavicipitaceae and that Ustilaginoideae\nshould be recognized as a monophyletic group within Hypocreales.\nHowever, phylogenetic analyses did not resolve the placement of\nUstilaginoideae in Clavicipitaceae or Hypocreaceae, suggesting that it\nmight be a distinct lineage within Hypocreales. This evaluation\nsupported the monophyly of tribes Balansieae and Clavicipeae in the\nfamily Clavicipitaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Anamorphic Tribe Ustilaginoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4438.phy"}]}
