Monoplacophora show marked seriality of ctenidia, atria,\nmuscles and nephridia and this has been interpreted as plesiomorphic for\nMollusca, reflecting a segmented ancestry. More recently this seriality,\nalso partly seen in Polyplacophora, has been seen as a derived\ncondition. Analysis of the first published monoplacophoran DNA sequence\nfrom Laevilipilina antarctica War√©n & Hain, 1992 (Giribet et al.,\n2006, 103: 7723; doi:10.1073/pnas.0602578103), showed Monoplacophora\ninside Polyplacophora. These taxa were then grouped under the name\nSerialia, reflecting the hypothesis that their seriality is a\nsynapomorphy. Subsequent examination revealed that part of the L.\nantarctica published sequence was the result of contamination with\nPolyplacophora (Giribet, Supplementary Material S1). We collected and\nsequenced another monoplacophoran, Laevipilina hyalina McLean, 1979,\nresulting in the first multi-gene dataset representing all molluscan\nclasses. Our analyses did not show unambiguous support for Serialia.\nModel-based approaches strongly supported Serialia as a clade, however,\nparsimony analyses under dynamic and static homology did not resolve the\nposition of Monoplacophora. Although our study provides support for\nSerialia and none for Conchifera, it appears that further resolution of\nmolluscan relationships will require large increases of data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1, 2 BayesMJ","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, MUSCLE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6848.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MP Strict","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, MUSCLE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6709.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP shortest TCoffee","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6712.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes MJ GB/MUSC","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, GB/MUSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6765.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supp5 POY","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6728.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes MJ TCoffee","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, TCoffee","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6940.phy"},{"tree_label":"RaxML GB/MUSC","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, GB/MUSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6796.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 RaxML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, TCoffee","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6805.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 RaxML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, MUSCLE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6937.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict GB/MUSC","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mollusca, GB/MUSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6826.phy"}]}
