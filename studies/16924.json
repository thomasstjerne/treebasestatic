One problem in the production of algae\nfor biofuels is attacks by algal parasitoids that can cause population\ncrashes when algae are cultivated in outdoor ponds (Greenwell et\nal. 2010). Integrated solutions are being sought to mitigate this\nproblem, and an initial step is pest identification. We isolated an\nalgal parasitoid from an open pond of Scenedesmus dimorphus used for\nbiofuel production in New Mexico, and examined its morphology,\nultrastructure, and molecular phylogeny. A phylogenetic analysis placed\nthis organism in Aphelida as conspecific with Amoeboaphelidium\nprotococcarum sensu Karpov et al. 2013. As a result, we re-evaluated the\ntaxonomy of Amoeboaphelidium protococcarum sensu Letcher et al. 2013,\nand here designate it as a new species, Amoeboaphelidium\noccidentale.","trees":[{"tree_label":"best","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80844","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_80844.phy"}]}
