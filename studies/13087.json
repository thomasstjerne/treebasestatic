{"Authors":" Joel F. Gibson, Jeffrey H.

A cladistic analysis of 117 morphological characters recorded from\n154 species, including representatives of 58 genera and subgenera\nrecovers a phylogenetic hypothesis for the family. This hypothesis is\nused as the basis of a new classification for the family. Both Sicini\nand Zodionini are removed from Myopinae and elevated to subfamilial\nstatus. A new tribe, Thecophorini, is proposed within Myopinae to\naccommodate Thecophora, Scatoccemyia, and Pseudoconops. Two genera,\nPseudomyopa and Parazodion, are removed from Dalmanniinae and placed in\nMyopinae and Zodioninae respectively. Conopinae is divided into eleven\ntribes, seven of which are newly described (Asiconopini, Caenoconopini,\nGyroconopini, Microconopini, Neoconopini, and Siniconopini). Some\nexamined species are transferred to different or new genera and\nsubgenera. A new genus, Schedophysoconops, and subgenus Asiconops\n(Aegloconops), within Conopinae are described. A review of character\nevolution and phylogeography is included in light of the new\nclassification. A catalogue of all genus-group names is included with\nnew emendations noted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tnt
