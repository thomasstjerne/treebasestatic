Identification of Melampsora species is\noften complicated due to little differences in spore morphology and few\npublicly available comparative sequence data. Weeping willow trees\n(primarily Salix babylonica) have been reported to be infected by 11\nMelampsora species; however, most of those records are based on\nmorphological characterization. New collections of rust fungi on weeping\nwillows from the central USA were analyzed using a combination of\nmorphology, ITS and LSU rDNA sequencing, and host data to determine that\nthey represent an undescribed rust fungus, Melampsora ferrinii sp. nov.\nHost plant identification was confirmed by a combination of morphology\nand rbcL-atpB intergenic spacer region sequence data, and a phylogenetic\nanalysis of Salix babylonica and its relatives is included. Additional\nstudies of herbarium material revealed that M. ferrinii has been\noccasionally collected but misidentified as M. epitea. In addition to\nNorth America, M. ferrinii is also present in South America and has been\ninfecting weeping willows there since at least the 1990s.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melampsora ferrinii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97563.phy"}]}
