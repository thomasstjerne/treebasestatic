The ascomata were similar to M. kalasinense\nin its host preference for elaterids, olive-green clavate stromata, and\nobliquely immersed perithecia, but the asci and ascospores were\nsignificantly shorter in length than those of the latter species.\nFurthermore, phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed\nspacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the elongation factor 1-alpha\ngene showed that the Japanese species was phylogenetically distinctive\nin the M. anisopliae lineage, including M. kalasinense. Accordingly, we\ndescribe a new species, M. brachyspermum. Isolates of this species\nproduced olive-green conidial masses on the surface of the colony. Also,\nhyphal anastomoses between two metulae were often observed on\nconidiophores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metarhizium brachyspermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121060.phy"}]}
