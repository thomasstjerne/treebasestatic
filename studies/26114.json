In this study, we performed a Bayesian phylogenetic\nanalysis of 35 isolates in the Pythium hyphal swelling group, 7 P.\nintermedium isolates, and 6 Pythium attrantheridium isolates using DNA\nsequences from multiple loci. We also performed morphological\nobservations and mating tests. Our results showed that all the isolates\nformed one large clade but were divided into 3 subclades. Furthermore,\nwe observed many mating reactions between isolates from different\nsubclades, including between P. attrantheridium and P. intermedium.\nTherefore, we suggest that P. intermedium and P. attrantheridium belong\nto a single biological species that consists of 3 phylogenetic species.\nThis is the first report of a phylogenetic complex within the P.\nintermedium species and will be helpful in understanding the evolution\nof Pythium species in natural ecosystems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123169.phy"}]}
