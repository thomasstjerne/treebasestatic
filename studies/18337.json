Dozens of novel species\ndescriptions of this genus were published in the last couple of years,\nbut few utilized genomic data as classification criteria. Here we\ndemonstrate the importance of using genome-based metrics and\nphylogenetic analyses to identify and classify Paenibacillus strains.\nFor this purpose, Paenibacillus riograndensis SBR5T, Paenibacillus\nsonchi X19-5T, and their close relatives were compared through\nphenotypic, genotypic and genomic approaches. With respect to P. sonchi\nX19-5T, P. riograndensis SBR5T, Paenibacillus sp. CAR114, and\nPaenibacillus sp. CAS34 presented ANI (average nucleotide identity)\nvalues ranging from 95.61% to 96.32%, gANI (whole-genome average\nnucleotide identity) values ranging from 96.78% to 97.31%, and dDDH\n(digital DNA-DNA hybridization) values ranging from 68.2% to 73.2%.\nPhylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, gyrB, recA, recN, and rpoB genes and\nconcatenated proteins supported the monophyletic origin of these\nPaenibacillus strains. Therefore, we propose to assign Paenibacillus sp.\nCAR114 and Paenibacillus sp. CAS34 to P. sonchi species, and reclassify\nP. riograndensis SBR5T as a later heterotypic synonym of P. sonchi (type\nstrain X19-5T), with the creation of three novel genomovars,\nPaenibacillus sonchi genomovar Sonchi (type strain X19-5T),\nPaenibacillus sonchi genomovar Riograndensis (type strain SBR5T),\nPaenibacillus sonchi genomovar Oryzarum (type strain CAS34T = DSM\n102041T; = BR10511T).","trees":[{"tree_label":"gyrB","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus gyrB ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101158.phy"},{"tree_label":"rpoB","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus rpoB ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101160.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S rRNA","ntax":"160","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus 16S ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101161.phy"},{"tree_label":"Amphora","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amphora ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101159.phy"},{"tree_label":"recN","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus recN ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101163.phy"},{"tree_label":"recA","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus recA ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101164.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paenibacillus Core-protein NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105936.phy"}]}
