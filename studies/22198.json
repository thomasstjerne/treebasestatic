Its phylogenetic relationships are poorly known.\nWe revised Orleanesia and performed molecular and morphological\nphylogenetic analyses with the purpose of clarifying the interspecific\nrelations within the genus and assessing its position within Laeliinae.\nWe used nrITS and plastidial matK regions, in addition to morphological\ncharacters, to estimate relationships. Orleanesia is monophyletic with\nCaularthron Raf. as its sister group. Orleanesia includes two clades,\nboth highly supported. Specimens from 14 herbaria were examined in\naddition to an analysis of digitized materials from another 13 herbaria.\nTwo lectotypifications and three new synonyms were proposed for the\ngenus, and the final number of species was reduced to six. Although none\nof the species of Orleanesia were considered endangered, it is clear\nthat their populations are threatened by deforestation and habitat\nreduction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"comb","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Orleanesia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111370.phy"}]}
