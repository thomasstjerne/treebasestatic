In\n2005, D. solani was isolated for the first time in Poland from a\nsymptomatic potato plant. This motivated us to study the presence and\ndiversity of Dickeya spp. in potato fields and water sources (including\nsurface waters near potato fields, and water from potato processing\nfacilities and sewage plants) in temperate regions of Poland (Central\nEurope). Only D. dianthicola and D. solani were isolated from\nsymptomatic potatoes, and only D. zeae and D. chrysanthemi were isolated\nfrom water sources. The Dickeya spp. isolated from potato formed a\nrelatively homogenous group, while those from water sources were quite\ndiverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive\ncharacterization of Dickeya spp. isolated from regions with a temperate\nclimate in Central Europe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"dnaX tree","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"dnaX tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87090.phy"}]}
