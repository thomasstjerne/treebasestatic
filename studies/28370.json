Phylogenetic analyses\nwere based on nuclear SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, and plastid‐encoded LSU rDNA.\nDNA sequences were obtained from species available in culture\ncollections (L. acus SAG 1224‐1a and UTEX 1316) and those isolated\ndirectly from the environment in Poland (48 isolates), resulting in 79\nnew sequences. The obtained phylogenetic tree of Lepocinclis included 27\ntaxa, five of which are presented for the first time (L. convoluta, L.\ngracillimoides, L. longissima, L. pseudospiroides, and L. torta) and\nnine taxonomically verified and described. Based on morphology,\nliterature data, and phylogenetic analyses, the following species were\ndistinguished: in the L. acus‐like group L. longissima, and L. acus; in\nthe L. tripteris‐like group, L. pseudospiroides, L. torta, and L.\ntripteris; in the L. oxyuris‐like group, L. gracillimoides, L. oxyuris\nvar. oxyuris, and L. oxyuris var. helicoidea. For all verified species,\ndiagnostic descriptions were emended, nomenclatural adjustments were\nmade, and epitypes were designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML Lepocinclis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131571.phy"},{"tree_label":"one gene ML tree","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131572","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131572.phy"}]}
