Morphological observations using light and scanning\nelectron microscopes and molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that\nthe fungus is a new species of the powdery mildew fungi with an unusual\nmorphology, described here as Erysiphe monascogera. Erysiphe monascogera\nhas a single ascus in a chasmothecium, but molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis and shape of hyphal appressoria suggest that this fungus is an\nErysiphe species. Erysiphe monascogera is a sister to E. nomurae on\nSymplocos chinensis var. leucocarpa f.Â pilosa, although there are\nobvious morphological differences between the two species. This\ninconsistency between molecular phylogeny and morphology may be\nexplained with the unique habitat of E. monascogera. Erysiphe\nmonascogera and E. nomurae are included in a clade composed of the E.\nalphitoides species complex, which suggests that these two species were\ndiverged by host jumping of the E. alphitoides species complex having\noaks as major host plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4955.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4956.phy"}]}
