Leucocybe is proposed to accommodate\nthe clade formed by Clitocybe connata and C. candicans. Clitocybe\ninornata is invested as type species of Atractosporocybe, while the new\ngenus Rhizocybe is proposed for the former species of the section Vernae\nof Clitocybe, C. vermicularis, C. pruinosa and C. rhizoides. The three\nlineages are related to the families Lyophyllaceae and Entolomataceae,\nand independent from the Clitocybeae clade. Morphologically, Rhizocybe\nis characterized by the presence of conspicuous rhizomorphs, while\nAtractosporocybe presents long fusiform spores. Leucocybe includes two\nwhitish species in the former section Candicantes of Clitocybe, but no\nrelevant shared characteristic feature was detected. Other whitish\nclitocyboid species such as C. phyllophila (5 C. cerussata), C.\ndealbata, C. rivulosa, and Singerocybe hydrogramma, are shown to be\ngenetically related to the core lineage of the Clitocybeae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clitocybe ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74479.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clitocybe 28S nLSU-rpb2-tef1-18S nSSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74480.phy"}]}
