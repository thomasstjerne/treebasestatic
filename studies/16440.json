During the course of this time, the WRKY domain\nstructure, role in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, phylogeny, and\nregulation by various plant hormone pathways has been firmly\nestablished. While WRKY TFs have been demonstrated to regulate plant\nspecialized metabolism, the family is far less renowned for this role.\nAnalysis of WRKY TFs regulating production of specialized metabolites\nemphasizes the values of the family outside of traditionally accepted\nroles in stress tolerance. Overall, the WRKY family promises to play an\nessential role in regulation of important pharmaceutical, aromatherapy,\nbiofuel, and industrial components; thus, warranting considerable\nattention in the forthcoming years.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"606","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78393","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78393.phy"}]}
