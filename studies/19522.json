The new species\ndiffers from the most closely related species (i.e., Sachatamia\nalbomaculata and S. punctulata) by its green dorsal coloration in life\nwith yellow and blue dots, and unique semicirclular, white blotch in the\ndorsal portion of the iris. With this new species, we increase the\ncurrently recognized species in the genus to five. Mitochondrial DNA\nsequences corroborate both the phylogenetic position of the new species\nwithin Sachatamia and its status as a new species. In addition, in the\nlight of our results some taxonomic implications are briefly\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Appendix S2","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sachatamia_electricops","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97487.phy"}]}
