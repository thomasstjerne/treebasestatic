Machairasaurus leptonychus, gen. et sp. nov. is\ndiagnosed by slender, weakly curved manual unguals, reduced flexor\ntubercles, penulti- mate phalanges that are subequal in length to the\npreceding phalanges, and short, robust manual digits. Machairasaurus is\nfound to be a member of the Ingeniinae, along with Ingenia yanshini,\nHeyuannia huangi, Conchoraptor gracilis, and Nemegtomaia barsboldi.\nMachairasaurus exhibits un- usual proportions of the manus, suggesting\nthat the manus was not primarily used to grasp prey. Instead, Machaira-\nsaurus and other oviraptorids are likely to have fed largely on plant\nmaterial. The recognition of a previously unknown oviraptorid at Bayan\nMandahu provides further evidence that the Bayan Mandahu dinosaur\nassemblage is distinct from that found at the Djadokhta Formation\nexposures at Bayn Dzak, Tugriken Shireh, and Ukhaa Tolgod. Given that\nthese localities are separated by just a few hundred kilo- metres and\nrepresent similar palaeoenvironments, marked differences in the fauna\nsuggest that the Bayan Mandahu Formation of Inner Mongolia is not coeval\nwith the known Djadokhta localities in Mongolia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7A","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oviraptoridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55679.phy"}]}
