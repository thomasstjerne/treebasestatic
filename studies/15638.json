The numbers of insertion/deletions (Indels)\nidentified in the 7 isolates were also similar, ranging from 56 to 101.\nFifteen of the identified large Indels spanned PE-PPE-PGRS genes, which\nrepresents a major source of antigenic variability. Aside from SNPs and\nIndels, a CRISPR locus with varied spacers was observed in all 7\nclinical isolates, suggesting that they might play an important role in\nplasticity of the M. tuberculosis genome. The nucleotide diversity (Ð\nvalue) and selection intensity (dN/dS value) of the whole genome\nsequences of the 7 isolates were similar. The dN/dS values were less\nthan 1 for all 7 isolates (range from 0.608885 to 0.637365), confirming\nthe previous notion that M. tuberculosis genomes undergo purifying\nselection. While the Ð values and dN/dS values were comparable between\ndrug susceptible isolates and drug-resistant strains, there were\nsignificant differences between clinical isolates and lab strains.\nConclusions: In this study, though variations were observed among\ndifferent individual clinical M. tuberculosis isolates, no significant\ngeneralizable differences were observed between drug susceptible and\ndrug-resistant isolates on the genomic scale in terms of the\ndistribution of SNP, Indels, CRISPR-cas locus, as well as the nucleotide\ndiversity and selection intensity. Our study adds new knowledge on\ngenomic variability of M. tuberculosis strains and reveals novel\ninsights into the evolution of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis\ngenomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr73471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_73471.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr73468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_73468.phy"}]}
