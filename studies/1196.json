PCR primer sets for the mating-type genes MAT1-1-1 and\nMAT1-2-1 were designed based on the amino acid sequences of the\nconserved alpha and HMG boxes, respectively. The PCR-based mating-type\nassay could be applied for various clavicipitaceous genera (Balansia,\nClaviceps, Cordyceps and Epichloe. Most of the clavicipitaceous fungi\npossessed either MAT1-1-1 or MAT1-2-1, and were supposed to be\nheterothallic. Although the PCR products obtained by the mating-type\nassay were short, the phylogenetic trees of the mating-type genes gave\nbetter resolutions than that of 18S rDNA and agreed well to their\neconutritional modes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4399.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4400.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4401.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4402.phy"}]}
