This was\ndone by reconstructing the character evolution of the insertion on a\nphylogeny derived from rbcL sequences. Results suggest that the\ninsertion was gained once at the base of the Cyperaceae followed by\nmultiple losses in its most derived taxa. Despite several homoplastic\nloses (CI = 0.20), the pattern of insertion loss (RI = 0.88) and base\npair variation within the insertion were useful for defining sedge\nclades at various taxonomic levels. For example, whereas an indel loss\nappeared to characterise a major terminal clade within the Cyperaceae,\nboth insertion losses and sequence variation were consistent with\ninfrageneric clades previously discovered in an ITS phylogeny of the\ngenus Eleocharis. The presence/absence of the insertion also supported\nprevious conclusions based on morphological and molecular data that the\ntribe Scirpeae and the genus Scirpus s.l. are polyphyletic. In the\ncontext of our current understanding of Cyperaceae relationships,\nevolutionary patterns related to this insertion provide additional\nsupport for groups defined in prior phylogenetic analyses. Differences\nbetween maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses indicated that the\nparaphyly of Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, as detected in previous molecular\nanalyses, is based upon a chimeric rbcL sequence for the controversial\ngenus Oxychloe (Juncaceae). When the Cyperaceae portion of the molecule\nis removed, Juncaceae and Cyperaceae are monophyletic, with Oxychloe\npositioned within a Southern Hemisphere clade of single-flowered genera\nin the Juncaceae.
