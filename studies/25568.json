The\npaucity of relevant molecular data and unclear connections of sexual and\nasexual morphs present challenges in resolving taxa within this order.\nIn the present study, Patellariopsidaceae fam. nov., the asexual morph\nof Patellariopsis atrovinosa, and a new record of Cheirospora\nbotryospora (Vibrissiaceae) on Fagus sylvatica (Fagaceae) from Italy are\ndiscussed based on morphology and molecular phylogeny. Phylogenetic\nanalyses based on sequence data of combined LSU and ITS were used to\nimprove the phylogenetic resolution in the polyphyletic Helotiales. The\nresults of this research have paved a solid base to the taxonomy and\nphylogeny of Helotiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121306.phy"}]}
