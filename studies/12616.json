Plectocolea ochotensis Bakalin\net Vilnet described due to its intermediate position between Plectocolea\nand Solenostoma s. str. expressed by typical Solenostoma type perianth\nand presence of well-developed perigynium. The main diagnostic feature\nof S. major (S. Hatt.) Bakalin et Vilnet are deep purple rhizoids\ncoloration and wider than long, flattened, undulate and distant leaves.\nPlectocolea kurilensis (Bakalin) Bakalin et Vilnet evaluated at species\nlevel as species similar to P. infusca s. str., but differing from the\nlatter in smaller, grayish and more numerous oil-bodies, commonly\ndeflexed antical leaf margin and undulate leaves, mostly purplish to\nalmost purple rhizoids. At last P. ovalifolia (XXXX) Bakalin et Vilnet\nregarded as species with only very distant affinities to P. infusca s.\nstr. due to purple color of rhizoids in P. ovalifolia, other than\n“infusca”-type oil bodies, smaller plant size, more or less distant to\nrarely contiguous leaves, and ovate leaves versus lingulate to broadly\nor transversely elliptic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52350","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52350.phy"}]}
