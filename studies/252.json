The\nEmpetraceae are recognized as distinctive because of their often\nunisexual and wind-pollinated flowers. Epacridaceae are distinguished\nfrom Ericaceae by anthers that open by slits rather than pores and a\nprimarily Australian distribution. Phylogenetic relationships of these\nrelated families are investigated using nucleotide sequences of the\nplastid gene rbcL. Parsimony analyses indicate a monophyletic, broadly\ndefined Ericaceae that includes Empetraceae and Epacridaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1310.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1311.phy"}]}
