Fistulina\ntasmanica is distinguished by its pileate and fleshy basidiomata with\nrose pore surface, fibrous context, separated tubes, a monomitic hyphal\nsystem, subellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores (5.46 × 3.44 μm) which\nare negative in Melzers reagent and Cotton Blue. Phylogenetic analyses\ninferred from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and the\nlarge subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU) sequences also\nconfirmed that F. tasmanica is a new member within Fistulina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fistulina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118949.phy"}]}
