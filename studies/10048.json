For phylogenetic inferences, maximum parsimony\n(MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian MCMC analyses were performed.\nThe resultant trees are very similar and nearly concordant with the\ntraditional classification based on morphological characters. Our\nresults suggest that the Tachinidae are monophyletic and sister to the\nSarcophagidae. The tribal relationships within Exoristinae are in part\nsupported with high reliabilities and are similar to those inferred by\nStireman (2002). Based on the resultant trees, the phylogenetic\nrelationships and possible synapomorphies were investigated. Further, we\nevaluated the transformation of female reproductive habits in the\nExoristinae, finding support for the hypothesis that ovolarviparity\nevolved independently from oviparity in several clades and obtaining\ndiffering results about the evolutionary history of micro-ovolarviparity\ndepending on character optimization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exoristinae, manual","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6064.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. SI2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exoristinae, clustal","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6046.phy"}]}
