We combined DNA sequences of clock- like genes for\nmost avian families with 130 fossil birds to generate a new time tree\nfor Neornithes and investigated their biogeographic and diversification\ndynamics. We found that the most recent common ancestor of modern birds\ninhabited South America around 95 million years ago, but it was not\nuntil the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition (66 million years ago) that\nNeornithes began to diversify rapidly around the world. Birds used two\nmain dis- persion routes: reaching the Old World through North America,\nand reaching Australia and Zealandia through Antarctica. Net\ndiversification rates increased during periods of global cooling,\nsuggesting that fragmentation of tropical biomes stimulated speciation.\nThus, we found pervasive evidence that avian evolution has been\ninfluenced by plate tectonics and environmental change, two basic\nfeatures of Earths dynamics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Birds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91681.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Birds","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91680.phy"}]}
