Both sexual and asexual stages of L.\nchinensis are observed, which is characterized by its broadly clavate to\nclavate, fusiform, hyaline and aseptate ascospores, and initially\nhyaline, aseptate, ovoid to ellipsoid conidia, which become pigmented\nand 1Â–2-septate with longitudinal striations when mature.\nPhylogenetically, L. chinensis closely related to L. pseudotheobromae,\nL. sterculiae and L. lignicola, and morphologically comparisons of these\nfour species lead to the conclusion that the collected taxon is\nnew.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
