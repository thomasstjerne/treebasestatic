The 14 species\ncurrently described have snout-vent lengths less than 18 mm and are\nthought to have evolved through miniaturization: an evolutionary process\nleading to an extremely small adult body size. Here, we present the\nfirst comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for Brachycephalus, using a\nmultilocus approach based on two nuclear (Rag-1 and Tyr) and three\nmitochondrial (Cyt b, 12S, and 16S rRNA) gene regions. Phylogenetic\nrelationships were inferred using a partitioned Bayesian analysis of\nconcatenated sequences and the hierarchical Bayesian method (BEST) that\nestimates species trees based on the multispecies coalescent model.\nIndividual gene trees showed conflict and also varied in resolution.\nWith the exception of the mitochondrial gene tree, no gene tree was\ncompletely resolved. The concatenated gene tree was completely resolved\nand is identical in topology and degree of statistical support to the\nindividual mtDNA gene tree. On the other hand, the BEST species tree\nshowed reduced significant node support relative to the concatenate tree\nand recovered a basal trichotomy, although some bipartions were\nsignificantly supported at the tips of the species tree. Comparison of\nthe log likelihoods for the concatenated and BEST trees suggests that\nthe method implemented in BEST explains the multilocus data for\nBrachycephalus better than the Bayesian analysis of concatenated data.\nGeometric morphometrics revealed marked variation in cranial shape\nbetween the species of Brachycephalus, and a statistically significant\nassociation between variation in cranial shape and genetic distances\nestimated from the mtDNA and nuclear loci. Notably, B. ephippium and B.\ngarbeana that are predicted to be sister-species in the individual and\nconcatenated gene trees and the BEST species tree share an evolutionary\nnovelty, the hyperossified dorsal plate.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44918.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44910.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44911.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44912","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44912.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44913.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44914","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44914.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44920.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44915.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44916.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44917.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr44919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_44919.phy"}]}
