The recent publication of\ngenome sequences of giraffe and okapi together afforded the opportunity\nto examine the evolution of selected TLRs in broad range of terrestrial\nungulates and cetaceans during their complex habitat diversification.\nThrough direct sequence comparisons and standard evolutionary\napproaches, the extent of nucleotide and protein sequence diversity in\nseven Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR3,TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10)\nbetween giraffe and closely related species was determined. In addition,\ncomparison of the patterning of key TLR motifs and domains between\ngiraffe and related species was performed. The quantification of\nselection pressure and divergence on TLRs among terrestrial ungulates\nand cetaceans was also performed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TLR 9 tree","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR9 guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101487.phy"},{"tree_label":"TLR2 tree","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR2 guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101485.phy"},{"tree_label":"TLR10 tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR10 guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101486.phy"},{"tree_label":"TLR7","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR7 guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101488.phy"},{"tree_label":"TLR4 tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR4 guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101484.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR3 cladogram for selection divergence analysis\nbetween terrestrial ungulates and cetaceans","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101469.phy"},{"tree_label":"TLR5 tree","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"TLR guide tree for selection analyses in PAML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101483.phy"}]}
