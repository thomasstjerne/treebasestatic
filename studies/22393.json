We report our findings in two\nundescribed Diaporhte species. Both were identified by their\nmorphological characteristics and by DNA sequence analyses. In Case 1,\nan 81-year-old male farmer who had pterygium surgery 7 years earlier\ndeveloped keratitis and the causal fungus was identified as a new\nspecies of Diaporthe, D. oculi. This species can be distinguished from\nthe closely related D. limonicola on Citrus limon (Rutaceae) by the ITS,\ntef1, and TUB (515/520 = 99.0% in ITS, 315/324 = 97.2% in tef1, and\n601/614 = 97.9% in TUB). The isolate from Case 2, a 68-year-old man with\na rose thorn injury, was also identified as a new Diaporthe species, D.\npseudooculi. Phylogenetically, D. pseudooculi is different from the\nclosely related D. podocarpi-macrophylli by the ITS, tef1, and TUB\n(525/531 = 98.9% in ITS, 314/333 = 94.3% in tef1, and 436/442 = 98.6% in\nTUB).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115522.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115523.phy"}]}
