Our analysis recovered\nHypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae as monophyletic with\nstrong statistical support, and Neoplecostominae as more closely related\nto Otothyrinae than to Hypoptopomatinae. Our time-calibrated phylogeny\nand ancestral-area estimations indicate an origin of Hypoptopomatinae,\nNeoplecostominae, and Otothyrinae during the Lower Eocene in the\nAtlantic Coastal Drainages, from which it is possible to infer several\ndispersal events to adjacent river basins during the Neogene. In\nconclusion we infer a strong influence of river capture in: (1) the\naccumulation of modern clade species-richness values; (2) the formation\nof the modern basin-wide species assemblages, and (3) the presence of\nmany low-diversity, early-branching lineages restricted to the Atlantic\nCoastal Drainages. We further infer the importance of headwater stream\ncapture and marine transgressions in shaping patterns in the\ndistributions of Hypoptopomatinae, Neoplecostominae and Otothyrinae\nthroughout South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81301.phy"}]}
