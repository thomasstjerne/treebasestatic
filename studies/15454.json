We conclude that\nthose proposed changes were based on 1) mtDNA gene tree anomalies, 2)\npreliminary analyses that do not fully capture the breadth of geographic\nvariation necessary to motivated taxonomic changes, and 3) changes in\nrank that are not motivated by non-monophyletic groups. Our\nrecommendation, for this and other similar cases, is that taxonomic\nchanges be made only when phylogenetic results that are statistically\nwell-supported and corroborated by multiple independent lines of genetic\nevidence indicate that non-monophyletic groups are currently recognized\nand need to be corrected. We hope that other members of the\nphylogenetics community will join us in proposing taxonomic changes only\nwhen the strongest phylogenetic data demands such changes, and in so\ndoing that we can move toward stable, phylogenetically informed\nclassifications of lasting value.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr70929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_70929.phy"}]}
