General distribution of the species, its\necological and morphological differences from H. crustosa (Xylodon\ncrustosus) are discussed. Bayesian reconstruction of phylogeny based on\nITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences demonstrated that\nboth H. crustosa and H. juniperi belong to a species complex, which\nrequires richer molecular sampling for separation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphodontia juniperi-crustosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79512.phy"}]}
