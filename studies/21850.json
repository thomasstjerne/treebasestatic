This is due to an overlap of\nmorphological characters in genera and lack of DNA sequence data to\ninfer phylogenetic relationships. The main objective of the present\npaper is to establish a novel genus, Muritestudina, based on a distinct\nmorphology and analyses of combined LSU, SSU, ITS, rpb2 and tef1\nsequence data. We also fill the gap in our current knowledge on the\nphylogenetic position of Testudinaceae. Based on a consideration of the\nmorphological characters of species representing existing genera of\nTestudinaceae, we herein introduce a new genus, Muritestudina with M.\nchiangraiensis as the type species. The new genus is characterized by\nglobose to subglobose, ostiolate ascomata, a peridium of brown to\ndark-brown cells of textura angularis, septate and cellular\npseudoparaphyses, cylindric-clavate asci with a distinct pedicel, and\nhyaline, ellipsoidal and muriform ascospores. The new genus differs from\nthe type and other genera in Testudinaceae in having hyaline, muriform\nascospores. Combined analyses of ribosomal and protein gene sequence\ndata confirm that our new taxon belongs in Testudinaceae and has a close\nrelationship with Neotestudina rosati","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108071.phy"}]}
