Species showing the trait\nexhibit early cessation of cambial activity in the central stele of the\nseedling followed by differentiation of a series of concentric layers of\ninter-connecting vascular strands, each layer derived from new cambial\nactivity in pericycle tissue outside the existing vasculature. The\nontogeny and mature structure of the anomalously thickened roots of\ncertain species is described and the findings compared with published\ndata for other genera of dicotyledons. A cladogram is presented to\nportray the phylogeny of the species of Daviesia included in the study,\nusing 36 morphological features and the parsimony method to derive\nminimum length Wagner-type trees from a matrix of taxa character states.\nEvolution of the character of anomalous root thickening is concluded to\nhave occurred early and possibly on two independent occasions during\nspeciation of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 30","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daviesia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3226.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 30+","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daviesia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3227.phy"}]}
