Morphology and a\nphylogenetic analysis of four loci from ribosomal (SSU, ITS, LSU) and\nmitochondrial (CO3) DNA, showed that the rust on P. falcataria differed\nfrom U. tepperianum. Uromycladium falcatarium sp. nov. is described to\naccommodate this taxon, which can be differentiated from other species\nof Uromycladium by teliospore wall morphology, host genus and DNA\nsequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90424","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90424.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90425","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90425.phy"}]}
