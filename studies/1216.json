Light micrographs of a new\ngermination pattern are added to discuss differences to other four\ngermination patterns of the powdery mildews. The rDNA sequences (28S and\n18S regions) of the fungi found on Phyllanthus spp. formed a distinct\nmonophyletic clade strongly supported by bootstrap (100%) in 18S+28S\ntrees, which indicates that the fungus is an isolated fungal group among\nthe Erysiphaceae in tribal level. Because we did not find teleomorphic\nstate of this fungus, a new subgenus Microidium of anamorphic genus\nOidium is proposed to accommodate this organism.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1866.phy"}]}
