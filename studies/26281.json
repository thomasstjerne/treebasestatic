The phylogenetic relationship of\nVanakripa species was sought among representative taxa from related\nfungal ordinal lineage, namely the Conioscyphales, Fuscosporellales,\nPleurotheciellales and Savoryellales, by comparing the sequences of\ntheir nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS barcode). Based on phylogenetic\nrelationship and morphological comparison, V. moniliformis comb. nov.\nand V. mucosa comb. nov. are proposed, which are transferred from\nParafuscosporella moniliformis and P. mucosa, respectively. Vanakripa\nellipsoidea is re-typified by designating its lectotype. New terminology\nis used to describe conidial shapes of Vanakripa species and a key to\nthe 13 accepted species is given.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123627.phy"},{"tree_label":"Vanakripa new Tre","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126545","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126545.phy"}]}
