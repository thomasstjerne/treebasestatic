A phylogenetic\nanalysis of the family and members of Alismatales was conducted to\nclarify the circumscription of Juncaginaceae and to understand\nintrafamilial relationships. For the first time, all genera associated\nwith the family in the past were analysed together. Two plastid (rbcL\nand matK) and one mitochondrial gene (atpA) were sequenced. The separate\nand combined analysis of the three markers showed that Juncaginaceae are\nnot monophyletic in their current circumscription. The family is\nre-circumscribed to exclude Maundia which is proposed to belong to a\nseparate family Maundiaceae. In the new classification Juncaginaceae\ncomprise three genera: Tetroncium, Cycnogeton, and Triglochin.\nTetroncium is weakly supported as sister to the rest of the family. The\nreinstated Cycnogeton (formerly included in Triglochin) is highly\nsupported as sister to Triglochin s.str. The enigmatic Lilaea is nested\nwithin Triglochin s.str. and highly supported as sister to the T.\nbulbosa complex. The results of the molecular analysis are discussed in\ncombination with morphological characters. A key to the genera of the\nfamily is presented, and six new combinations are proposed: Cycnogeton\nalcockiae, Cycnogeton dubium, Cycnogeton microtuberosum, Cycnogeton\nmultifructum, Cycnogeton rheophilum, and Triglochin scilloides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, rbcL matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6823.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6825.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, atpA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6842.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, rbcL matK atpA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6954.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alismatales, matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6798.phy"}]}
