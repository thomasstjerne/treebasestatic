Some groups of species have been\nproposed in the literature based on morphological similarities or\nphylogenetic analyses. The geniculata group was proposed to include the\nthree species C. geniculata, C. gravis and C. nigritarsis. However,\nother eleven species of Chinavia share somatic and genital\ncharacteristics with C. geniculata, C. gravis and C. nigritarsis, which\nallows hypothesizing the monophyly among these 14 species. In spite of\nthe recent contributions to aspects of biology, immature stages and\nspecies catalogs in Chinavia, the definition of monophyletic groups\nwithin the genus and the establishment of boundaries among its species\nare essential to understand its diversity and to test hypotheses on\nbiogeography and evolutionary biology. In this study we review the\ntaxonomy of the geniculata group, test its monophyly and propose a\nphylogenetic hypothesis to the group. We discuss the phylogenetic\nrelationships from a geographical perspective, and provide insights\nabout morphological evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chinavia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101577.phy"}]}
