A cladistic analysis comprising a data set of 40 morphological\ncharacters and 22 taxa, including the genera Elsiella, Serdia Stï¿½l,\nSimilliserdia Fortes & Grazia, Neotibilis Grazia & Barcellos,\nand Tibilis Stï¿½l, was performed. Elsiella plana is redescribed and\nillustrated. Maps are provided for Elsiella and Serdia with\nbiogeographical considerations for Serdia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51331.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51338.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 7","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51337.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 6","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51336.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 5","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51335.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 4","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51334.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51333.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elsiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51332.phy"}]}
