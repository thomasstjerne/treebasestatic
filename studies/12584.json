The new sequence of these regions\nwas aligned with 28 sequences obtained from GenBank, including four\nspecies of Davidiellaceae (Capnodiales) used as outgroup. This is the\nfirst study in trying to resolve the placement of the genus Anhellia\nwithin Myriangiales. The data show that Myriangiales are related group\nwith Dothideales. The genus Anhellia was highly supported in\nMyriangiaceae by phylogenetic analyzes. In addition, A. nectandrae sp.\nnov., collected on Nectandra rigida in a fragment of Atlantic forest in\nBrazil, is described, illustrated and a table with morphological\nfeatures to all known Anhellia species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anhellia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52108.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anhellia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52109.phy"}]}
