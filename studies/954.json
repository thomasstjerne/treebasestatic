Combined and separate analyses based on morphological\ndata and three chloroplast loci (the genes rbcL and the rps4, and the\ntrnL-trnF gene region) were carried out. Based on the combined analysis,\nthe Bartramiaceae appear to be a monophyletic group including Anacolia,\nBartramia, Breutelia, Conostomum, Fleischerobryum, Flowersia, Leiomela,\nNeosharpiella, Philonotis, and Plagiopus. The same result was obtained\nalso from the analyses of rbcL and morphological data. Catoscopium is\nexcluded from the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Genera of Bartramiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_874.phy"}]}
