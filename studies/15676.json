Their\ntaxonomic histories have also been intertwined, since they have often\nbeen combined, as one family (e.g., Pedaliaceae). The temperate Asian\naquatic plant Trapella was also assigned to Pedaliaceae, based on fruits\nwith similar dispersal traits. With expanded sampling of both families,\nincluding Trapella, and data from ndhF, trnLF, and ETS sequences, this\nstudy confirms that the two families are distinct lineages, identifies a\nnew placement for Trapella in tribe Gratioleae (Plantaginaceae s.l.),\nand shows that the two families exhibit a combination of shared floral\nmorphology due to their proximity in Lamiales, and convergent functional\nmorphology for dispersal. The phylogeny finds the three tribes of\nPedaliaceae to be monophyletic, but shows that Sesamum is not\nmonophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trapella placement ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74371.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedaliaceae/Martyniaceae chloroplast tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_74369.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedaliaceae ETS-ML with Bootstrap corrected","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74372.phy"}]}
