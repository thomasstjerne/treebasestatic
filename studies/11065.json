Therefore, we here propose the\nfollowing combinations: Mattirolomyces spinosus comb. nov. (şTerfezia\nspinosa), Stouffera longii gen. & comb. nov. (ş Terfezia longii) and\nTemperantia tiffanyae gen. & comb. nov. (ş Mattirolomyces\ntiffanyae). In addition, we describe a new species, Mattirolomyces\nmexicanus spec. nov. All species belong to the Pezizaceae. Based on\nthese results Terfezia is not known from North America, Mattirolomyces\nis represented by two species, and two new monotypic genera are\npresent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr26183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26183.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr26182","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_26182.phy"}]}
