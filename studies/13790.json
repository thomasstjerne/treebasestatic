The former species is\ncharacterized by obclavate to fusiform, 4- to 7-septate, dark brown\nconidia, with a mucous tunica at the apex; sometimes with an unusual\noblong to bacilliform, hyaline, phialidic conidial synanamorph arising\nfrom the apical cell. Analysis of D1/D2 region rDNA sequences revealed\nthat this fungus is related to members of the family\nKirschsteiniotheliaceae of the Dothideomycetes. Solicorynespora\nbiseptata is distinguished by obclavate, 2-septate, brown, but pale\nbrown at the apex, smooth conidia. This latter fungus did not grow in\nculture. A key to species of Solicorynespora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solicorynespora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102084.phy"}]}
