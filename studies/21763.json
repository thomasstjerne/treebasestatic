Fifteen isolates were selected by their morphological\nappearance on culture medium. They were evaluated for biomass and PUFAs\nproduction by using six different culture medium and Gas\nchromatographyÂ–mass spectrometry, respectively. The highest yields were\nobtained from three strains (TC4-TSU, TC6-TSU and TC9-TSU) of\nAurantiochytrium limacinum. Strain TC9-TSU could utilize 6% D-glucose as\ncarbon source and 1% yeast extract as nitrogen source and showed the\nhighest biomass at 0.5 g dry cell weight/L. On the other hand, this\nstrain gave the highest PUFAs production. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA;\n22:6n3) and eicosapentaenic acid (EPA; 20:5n3) were the major components\nof the total fatty acid content, comprising about 40% and 25%,\nrespectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107718","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107718.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107719","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107719.phy"}]}
