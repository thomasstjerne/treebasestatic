We examined ichthyoplankton from tributaries and reservoirs\nalong the middle stretch of the Paranapanema River, one of the areas\nmost impacted by hydroelectric projects in the Neotropics. Matching DNA\nsequences of the COI gene (628-648 bp) allowed us to identify 99.25% of\n536 samples of eggs (293) and larvae (243) subjected to BOLD-IDS\nsimilarity analysis with a species-level threshold of 1.3%. The results\nrevealed 37 species in 27 genera, 15 families and four orders, some\n23.8% of documented fish species in the Paranapanema River. Molecular\nidentification meant that we could include data from egg samples that\naccounted for about 30% of the species richness observed. The results in\nthis study confirm the efficacy of DNA barcoding in identifying\nNeotropical ichthyoplankton and show how the data produced provide\nvaluable information for preparing plans for conserving and managing\ninland waters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"1628","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Freshwater ichthyoplankton COI-5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86155.phy"}]}
