Morphologically, this\nnew species is characterized by resupinate to effused-reflexed\nbasidiomata with cream to brown pore surface, a dimitic hyphal system\nand basidiospores that are cylindrical to subcylindrical, in frontal\nview with an obovoid aspect, and in side-view present a sigmoid ventral\nside. Molecular phylogeny inferred from nrITS and nrLSU sequence data\nconfirmed that this species belongs to the Antrodia s. s. clade, closely\nrelated to European and North American species, A. serpens and A.\nheteromorpha. Its relationships within Antrodia s.s. as well as\nbiological and morphological characters of Antrodia s.s. are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90524","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_90524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogram of Antrodia s.s. recovered from ITS (ITS1,\n5.8S, ITS2) and nucLSU regions, inferred by Maximum likelihoodanalysis\n(log likelihood -3715.940706).","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_90525.phy"}]}
