Sixteen\npotentially related taxa classified within Boerhavia, Commicarpus,\nCyphomeris, Nyctaginia and Okenia were used as outgroup to test the\nmonophyly and phylogenetic position of Anulocaulis; Mirabilis\nglabrifolia was used to root the tree. Forty-one characters were\nincluded in the matrix, which was analyzed using the parsimony\ncriterion. Our results are in partial agreement with previous studies\nusing molecular data. Here, the monophyly of Anulocaulis is\ncorroborated, but the sister group remains ambiguous depending on\nwhether the multistate characters are treated as additive or\nnon-additive. In the first case, Anulocaulis is sister to\nNyctaginia-Okenia, while in the second it is sister to Boerhavia\nanisophylla. The morphological characters which have been used in the\ntraditional taxonomy and classification of the genus are analyzed and\ndiscussed under a phylogenetic context. Species recognition,\ninfraspecific taxa and infrageneric classification for Anulocaulis are\ndiscussed. A taxonomic synopsis for this xerophytic genus including keys\nand descriptions based on our cladistic results is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 04","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7856.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 02","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7854.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 08","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7860.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 07","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7859.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 06","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7858.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 03","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7855.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 05","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7857.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 10","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7862.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 09","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7861.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 01","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Anulocaulis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7853.phy"},{"tree_label":"t8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7253.phy"},{"tree_label":"t9","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7254","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7254.phy"},{"tree_label":"t10","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7255","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7255.phy"},{"tree_label":"t6","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7251.phy"},{"tree_label":"t7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7252","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7252.phy"},{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7246.phy"},{"tree_label":"t2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7247.phy"},{"tree_label":"t3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7248.phy"},{"tree_label":"t5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7250.phy"},{"tree_label":"t4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7249.phy"}]}
