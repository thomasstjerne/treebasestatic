Graphis koratensis Pitakpong,\nKraichak, L端cking sp. nov. is characterized by lirelline ascocarps,\nwhitish- grey or grey- green, pruina along the slit, transversely\nascospores and norstictic acid. Our phylogenetic analysis strongly\nsupported the distinct position of this new species with the genus. Six\nnew records from Thailand included G. cincta (Pers.) Aptroot, G.\njejuensis K. H. Moon, M.

With these new records, we provide a key of all of\nthe 57 currently known species from Thailand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Graphis mtSSU and nuLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88391.phy"}]}
