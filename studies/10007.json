It is revealed that at\nleast four species [F. rossica, Flammulina sp. (HKAS 51191), F.\nvelutipes and F. yunnanensis] occur in China. Flammulina yunnanensis is\ndescribed as new based on morphological and molecular data. F. rossica,\na new record to China, is confirmed to have a Holarctic distribution.\nFlammulina sp. has a hymeniform suprapellis but is phylogenetically\nclose to F. velutipes. Analyses of the ITS/5.8S rDNA sequences of\nFlammulina species suggest that collections of F. velutipes from China\nare more closely related to a Canadian population rather than to those\nof Europe and the USA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flammulina species from China","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6530.phy"}]}
