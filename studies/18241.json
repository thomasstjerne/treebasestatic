Here, we report\nthe discovery and detailed characterization of early-stage adaptive\ndivergence of two cichlid fish ecomorphs in a small (700m diameter)\nisolated crater lake in Tanzania. The ecomorphs differ in depth\npreference, male breeding color, body shape, diet and trophic\nmorphology. With whole genome sequences of 145 fish, we identify 98\nclearly demarcated genomic ‘islands’ of high differentiation and\ndemonstrate association of genotypes across these islands to divergent\nmate preferences. The islands contain candidate adaptive genes enriched\nfor functions in sensory perception (including rhodopsin and other\ntwilight vision associated genes), hormone signaling and morphogenesis.\nOur study suggests mechanisms and genomic regions that may play a role\nin the closely related mega-radiation of Lake Malawi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90456","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90456.phy"}]}
