Based on morphology and inferred phylogeny from DNA sequences of\ntwo loci, namely the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the\nlarge subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU), several species\nbelonging to chalara-like genera and lachnoid fungi were recognized.\nEighteen fungal isolates, collected from five host species, representing\n10 different localities were studied. Three novel genera (Lachnopsis,\nScolecolachnum and Zymochalara), and six novel species (Bloxamia\ncyatheicola, Lachnopsis catarinensis, Lachnopsis dicksoniae,\nScolecolachnum pteridii, Zymochalara lygodii and Zymochalara cyatheae)\nare introduced. Furthermore, two new combinations (Erioscyphella\neuterpes and Erioscyphella lushanensis) are proposed. Two novel taxa\n(Lachnopsis catarinensis and Lachnopsis dicksoniae) may be included in\nthe list of potentially endangered fungal species in Brazil, if proven\nto be restricted to their tree-fern host  Dicksonia sellowiana  which is\nincluded in the official list of endangered plant species in\nBrazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chalara its","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachnoid ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98242.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachnoid LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98243.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chalara LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98241.phy"}]}
