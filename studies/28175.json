Among them, 202 strains represent 38 known species,\nwhereas 42 strains represent 21 novel species based on the sequence\nanalyses of the rDNA genes (18S rDNA, ITS regions, 26S rDNA D1/D2\ndomain) and three protein genes (RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1). In this study\nseveral novelties, one order, one family, four genera and 21 species are\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130991","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130991.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"140","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130840.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130842","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130842.phy"}]}
