In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene\nbecoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (MT) as a\nmechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here we carried out the first\ncomprehensive study of a candidate MT-linked oogamy gene, MAT3/RB,\nacross the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of\nanisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male-female divergence of\nMAT3 that characterizes the Volvox carteri lineage. The data demonstrate\nvery little sex-linked sequence divergence of MAT3 between the two sexes\nin other volvocine groups, though linkage between MAT3 and the mating\nlocus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants\nother than or in addition to MAT3 in the evolution of anisogamy in\nvolvocine algae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of MAT3 proteins from the colonial Volvocales\nand Chlamydomonas","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59782.phy"}]}
