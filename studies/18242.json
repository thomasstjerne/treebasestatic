Results\nWe investigated 104 SBP-box genes from moss, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice,\nand maize. These genes are divided into group I and II, and the latter\nis further divided into two subgroups (subgroup II-1 and II-2) based on\nphylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, subgroup II-1 genes have similar\nsequence and structural features to group I genes, whereas subgroup II-2\ngenes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high\ncopy numbers and the presence of miR156/miR529 regulation. Further\nanalyses indicate that subgroup II-1 genes are constrained by stronger\npurifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than II-2\ngenes, just as group I genes do when compared to II genes. Among\nsubgroup II-2 genes, miR156 targets evolve more rapidly than miR529\ntargets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection. These\nresults suggest that group I and subgroup II-1 genes under strong\nselective constraint are conserved. By contrast, subgroup II-2 genes\nevolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through\ngene copy duplications and changes in miR156/529 regulation, which might\ncontribute to morphological diversifications of land plants. Conclusions\nOur results indicate that different evolutionary rates and selection\nstrengths lead to differing evolutionary patterns in SBP-box genes in\nland plants, providing a guide for future functional diversity analyses\nof these genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Land Plant - SBP-box protein sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90476.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Land Plant - SBP-box protein sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90475.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Land Plant - SBP-box protein sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90474.phy"}]}
