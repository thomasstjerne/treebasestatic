Twenty one species and subspecies from three\ncontinents were examined. Sequencing of a 677 region of a 780 bp\namplicon from 41 individuals and from 17 sequences obtained from GenBank\nrevealed 221 polymorphic sites within the genus. Tajima-Nei distances\nfrom species ranged from 0.9 to 12.7%, and parsimony and maximum\nlikelihood analysis revealed several clades within the genus.\nReticulitermes flavipes formed a distinct clade along with R.\nsantonensis. European R. lucifugus formed a distinct clade with R.\nbanyulensis. Turkish R. lucifugus were distinct relative to European R.\nlucifugus, and along with R. clypeatus from Israel formed a sister group\nwith R. balkanensis from Greece. This study provides support for the\nseparation of Turkish R. lucifugus from European members of the species.\nThis mtDNA marker was also able to identify several Reticulitermes\nspecimens from Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, and South Korea to\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MP","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5728.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Reticulitermes ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5729.phy"}]}
