The genus is characterized by annual to perennial,\nresupinate, effused-reflexed to distinctly pileate or stipitate\nbasidiomata which are soft, ceraceous, corky or leathery when fresh,\nbecoming fragile, resinous, hard corky to woody hard when dry; fresh\npores become bloody red, brownish or unchanged when bruised; a monomitic\nhyphal structure, thin- to thick-walled generative hyphae with simple\nsepta, hyphoid cystidia present in most species, hyaline, thin-walled,\nellipsoid, ovoid, subglobose to globose basidiospores and causing a\nwhite rot. The studied specimens are mainly from Asia, Europe, and North\nand Central America. Phylogenies on species of the genus are\nreconstructed with multiple loci DNA sequences including the internal\ntranscribed spacer regions (ITS), the large subunit (nLSU) and the small\nsubunit (nSSU) of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene, the small subunit of\nmitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-α\ngene (TEF1) and the second subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2). The\nresults demonstrate that Physisporinus is monophyletic and belongs to\nMeripilaceae in the residual polyporoid clade. One new genus,\nFuscorigidoporus, is established with two new species, F. costaricanus,\nF. persicinus, and one combination F. hypobrunneus. 15 new species in\nPhysisporinus are described and illustrated, and Meripilus giganteus is\nproposed to combine into Physisporinus. An identification key to\naccepted species of Physisporinus is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"192","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135872","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135872.phy"}]}
