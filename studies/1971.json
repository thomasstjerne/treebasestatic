The main aims of this study were to\ninfer the evolutionary relationships and assess phylogeographic patterns\namong the six species of Chionohebe, determine the origin of the two\nspecies with trans-Tasman distributions, and test species delimitations\nand specimen identifications based on morphology. Analyses of AFLP data\nrecovered five major lineages within Chionohebe, some of which\ncorresponded to species and varieties as currently circumscribed.\nAlthough the cushion chionohebes were strongly supported as\nmonophyletic, the sole non-cushion species, C. densifolia, was sister to\nParahebe trifida, and thus the AFLP data do not support a monophyletic\nChionohebe as usually circumscribed. Strong north/south and west/east\nphylogeographic patterns were found among and within the main AFLP\nlineages in New Zealand. Analyses of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) revealed\neight haplotypes in Chionohebe, but these did not correspond to current\ntaxonomy or geography due to widespread interspecific haplotype sharing.\nBased on both AFLP and cpDNA results, the two trans-Tasman species are\nshown to have originated in New Zealand and dispersed to Australia\nindependently.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chionohebe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_357.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chionohebe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2945.phy"}]}
