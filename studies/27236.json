Based\non mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU), nuclear large subunit (nucLSU)\nof rDNA and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), this study\nfurther resolved the Neoconidiobolus genus into three clades, with three\nnew taxa being added. These new taxa formed a monophyletic clade and\nshare a synapomorph: Their primary conidia are smaller than any species\nin the other two clades. They are N. kunyushanensis B.
