The fungus is generically distinct in the\nbrown, short-stalked, bulbose or flask-shaped conidiogenous cells with a\nsolitary terminal pore rimmed with a flared collarette, producing large,\ndematiaceous, versicolored, multi-euseptate, tetrahedral or obpyramidal\nstauroconidia which bear hyaline filiform appendages at the end of the\nconidial arms. The new fungus is compared with a number of similar\nhyphomycetes. Phylogenetic analysis using the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2\n(ITS barcode) supports the placement of this new fungus in the\nChaetosphaeriaceae. The various anamorphic forms of chaetosphariaceous\nanamorphs are briefly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Phaeonawawia Tree","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125588","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125588.phy"},{"tree_label":"Phaeo Fam Tree","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125593.phy"}]}
