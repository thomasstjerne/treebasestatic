Herein, we reconstruct the\nphylogenetic relationships of the group using both previously published\nand new 18S and CO1 gene sequences. We present some taxonomic revisions\nof Microstomidae and further describe 8 new species of Microstomum based\non both molecular and morphological evidence. Finally, we briefly review\nthe morphological taxonomy of each species and provide a key to aid in\nfuture research and identification that is not dependent on reproductive\nmorphology. Our goal is to clarify the taxonomy and facilitate future\nresearch into an otherwise very understudied group of tiny (but\nimportant) flatworms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"334","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116733","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116733.phy"}]}
