C. chilensis, phylogenetically\ndistinct from other species in the genus, is also characterized\nmorphologically by its ascoma with emerald green stalk and pale orange\nbrown head, budding paraphyses and 5-6-septate ascospores. Based on the\nphylogenetic analysis, the Australasian species Vibrissea albofusca is\nrecombined in Chlorovibrissea, despite it lacking the distinctive green\npigmentation of other species in this genus. In addition, the genus\nVibrissea in a strict phylogenetic sense is confirmed from the Southern\nHemisphere for the first time; Vibrissea truncorum is reported from\nChile and V. flavovirens from New Zealand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorovibrissea MrB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75519.phy"}]}
