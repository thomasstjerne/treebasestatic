Spores of G.perpusillum were formed in\nhypogeous aggregates and occasionally inside roots. They are 38 globose\nto subglobose, (10-)24(-30) ìm diam, rarely egg-shaped, oblong to\nirregular, 18-25 x 25-63 ìm. Their wall consists of two permanent\nlayers: a finely laminate, semiflexible to rigid outer layer and a\nflexible to semiflexible inner layer. The inner layer becomes plastic\nand frequently highly contracts in spores vigorously crushed in\nPVLG-based mountants and stains reddish white to grayish red in Melzer\u001as\nreagent. Glomus perpusillum was originally associated with roots of\nAmmophila arenaria colonizing sandy dunes of the Mediterranean Sea\nadjacent to Calambrone (Italy) and this is the only site of its\noccurrence known to date. In one-species cultures with Plantago\nlanceolata as the host plant, G. perpusillum formed 46\nvesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae. Phylogenetic analyses of partial SSU\nsequences of nrDNA placed the species into the Glomus group A with no\naffinity to its subgroups. The sequences of G. perpusillum unambiguously\nseparated from the sequences of described Glomus species and formed a\ndistinct clade among with in planta arbuscular fungal sequences from\nAlpine plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomus, GrA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5322.phy"}]}
