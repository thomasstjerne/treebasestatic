Based on morphological and\nphylogenetic investigations, four new species in three different genera,\nClitocella, Clitopilus and Rhodocybe, one new variety of a Rhodocybe\npreviously known only from other islands in the Caribbean, and first\nreports of Clitopilus prunulus, Rhodocybe mellea and R. roseiavellanea\nare described and illustrated from the island of Hispaniola. Three\nprotein coding genes, rpb2, tef1, and atp6, were used to compare taxa\nand make phylogenetic inferences about novel species and varieties. This\ncontribution is a first step in documenting the macrofungal biodiversity\nof the Entolomataceae for the Dominican Republic and the island of\nHispaniola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodocybe Clitopilus clade 3 gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119098.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clitopilus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119099.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodocybe mellea ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119097.phy"}]}
