Until recently, the 96 species in the family were classified in\na single genus, Casuarina s.l. A recent morphological revision of the\nfamily resulted in the splitting of Casuarina s.l. into four genera -\nAllocasuarina, Casuarina s.s., Ceuthostoma and Gymnostoma. This study\nuses matK sequence data from 78 species of Casuarinaceae and eight\npotential outgroup taxa to examine the phylogenetic structure within the\nCasuarinaceae. The study demonstrates the monophyly of the four genera\nand examines the sister group relationships within the family; it tests\nthe validity of the infra-generic subdivision of Allocasuarina; it\ndiscovers geography-based infra-generic subdivisions within Gymnostoma\nand Casuarina; and, finally, provides a molecular framework on which to\ntrace the evolution of xeromorphy in the Casuarinaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Casuarinaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_876.phy"}]}
