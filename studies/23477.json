Taxonomy of these pathogens is\ndifficult due to their uninformative descriptions and similar asexual\nmorphology. Based on molecular phylogenies, many species of this group\nwere placed in various families of Diaporthales. In this study, eight\nspecies of melanconis like fungi were isolated from Betula albosinensis,\nB. platyphylla (Betulaceae), Cornus controversa (Cornaceae), Corylus\nmandshurica (Betulaceae) and Juglans regia (Juglandaceae) in China.\nThese species were phylogenetically placed in three families of\nDiaporhthales, i.e. Juglanconis juglandina, J. oblonga\n(Juglanconidaceae), Melanconiella betulicola sp. nov., M. corylina sp.\nnov. (Melanconiellaceae), Melanconis betulae, Ms. itoana,\nMs. stilbostoma (Melanconidaceae), and one new genus, Sheathospora\n(Melanconiellaceae). Sheathospora is proposed to accommodate\nMelanconiella cornuta with conical and discrete pycnidia with aseptate,\nhyaline, cylindrical to ellipsoidal conidia with distinct hyaline sheath\non branches of Cornus controversa. Combined analyses of ITS, LSU, CAL,\nRPB2 and TEF1-α sequence data were used to construct the molecular\nphylogeny. Additionally, we provided separate phylogenetic trees for\nthree families (Juglanconidaceae, Melanconidaceae and Melanconiellaceae)\nto show the species distribution of melanconis-like fungi in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"211","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114641.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanconis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114640.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Juglanconis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114643.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanconiellaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114642.phy"}]}
