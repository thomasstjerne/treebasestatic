Since that time a further ve species have been ascribed\nto the genus and one similar species within the genus Hebeloma. In\ntotal, we have studied seventeen collections that have been assigned to\nthese seven species of Hebelomina. We provide a synopsis of the\navailable knowledge on Hebelomina species and Hebelomina-like\ncollections and their taxonomic placement. Methods  Hebelomina-like\ncollections and type collections of Hebelomina species were examined\nmorphologically and molecularly. Ribosomal RNA sequence data were used\nto clarify the taxonomic placement of species and collections. Key\nresults  Hebelomina is shown to be polyphyletic and members belong to\nfour di erent genera (Gymnopilus, Hebeloma, Tubaria and incertae sedis),\nall members of di erent families and clades. All but one of the species\nare pigment-deviant forms of normally brown-spored taxa. The type of the\ngenus had been transferred to Hebeloma, and Vesterholt and co-workers\nproposed that Hebelomina be given status as a subsection of Hebeloma. In\nthe meantime, Hebelomina-like Hebeloma, belonging to seven di erent\nspecies in three di erent sections, have been found. We conclude that\nHebelomina should be abandoned as a supraspeci c taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B ML","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma sect.
