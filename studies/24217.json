Fruit\nbats presumably participated in woodland expansions during wet periods\nthrough their roles in pollination and seed dispersal. We hypothesized\nthat phylogeographic patterns of Rousettus on continental Africa and\nadjacent islands should show a signature of pluvial‐drought cycles,\ninvolving demographic expansions and contractions. Moreover, as these\nbats are highly mobile, we aim to understand the role of insular effects\nand potential ecotypic variation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rousettus aegyptiacus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129099.phy"}]}
