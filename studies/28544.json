The fungus is distinguished by larger smooth,\nhyaline, cylindrical conidia with one or three middle contracted\nseptate. Phylogenetic position of Querciphoma sophoracola is explored\nbased on a multilocus sequence analysis of the ITS, LSU, small subunit\n18S nrDNA (SSU), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1)\nregions. The sexual stage of Querciphoma which is charactered of smaller\nascomata, multi-transversely septate and biseriate ascospore is reported\nfirstly.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132214","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132214.phy"}]}
