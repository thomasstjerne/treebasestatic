{"Authors":" Dimitrios Floudas, David S Hibbett","Year":" 2015","Title":" Revisiting the taxonomy of Phanerochaete (Polyporales,\nBasidiomycota) using a four gene dataset and extensive ITS sampling","Journal":" Fungal Biology","Volume":" 46","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Phanerochaete, phlebioid clade, Polyporales, phylogeny,\ntaxonomy, multi-marker analyses","DOI":" 10.1016/j.funbio.2015.04.003","Abstract":" We amplified RPB1, RPB2 and the ITS and LSU ribosomal\ngenes from species mostly in the phlebioid clade, focusing heavily in\nphanerochaetoid taxa. We performed Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses for different combinations of datasets. Our results provide a\nstrongly supported phylogenetic picture of the phlebioid clade,\nrepresenting 89 species in the four genes analyses, of which 49\nrepresent phanerochaetoid taxa. Phanerochaete sensu lato is polyphyletic\nand distributed across nine lineages in the phlebioid clade. Six of\nthese lineages are associated to already described genera, while we\ndescribe the new genus Phaeophlebiopsis to accommodate Phlebiopsis-like\nspecies in one of the remaining lineages. We also propose three\ntaxonomic transfers and describe eight new species, with four of those\nspecies currently placed in Phanerochaete sanguinea or Phanerochaete\nvelutina. Finally, the placement of Leptoporus mollis along with other\npotential brown-rot species in the phlebioid clade suggests that, in\naddition to the Antrodia clade, brown-rot may have evolved more than\nonce in Polyporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 5 Phebia clade","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebia clade ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3 MrBayes","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RBP2 MrBayes tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86025.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 a & b MrBayes","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"4 genes MrBayes tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86032.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1 a & b ML","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"4 genes ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86031.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3 ML","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPB2 ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S1 Mr Bayes","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS+LSU MrBayes tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86028.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S1 ML","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS+LSU ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S4 MrBayes tree","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3 genes concatenated dataset MrBayes analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86030.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S4 ML tree","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"3 genes concatenated dataset ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86029.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 Phlebiopsis clade","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiopsis clade ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86033.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 Byssomerulius","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Byssomerulius clade ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 MrBayes","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPB1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2 ML","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RPB1 tree ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85981.phy"},{"tree_label":"Sup Fig. 5a","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceriporia-Meruliopsis ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85976.phy"},{"tree_label":"Sup Fig. 5b","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Efibula and related taxa ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2 a,b,c Phanerochaete sensu stricto","ntax":"195","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete sensu stricto ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86037.phy"}]}
