The\nphylogenetic relationships of wasps pollinating functionally dioecious\nFicus were inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene sequences\n(mtDNA) and morphology. Separate and combined analyses indicated that\nthe pollinators of functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic.\nHowever, pollinator relationships were generally congruent with host\nphylogeny and support a revised classication of Ficus. Ancestral changes\nin pollinator ovipositor length also correlated with changes in breeding\nsystems. In particular, the relative elongation of the ovipositor was\nassociated with the repeated loss of functionally dioecious pollination.\nThe concerted evolution of interacting morphologies may bias estimates\nof phylogeny based on female head characters, but homoplasy is not so\nstrong in other morphological traits. The lesser phylogenetic utility of\nmorphology than of mtDNA is not due to rampant convergence in morphology\nbut rather to the greater number of potentially informative characters\nin DNA sequence data; patterns of nucleotide substitution also limit the\nutility of mtDNA findings. Nonetheless, inferring the ancestral\nassociations of pollinators fromthe best-supported phylogeny provided\nstrong evidence of host conservatism in this highly specialized\nmutualism.
