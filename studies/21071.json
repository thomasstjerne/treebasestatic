Results: In this study, we identified 21, 20, and 38 WOX genes\nin Gossypium arboreum (2n = 26, A2), G. raimondii (2n = 26, D5), and G.\nhirsutum (2n = 4x = 52, (AD)t), respectively. Sequence logos showed that\nhomeobox domains were significantly conserved among the WOX genes in\ncotton, Arabidopsis, and rice. A total of 168 genes from three typical\nmonocots and six dicots were naturally divided into three clades, which\nwere further classified into nine sub-clades. A good collinearity was\nobserved in the synteny analysis of the orthologs from At and Dt (t\nrepresents tetraploid) sub-genomes. Whole genome duplication (WGD) and\nsegmental duplication within At and Dt sub-genomes played significant\nroles in the expansion of WOX genes, and segmental duplication mainly\ngenerated the WUS clade. Copia and Gypsy were the two major types of\ntransposable elements distributed upstream or downstream of WOX genes.\nFurthermore, through comparison, we found that the exon/intron pattern\nwas highly conserved between Arabidopsis and cotton, and the homeobox\ndomain loci were also conserved between them. In addition, the\nexpression pattern in different tissues indicated that the duplicated\ngenes in cotton might have acquired new functions as a result of\nsub-functionalization or neo-functionalization. The expression pattern\nof WOX genes under different stress treatments showed that the different\ngenes were induced by different stresses. Conclusion: In present work,\nWOX genes, classified into three clades, were identified in the upland\ncotton genome. Whole genome and segmental duplication were determined to\nbe the two major impetuses for the expansion of gene numbers during the\nevolution. Moreover, the expression patterns suggested that the\nduplicated genes might have experienced a functional divergence.\nTogether, these results shed light on the evolution of the WOX gene\nfamily, and would be helpful in future research.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"WOX genes in upland cotton Figure2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105049.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"WOX genes in upland cotton Figure2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Add file 3","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"WOX genes in upland cotton Figure2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105048.phy"}]}
