Controlled greenhouse crosses indicated that the two\ncytotypes are largely reproductively isolated. Fourteen diploid and 11\ntetraploid populations were analyzed electrophoretically. Individual\ntetraploid plants expressed up to four alleles per isozyme locus, and\ntetraploid populations had significantly higher levels of heterozygosity\nthan diploids. Mean observed heterozygosity was 0.159 for tetraploid\npopulations and 0.058 for diploid populations. The patterns of allelic\ndistribution betwecn cytotypes suggested multiple origins of\nautotetraploids. This hypothesis was supported by restriction-site\nanalysis of chloroplast-DNA (cpDNA) variation which indicated that there\nhad been at least three independent origins of tetraploids.\nElectrophoretic data, in conjunction with a cpDNA-based phylogeny and\ngeographic distribution of populations, suggest that autopolyploid\npopulations evolved several times as migration of diploids occurred down\nriver systems. This study further supports the contention that\nautopolyploidy can be a common and successful speciation process in some\ngroups of plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heuchera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4281.phy"}]}
