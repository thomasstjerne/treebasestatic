Mycelia grew at the rate of\n10.6 mm/d at 20 C on PDA. Sclerotia were spherical to elliptical\n(0.42.5× 0.31.8 mm). Conidia formed on diseased tissue were hyaline to\npale brown, long ovoid and unicellular. Size of conidia was 15.124.5 ×\n8.813.4μm. Conidiophores were 5261064×1215μm. Phylogenetic analyses\nbased on G3PDH, RPB2, and HSP60 sequence data supported a placement of\nrepresentative three isolates as a new species in Botrytis. Based on\nmorphological and phylogenetic characteristics, the causal agent of gray\nmold on P. polyphylla was described as Botrytis polyphyllae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110020","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110020.phy"}]}
