Previous\nmolecular phylogenetic studies, although with limited taxon sampling,\nhave suggested that it is polyphyletic and forms a complex with ten\nother eastern Asian genera of Tussilagininae, i.e. the\nLigulariaCremanthodium Parasenecio (LCP) complex. Here we sample\nParasenecio and its relatives in the LCP complex densely and generate\ntwo phylogenetic hypotheses for the genus using four plastid DNA\n(trnCGCA-petN, trnGUCC-trnTGGU-psbD, trnTUGUtrnLUAA and rpl32-ndhF) and\ntwo nuclear ribosomal (nr)DNA [internal and external transcribed spacer\n(ITS and ETS)] regions, respectively. Analyses of the plastid DNA data\nproduce a robust generic-level phylogenetic tree for Parasenecio and\nclearly demonstrate the polyphyletic pattern of the genus. Most notably,\ntwo sections of Parasenecio, P. section Delphiniifolii s.s. and P.\nsection Taimingasa, are shown to be distantly related to core\nParasenecio, being sister to Miricacalia and Syneilesis, respectively,\nwith strong support. The small genus Sinacalia is also revealed to be\npolyphyletic, with S. caroli nested in core Parasenecio, and S.\ntangutica and S. davidii forming a clade sister to the core\nParasenecioS. caroli clade. The nrDNA tree is, however, relatively\npoorly resolved, only confirming the sister relationship between P.\nsection Delphiniifolii s.s. and Miricacalia. Sinacalia s.s. is resolved\nas being deeply nested in core Parasenecio with nrDNA data, which is the\nonly significant incongruence with the plastid DNA hypothesis relevant\nto the generic circumscription of Parasenecio. Statistical topology\n(approximately unbiased and Swofford OlsenWaddellHillis) tests suggest\nthat, except for the position of Sinacalia s.s., the generic-level\nrelationships of Parasenecio inferred from the plastid DNA data are not\nincongruent with those from the nrDNA data and, on the basis of current\nsequence data, the inferred molecular phylogenetic relationships should\nbe preferred over the current classification. Based on these results and\nevidence from morphology and karyology, we propose a new circumscription\nof Parasenecio, involving transferring S. caroli to Parasenecio as P.\ncaroli comb. nov. and segregating P. section Delphiniifolii s.s. and P.\nsection Taimingasa as the new genera Japonicalia gen. nov. and\nTaimingasa gen. nov., respectively. Sinacalia s.s., with significant\nincongruence between the plastid DNA and nrDNA trees, is tentatively\nretained as an independent genus pending future studies. A revised key\nto Parasenecio and its close relatives is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105299.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105300.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105301.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105302.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105303.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105304.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105305","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105305.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105306.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105307","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105307.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105308","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105308.phy"}]}
