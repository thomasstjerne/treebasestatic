This species is similar to\nE. pisiformis in its yellowish sporocarps and zygosporangia on the equal\nempty gametangia. Endogone corticioides was clearly distinguished from\nE. pisiformis based on its resupinate sporocarp, the presence of hyphal\npeg-like structures on the peridium, and abundant thick-walled hyphae in\nthe gleba. Phylogenetic analysis of the small and large subunit nuclear\nribosomal RNA and the elongation factor-1a genes sug- gested that E.\ncorticioides is closely related to E. pisiformis. Limited vegetative\ngrowth from the surface-sterilized sporocarps on agar media was\nshown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endogone 18S+28S+EF1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94667.phy"}]}
