Based on sequences of ITS-1, 5.8S,\nand ITS-2 regions of the rDNA complex and translation-elongation factor\n(EF-1α), T. atroviride and H. atroviridis form a well-supported clade\nwithin Trichoderma sect. Trichoderma. The conserved anamorphic phenotype\nof T. atroviride, observed for both conidial and ascospore derived\ncultures, was only found within that clade. In contrast, the teleomorph\nphenotype of H. atroviridis was morphologically indistinguishable from\nH. rufa, the teleomorph of T. viride. This Hypocrea phenotype may,\ntherefore, be considered to be plesiomorphic within Trichoderma sect.\nTrichoderma, suggesting that genes controlling the expression of the\nteleomorph and anamorph evolve at different rates and that the genes\ncontrolling expression of the teleomorph are more conserved than are\nthose controlling the expression of the anamorph.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4032.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4033.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4034.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1d","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea Trichoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4035.phy"}]}
