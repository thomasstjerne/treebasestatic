Molecular phylogenetic, morphological,\nfield, and herbarium research concerning the delimitation of Spiranthes\nodorata necessitates the reinstatement and redescription of Spiranthes\ntriloba, a name alternately synonymized under Spiranthes cernua and\nSpiranthes odorata for more than a century. While lost under synonymy,\nplants matching the morphology of Spiranthes triloba were ambiguously\ndescribed as Spiranthes ×itchetuckneensis and Spiranthes ×folsomii.\nAlthough the species has a descriptive specific epithet, the labellum of\nthe holotype is decidedly not tri-lobed; Spiranthes triloba is\nredescribed and emended here so as to reflect its actual morphology.\nSpiranthes triloba is restricted to frequently burned calcareous\nprairies and flatwoods of Florida and likely warrants protection at the\nstate level. A key is provided to distinguish this species from other\nSpiranthes found in Florida, and a lectotype is designated for S.\n×folsomii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95566","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95566.phy"}]}
