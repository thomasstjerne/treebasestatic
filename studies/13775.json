Previous studies predominantly\nconcerned the diversity of marine fungi on various substrata in Europe,\nnorth American and Asia, while little research exists on process(es)\nleading to the current distribution of marine fungi. Therefore, this\nstudy was initiated to examine the genetic structure of isolates\ncollected at various geographical locations of a cosmopolitan aquatic\nfungus, Lignincola laevis and thus its phylogeography. The internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS) and partial 28S region of the rRNA gene\nclusters and the partial MCM7 protein gene were sequenced and analysed\nusing maximum parsimony and Bayesian likelihood methods. Three distinct\nlineages were present in the sampled L. laevis isolates with high mean\npairwise distance between the groups. No geographical assemblages could\nbe identified in the phylogeny. These results suggest that Lignincola\nlaevis is a species complex and may contain a group of closely related\nspecies with subtle morphological differences including dimension of\nasci and ascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
