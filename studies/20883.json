It was\nelucidated that a dense taxon sampling, selection of appropriate target\ngenes, outgroup selection and alignment strategies influence the\nphylogenetic accuracy. Based on the genetic divergence, ITS2 yielded the\nhigher genetic distance, followed by cox1 and LSU. The morphological\ncharacters available for Pseudo-nitzschia, although limited in number,\nwere in agreement with the phylogenies when mapped onto the ITS2 trees.\nInformation on the presence or absence of a central nodule and changes\nin the number of rows of poroids revealed the evolution of the recently\ndiverged species. The morphologically based species complexes showed\nevolutionary relevance in agreement with ITS2 sequence-structure\ninferred molecular phylogeny. The taxonomic status of P. cuspidata and\nP. pseudodelicatissima requires further elucidation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"cox1 BI Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103581.phy"}]}
