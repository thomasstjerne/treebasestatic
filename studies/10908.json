Simulations suggest that\nthis is possible, but few empirical examples have demonstrated the\nability of molecular data to change the placement of fossil taxa. We\noffer such an example here. We analyze the placement of snakes among\nsquamate reptiles, combining published morphological data (363\ncharacters) and new DNA sequence data (15,794 characters, 22 nuclear\nloci) for 45 living and 19 fossil taxa. We find several intriguing\nresults. First, some fossil taxa undergo major changes in their\nphylogenetic position when molecular data are added. Second, most fossil\ntaxa are placed with strong support in the expected clades by the\ncombined data Bayesian analyses, despite each having >98% missing\ncells and despite recent suggestions that extensive missing data are\nproblematic for Bayesian phylogenetics. Third, morphological data can\nchange the placement of living taxa in combined analyses, even when\nthere is an overwhelming majority of molecular characters. Finally, we\nfind strong but apparently misleading signal in the morphological data,\nseemingly associated with a burrowing lifestyle in snakes,\namphisbaenians, and dibamids. Overall, our results suggest promise for\nan integrated and comprehensive Tree of Life by combining molecular and\nmorphological data for living and fossil taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25396.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25397.phy"},{"tree_label":"con comb all MB","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25389.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25390.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25398.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25401.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25392.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25399.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25404.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25402.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25403.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25393.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25394.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25395.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of living and fossil squamates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25400.phy"}]}
