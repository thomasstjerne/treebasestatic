Diversity and endemism are typically\nassessed by comparing species ranges across regions. However,\ninvestigation of patterns of species diversity alone misses out on the\nfull richness of patterns that can be inferred using a phylogenetic\napproach. Here, using Australian Acacia as an example, we show that the\napplication of phylogenetic methods, particularly two new measures,\nRelative Phylogenetic Diversity and Relative Phylogenetic Endemism,\ngreatly enhances our knowledge of biodiversity across both space and\ntime. We found that areas of high species richness and species endemism\nare not necessarily areas of high phylogenetic diversity or phylogenetic\nendemism. We propose a new method called Categorical Analysis of Neo-\nAnd Paleo-Endemism (CANAPE) that allows, for the first time, a clear,\nquantitative distinction between centers of neo- and paleo-endemism,\nuseful to the conservation decision-making process.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"510","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acacia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62284.phy"}]}
