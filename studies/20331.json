Several species were transferred to the genus\nSanghuangporus, which have perennial, effused-reflexed to pileate\nbasidiocarps, a dimitic tramal hyphal system, and a very wide zone of\nclimatic environment. In this study, we have analyzed a large sample of\nspecimens from this complex, and Sanghuangporus quercinus sp. nov,\ntreated previously as Sanghuangporus baumii, was identified as a new\nspecies from East Asia based on morephological and phylogenetic data.\nMorphologically, it is characterized by perennial, resupinate to\neffused-reflexed basidiocarps, a heterogeneous hyphal system with a\nmonomitic context and a dimitic hymenophoral trama, and broadly\nsubglobose to ovoid, thick-walled basidiospores 3-3.9 × 2.4-2.8 μm.\nPhylogenetically, the status of S. quercinus was strongly supported by\nphylogenetic analyses of nuclear internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS) sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRuleCon of 1000 MPTs","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inonotus linteus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101609.phy"}]}
