A new pterosaur from the Early\nCretaceous of Liaoning Province of China, Elanodactylus prolatus gen. et\nsp. nov., is described with mid-cervical vertebrae that bear these\nazhdarchid characters but has other postcranial material that are\ndistinct from the members of this group. Phylogenetic analysis of the\nnew species and the Pterodactyloidea places it with the Late Jurassic\nvertebrae in the Late JurassicÂ–Early Cretaceous Ctenochasmatidae and\nreveals that the characters of the elongate azhdarchid vertebrae\nappeared independently in both groups. These results are realized though\nthe large taxon sampling in the analysis demonstrating that the\nhomoplastic character states present in these two taxa were acquired in\na different order in their respective lineages. Some of these\nhomoplastic characters were previously thought to appear once in the\nhistory of pterosaurs and may be correlated to the extension of the neck\nregions in both groups. Because the homoplastic character states in the\nAzhdarchidae and Ctenochasmatidae are limited to the mid-cervical\nvertebrae, these states are termed convergent based on a definition of\nthe term in a phylogenetic context. A number of novel results from the\nanalysis presented produce a reorganization in the different species and\ntaxa of the Pterodactyloidea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"stored 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pterodactyloidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60093.phy"},{"tree_label":"stored 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pterodactyloidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60092.phy"}]}
