A new genus exclusive from the Asian\nregion, Asiabregma gen. nov., containing three species (A. makiharai sp.\nnov., A. ryukyuensis sp. nov., and A. sulaensis (van Achterberg), comb.\nnov.) is described. One new species of Aulosaphobracon, A. striatus sp.\nnov. from Vietnam, and one of Facitorus, F. amamioshimus sp. nov. from\nJapan, are also described. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses\nusing COI mtDNA and 28S rRNA sequences, the three genera previously\nplaced in the tribe Facitorini, Facitorus, Conobregma and Jannya,\ntogether with Asiabregma, are transferred to the rogadine tribe\nYeliconini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"COI MP","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1b","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2987.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S MP","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2988.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2986.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S Bayes","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2989.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI bayes","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Betylobraconinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2991.phy"}]}
