We addressed\nthese questions using three independently evolving palm (Arecaceae)\nlineages that are highly species-rich and rainforest indicators. We\nreconstructed the phylogenomic and biogeographic history of these major\ncomponents of rainforest vegetation, as a proxy to understand the\nprocesses that shaped the assembly of Central American rainforests.  Via\nthe Sequence Capture method, we sequenced the DNA of extensive sampling\ncollected in the field and living collections. Using 11 palm fossils, we\nreconstructed dated phylogenies, estimated ancestral geographic ranges,\nand determined species clustering in relation to geographic areas. \nGenomic data of over 200 palm species produced a well-resolved and\nrobust phylogeny, which revealed that intense and mostly local\ndiversification in Central America occurred 12-7 Ma.  Our results\nsuggest that megadiversification of tropical rain forests in Central\nAmerica was a recent process during the Miocene, despite the existence\nof South American rainforests since the Palaeocene (58 Ma). Although\nCentral America is an important biotic corridor, extant megadiversity is\nprimarily the result of local diversification not migration.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126529","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126529.phy"}]}
