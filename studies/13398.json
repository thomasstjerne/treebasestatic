Caesalpinioideae). We provide morphological, DNA\nsequence, habitat, and fruiting occurrence data for each species. The\nnew species conform to a generic concept of Clavulina that includes\ncoralloid, branched basidiomata with amphigenous hymenia, basidia with\ntwo or 2âˆ’4 incurved sterigmata and postpartal septa present or absent,\nand smooth, hyaline, guttulate basidiospores. Placements of the new\nspecies in Clavulina were corroborated with DNA sequence data from the\ninternal transcribed spacer and large subunit of the nuclear ribosomal\nrepeat, and their infrageneric relationships were examined with\nphylogenetic analyses based on DNA from the region coding for the second\nlargest subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (rpb2). To facilitate\nfuture studies of the genus in the neotropics, a key is provided for all\nClavulina species described from the lowland neotropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavulina Rooted maximum parsimony phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_57322.phy"}]}
