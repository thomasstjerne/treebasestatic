In April 2015, E. guineensis leaves showing elliptical necrotic\nspots with yellowish halo were observed in a commer‐ cial plantation in\nMoju, Pará state, Brazil. A synematous fungus was consistently observed\nassociated with the necrotic spots. The aim of this study was to\nidentify this fungus associated with E. guineensis in Brazil. Based on\nmorphology and DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer\nrDNA, the fungus was identified as Helminthosporiella stilbacea.\nHelmintosporiella stilbacea has been reported associated with leaf spots\non E. guineensis in Africa, Ghana, Sudan and Zambia. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first report of H. stilbacea associated with E.\nguineensis in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Untitled Tree","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108980","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108980.phy"}]}
