However, many taxonomic groups remain largely\nunstudied, echinoderms being one conspicuous example. The brittle star\nAstrotoma agassizii is distributed widely throughout Antarctica and\nsouthern South America. This species is a brooding echinoderm and\ntherefore may have limited dispersal capacity. In order to determine the\neffect of hypothesized isolating barriers in the Southern Ocean, such as\ndepth, geographic distance and the Polar Front, two mtDNA markers were\nused to compare populations from the South American and Antarctic\ncontinental shelves. Astrotoma agassizii was shown to be genetically\ndiscontinuous across the Polar Front. In fact, populations previously\nassumed to be panmictic instead represent three separate lineages that\nlack morphological distinction. However, within lineages, genetic\ncontinuity was displayed across a large geographic range (> 500 km).\nTherefore, despite lacking a pelagic larval stage, A. agassizii can\ndisperse across substantial geographic distance within continental shelf\nregions. These results indicate that geographic distance alone may not\nbe a barrier to dispersal, but rather the combined effects of distance,\ndepth and the Polar Front act to prevent gene flow between A. agassizii\npopulations in the Southern Ocean.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astrotoma agassizii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3006.phy"}]}
