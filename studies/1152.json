We compare the genus with other\naquatic ascomycetes with falcate septate ascospores: e.g.,\nPseudohalonectria and Ophioceras. Ascospores differ from species in\nthese genera in being brown with lighter end cells. Also, the ascus pore\nis subapical, with a channel leading to the apex. Lollipopaia minuta\ndiffers from Phruensis brunneispora in that the ascomata are borne in a\nstroma, asci have an apical pore and the ascospores are hyaline. No\ngenus was found to accommodate the new species. Molecular analysis of\nrDNA ribosomal 18S confirmed the exclusion of the new species from\nPseudohalonectria and Ophioceras and Lollipopaia minuta formed a sister\ngroup with it. Phruensis brunneispora and Lollipopaia minuta grouped in\nthe Diaporthales with 100% bootstrap support. Therefore, both\nmorphological and molecular evidence support erecting a new genus to\naccommodate this taxon. A hyaline Phialophora-like anamorph was formed\nwhen single ascospores were plated out on agar. The taxon is described\nand illustrated with light micrographs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aquatic fungi from peat swamp palms, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_637.phy"}]}
