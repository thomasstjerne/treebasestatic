The results indicate that all\ngenera are monophyletic as presently circumscribed, and that red-fruited\ndiploid Empetrum, today found in the Southern Hemisphere, are the\nsister-group of the black-fruited crowberries. Black-fruited, as well as\npurple-fruited, tetraploid crowberries are hypothesized to have evolved\nfrom diploid black-fruited ancestors in the Northern Hemisphere. The\npresent investigation casts new light on the evolution and biogeography\nof the family and shows the fallacy of assuming that small disjunct\npopulations must be derived from larger, more widespread ones.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Empetraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1541.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Empetraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1542.phy"}]}
