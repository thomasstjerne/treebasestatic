The monophyly of these three subclades as well as a\nsubclade containing representatives of Coronophorales and Melanospora is\nwell supported statistically. However, relationships among the different\nsubclades remain largely unresolved. A sister relationship for this\ngroup with Hypocreales is significantly supported by Bayesian and\nmaximum likelihood methods. In addition to the Halospheariales and\nLulworthiales, this clade, which is characterized by considerable\nmorphological and ecological diversity, represents a third major clade\nof marine Sordariomycetes","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine fungal Hypocreomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6032.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine fungal Hypocreomycetidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6502.phy"}]}
