While few of the mesophilic species imply biotechnological\nimportance in biotransformation of steroids or as producers of\nrennin-like components, the species with higher growth temperature\noptima are of clinical relevance as opportunistic human pathogens. The\naim of this study was to investigate the phylogenetic relationships\nbetween these species and to establish a revision of their systematics.\nFor this purpose single and combined genealogies based on distance,\nmaximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of aligned\nnucleotide sequences of the nuclear-encoded genes for actin (act) and\nfor the 5.8S ribosomal RNA flanked by the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) regions 1 and 2 (comprising 807 and 828 characters, respectively)\nof 16 Absidia species were reconstructed. The phylogenetic\nreconstructions suggest a trichotomy of the Absidia genus consisting of\na mesophilic, a fast-growing thermotolerant and a slowly-growing\nmycoparasitic Absidia group. The trichotomous phylogenetic grouping is\nconcordant with the morphology of the zygospores, which are zygotes\nresulting from sexual conjugation between two compatible mating\npartners. Whereas the mesophilic group comprises the majority of\nabsidiaceaeous species forming sterile hair\u001alike, mycelial appendages on\nthe suspensors of their zygospores, the thermotolerant group is\ncharacterised by the formation of smooth-walled and the mycoparasitic\ngroup, namely Absidia parricida and A. zychae, by Mucor-like\nrough-walled zygospores. Based on the phylogenetic coherence of\nmesophilic and thermotolerant Absidia species, we propose to separate\nboth groups into two distinct genera, Absidia for the mesophilic Absidia\nspecies resembling the Absidiaceae and Mycocladus for the thermotolerant\nspecies A. corymbifera, A. blakesleeana and A. hyalospora. Because\nMycocladus is physiologically, phylogenetically and morphologically\ndistinct from the Absidiaceae sensu stricto we suggest to classify them\ninto a separate family, the Mycocladiaceae fam. nov. which comprises the\nthree species Mycocladus corymbifer, M. blakesleeanus and M.\nhyalospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_343.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 s3a","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2774.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 s1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2770.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 s2a","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2771.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 s2b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2772.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 s3b","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2773.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2775.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 s1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2776.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 s2b","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2777.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 s2a","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2778.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 s3a","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2779.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 s3b","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Absidia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2780.phy"}]}
