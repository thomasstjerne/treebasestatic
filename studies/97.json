The intergeneric\nboundaries are analysed using cladistic methodology on morphological\ndata by means of a computerized parsimony program. All currently\nrecognized species in the three genera were included in the analysis in\nwhich 120 equally parsimonious cladograms were found. A consensus tree\nis presented along with one of the most parsimonious cladograms chosen\nby successive weighting. The genera Athroisma and Blepharispermum are\nshown to be well delimited if one species, Blepharispermum subsessile,\nis excluded and placed in a separate genus. The genus Leucoblepharis,\nusually treated as a congener of Blepharispermum, is here reinstated. A\nkey to and short descriptions of the three genera are supplied along\nwith a more detailed treatment of Leucoblepharis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoblepharis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4344.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoblepharis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4345.phy"}]}
