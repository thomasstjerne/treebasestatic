The phylogenetic tree of Colletotrichum\noscimae shows the close relation with Colletotrichum yulongense and\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides. The Colletotrichum lebbeckae show the\nclose relation with Colletotrichum fusiforme and Colletotrichum acidae\nin the phylogeny. The both species are different to all closely related\nspecies based on the phylogenetic analysis of ITS and LSU gene\nsequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132689","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132689.phy"}]}
