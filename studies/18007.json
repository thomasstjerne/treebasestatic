Here we characterize the isolate morphologically\nand cytologically and name it D. primogenitus. Molecular sequences from\nthe nuclear large subunit gene and internal transcribed spacer indicated\nthat it is closely related to the South American D. indacocheae with\nwhich it agrees structurally. Both species form conidia on the\nbasidiocarp and D. primogenitus also forms them on the mycelium. Unlike\npreviously reports for the Dacrymycetales postmeiotic nuclear division\nresults in uninucleate basidiospores and six residual nuclei in the\nbasidium after spore discharge. Ultrastructural analysis shows the\ncharacteristic septal pore apparatus for the class and endogenous origin\nof the epibasidia/sterigmata, which may be a common occurrence in\nDacrymycetes and the early diverging orders of its sister class, the\nAgaricomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dacrymycetes ITS and LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89263.phy"}]}
