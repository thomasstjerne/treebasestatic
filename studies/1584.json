One of the classic\npatterns of plant disjunction involves New World amphitropical\ndisjuncts, as exemplified by Tiquilia subg. Tiquilia (Boraginaceae).\nSubgenus Tiquilia forms a heterogeneous group of ~20 species that is\namphitropically distributed in the deserts of North and South America,\nwith four taxa endemic to the Gal\u001apagos Islands. The current study\nreconstructs the biogeographic history of subg. Tiquilia in order to\nexplore the origins of New World amphitropical disjunction and of\nGal\u001apagos endemism. A strongly supported phylogeny of the subgenus is\nestimated using sequence data from matK, ndhF, rps16, ITS, and waxy.\nBiogeographic analyses using combined and individual marker data sets\nreveal a complex history of long-distance dispersal in subg. Tiquilia.\nBiogeographic reconstructions imply a North American origin of the\nsubgenus and its three major lineages, and require at least four\nlong-distance dispersal events to explain its current distribution. The\nSouth American taxa of subg. Tiquilia result from three independent and\nnonsimultaneous colonization events, while the monophyly and continental\norigins of the Gal\u001apagos endemics are unresolved. This study contributes\nto a growing body of evidence that intercontinental dispersal has been\nmore common than previously realized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tiquilia plicata clade, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2524.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tiquilia subg.
