Neocordana is established to accommodate Cordana\nmusae, C. johnstonii, C. versicolor, and a previously undescribed\nspecies, N. muscicola, which is morphologically and phylogenetically\ndistinct. Neocordana species are found to be associated with leaves of\nMusa spp. (Musaceae) and Canna denudata (Cannaceae). Based on these\nresults, Cordanaceae is best recognized in a separate order, established\nhere as Cordanales ord. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocordana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102074.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neocordana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102076.phy"}]}
