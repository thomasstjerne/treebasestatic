Huperzia is resolved as paraphyletic to the\nmorphologically divergent, monotypic, Australasian Phylloglossum. The\nHuperzia-Phylloglossum clade is strongly supported and is sister group\nto a Lycopodium-Lycopodiella clade. These results provide the first\nclear evidence for the relationships of the problematic Phylloglossum\ndrummondii. Profound differences in life cycle and morphology between\nPhylloglossum and other Lycopodiaceae are interpreted in terms of\npaedomorphosis (specifically progenesis) and are viewed as adaptive\nresponses to drought and brush fire. Our results show that rbcL sequence\ndivergence among neotropical species of the supposedly ancient genus\nHuperzia is extremely low, and that additional data will be necessary to\nresolve relationships among epiphytes and ground-living species. These\nsurprisingly low levels of sequence divergence indicate that most living\nspecies diversity within Lycopodiaceae is of relatively recent origin.\nOur results are consistent with a Late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary\norigin and diversification of epiphytic species within Huperzia, and\nthese events may be linked to the diversification of angiosperms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycopodiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3541.phy"}]}
