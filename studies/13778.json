{"Authors":" Bastian Bentlage","Year":" 2010","Title":" Evolution of box jellyfish (Cnidaria: Cubozoa), a group of\nhighly toxic invertebrates","Journal":" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological\nSciences","Volume":" 277","Issue":" 1680","Pages":" 493-501","Keywords":" Cubozoa, box jellyfish, phylogeny, systematics","DOI":" 10.1098/rspb.2009.1707","Abstract":" Cubozoa (Cnidaria: Medusozoa) represents a small clade of\napproximately 50 described species, some of which cause serious human\nenvenomations. Our understanding of the evolutionary history of Cubozoa\nhas been limited by the lack of a sound phylogenetic hypothesis for the\ngroup. Here, we present a comprehensive cubozoan phylogeny based on\nribosomal genes coding for near-complete nuclear 18S (small subunit) and\n28S (large subunit) and partial mitochondrial 16S. We discuss the\nimplications of this phylogeny for our understanding of cubozoan venom\nevolution, biogeography and life-history evolution. Our phylogenetic\nhypothesis suggests that: (i) the last common ancestor of Carybdeida\nprobably possessed the mechanism(s) underlying Irukandji syndrome, (ii)\ndeep divergences between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific clades may be\nexplained by ancient vicariant events, and (iii) sexual dimorphism\nevolved a single time in concert with complex sexual behaviour.\nFurthermore, several cubozoan taxa are either para- or polyphyletic, and\nwe address some of these taxonomic issues by designating a new family,\nCarukiidae, a new genus, Copula, and by redefining the families\nTamoyidae and Tripedaliidae. Lastly, cubozoan species identities have\nlong been misunderstood and the data presented here support many of the\nrecent scientific descriptions of cubozoan species. However, the results\nof a phylogeographic analysis of Alatina moseri from Hawaiâ€™i and Alatina\nmordens from Australia indicate that these two nominal species represent\na single species that has maintained metapopulation cohesion by natural\nor anthropogenic dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Evolution of Box Jellyfish","tree_kind":"Species
