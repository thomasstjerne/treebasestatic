Most\nphylogenetic studies have produced conflicting results for many clades,\nand even the relationships among genera remain uncertain. To clarify\ngalagid evolutionary history, we assembled the largest molecular dataset\nfor galagos to date by sequencing 27 independent loci. We inferred\nphylogenetic relationships using concatenated maximum-likelihood (ML)\nand Bayesian analyses, and also coalescent-based species tree methods to\naccount for gene tree heterogeneity due to incomplete lineage\nsorting.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML_tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Galagids MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_71568.phy"},{"tree_label":"GBlocks_ML_tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Galagids GBlocks MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_71570.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB_tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"African Galagids MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_71569.phy"}]}
