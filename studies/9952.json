This study provides some information\nregarding fungi associated with necrotic leaflets of exotic palms in\nThailand. Specimens in this work were collected from several locations\nin Chiang Mai province, including natural and planted areas. One new\nspecies, Cercospora arecacearum from areca palm (Areca catechu), is\ndescribed and illustrated. ITS sequence data analysis confirms the\nseparation of the new Cercospora species from related taxa. Another\nspecies, Neorehmia arecae, hitherto known from areca palm, is newly\nrecorded for Thailand and from a new host palm, Wallichia\nsiamensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP Strict Con","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arecacearum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6430.phy"}]}
