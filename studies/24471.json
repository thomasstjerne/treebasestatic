Sequencing of the ribosomal\nnuc rDNA ITS5-5.8S-ITS4 (ITS) and nuc 28S rDNA (28S) regions confirmed\nthat these specimens belonged to two new species, here described as T.\nmollis and T. torrendii. Trechispora mollis has a densely hydnoid\nhymenophore and is most similar to T. nivea, but differs clearly by the\npresence of inflated cells in the subiculum. Trechispora torrendii has a\nminutely grandinioid hymenophore similar to T. farinacea and\nmorphological differences between them are subtle, but genetically these\ntwo species are well separated. The new combinations T. brasiliensis, T.\nmellina and Xenasmatella alnicola (= T. alnicola) are proposed, and new\nrecords from Brazilian regions and biomes are reported. Macro- and\nmicro-descriptions, line-drawings, a key to Brazilian species of the\ngenus and phylogenetic trees based on ITS and 28S are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trechispora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118268.phy"}]}
