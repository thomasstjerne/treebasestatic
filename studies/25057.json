Pluteus keselakii is characterised by a brown\npileipellis largely composed of sphaeropedunculate to broadly clavate\nelements, a whitish stipe covered entirely by distinct brown floccules\nconsisting of caulocystidia in tufts, narrowly utriform to utriform or\nfusiform pleurocystidia with obtuse apex and a brown lamella edge (at\nleast near the pileus margin). Pluteus keselakii is macromorphologically\nsimilar to P. floccipes and phylogenetically (ITS rDNA) close to P.\nmultiformis. The distinctive sequences of the ITS and EF1-Î± gene\nregions, however, support the status of P. keselakii as a new\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pluteus keselakii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121029.phy"}]}
