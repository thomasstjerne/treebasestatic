In addition to the studies of Hjortstam and Ryvarden\n(Syn Fung 15:717, 2002; Syn Fung 26:3355, 2009), 35 new combinations are\nproposed, based on morphological and/or phylogenetic information. A list\nof species, a phylogenetic tree with eight new sequences from holotypes\nand three other previously unsequenced species, emendations of the\ngenera and new keys to all accepted species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphodontia s.l.
