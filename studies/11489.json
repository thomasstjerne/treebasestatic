Surprisingly, a rigorous\nassessment of the age of an asexual plant lineage has never been\npublished, although asexuality is extraordinarily common among plants.\nHere we estimate the ages of sexual diploids and asexual polyploids in\nthe fern genus Astrolepis using a well-supported plastid phylogeny and a\nrelaxed-clock dating approach. The 50 asexual polyploid samples we\nincluded were conservatively estimated to comprise 19 distinct lineages,\nincluding a variety of auto- and allopolyploid genomic combinations. All\nwere either the same age or younger than the crown group comprising\ntheir maternal sexual-diploid parents based simply on their phylogenetic\nposition. Node ages estimated with the relaxed-clock approach indicated\nthat the average maximum age of asexual lineages was 0.4 Mya, and\nindividual lineages were on average 7 to 47 times younger than the\ncrown- and total-ages of their sexual parents. Although the confounding\nassociation between asexuality and polyploidy precludes definite\nconclusions regarding the effect of asexuality, our results suggest that\nasexuality limits evolutionary potential in Astrolepis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astrolepis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46024.phy"}]}
