Pestalotiopsis-like fungi diseases were\nstudied in vineyards in nine provinces across China. Multi-gene (ITS,\n-tubulin and tef1) analysis coupled with morphology showed that a\nNeopestalotiopsis sp. and Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola are associated\nin causing grapevine fruit rot and trunk diseases in China.\nPestalotiopsis trachicarpicola is reported as the causative agent of\ngrapevine diseases in the world for the first time. Neopestalotiopsis\nsp. caused significantly longer lesions than the other taxon present.\nThis study represents the first attempt to identify and characterize the\nPestalotiopsis-like fungi causing grapevine diseases in China using both\nmorphological and molecular approaches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotiopsis-like fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79340.phy"}]}
