Pleurospermum\ns. s. includes one or two closely related boreal species but more than\n40 other species, distributed mainly in the Sino-Himalayan floristic\narea, have been attributed to it by different authors in various\nclassifications (Clarke 1879; Drude 189798; Wolff 1925, 1926, 1929;\nMukherjee and Constance 1993; Pan ZeHui 2005). Relationships in this\ntaxonomic group are unclear. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of\nnuclear (nrITS) and cpDNA (psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF) sequences of\nrepresentative species of Pleurospermum s. l. and closely related\nHymenidium, Aulacospermum, Trachydium, Physospermopsis,\nPseudotrachydium, Sinolimprichtia, Pterocyclus, and Hymenolaena (55\nspecies in all) was conducted and compared with an analysis of\nmorphological characters of Pimenov and Kljuykov 2000a,b; Pimenov et\nal. 2000. Only two traditional genera were supported as monophyletic\ngroups in the molecular trees, namely Aulacospermum (including\nPseudotrachydium) and Hymenolaena. Two stable groups were revealed\nwithin Hymenidium. One group included H. chloroleucum, H.\nheterosciadium, H. hookeri, and H. delavayi. The second included H.\nlindleyanum, H. stellatum, H. huzhihaoi, H. wilsonii, and Trachydium\nroylei. Various species of Hymenidium and Trachydium were scattered\nthroughout the tree. The molecular data did not confirm an early\ndivergence between northern and Sino-Himalayan species of Pleurospermum.\nThis indicates that Pleurospermum s. l. and most of the other genera\nincluded in this study are polyphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Hym its22","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurospermum s. l.","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49215.phy"},{"tree_label":"ita.con","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurospermum s. l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49221.phy"},{"tree_label":"psbA trnH.con","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurospermum s. l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49222.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL trnF.con","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurospermum s. l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49224.phy"},{"tree_label":"its.con","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleurospermum s. l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49223.phy"}]}
