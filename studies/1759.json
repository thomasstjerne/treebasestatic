Here, we present a molecular\nphylogeny of Thamnophlius antshrikes, a clade of 30 species whose\ncollective distribution spans nearly the entirety of lowland habitats in\ntropical South America, the eastern slope foothills of the Andes, and\nthe tepuis of northern South America. Our goal was to examine the role\nof the Andes in the diversification of lowland and foothill species.\nUsing parsimony and Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions of a\nthree-state distribution character (lowland-restricted,\nlowland-to-highland, highland-restricted), we found that the Andes were\ncolonized two times independently and the tepuis once from\nlowland-restricted ancestors. Over the entire evolutionary history of\nThamnophilus, the highest transition rates were between\nhighland-restricted and lowland-to-highland distributions, with\nextremely low rates into or out of lowland-restricted distributions.\nThis pattern suggests lowland-restricted distributions are limited not\nby physiological constraints, but by other forces, such as competition.\nThese results highlight the need for additional comparative studies in\nelucidating processes associated with the colonization and\ndifferentiation of high-elevation habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: most-likely tree for\nbeta-fibrinogen, intron 7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_328.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: one of two most-likely trees\nfor cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2f","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: most-likely tree for combined\ndata set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4667.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: one of three most-likely trees\nfor ND3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4662.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: most-likely tree for\nbeta-fibrinogen, intron 5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: one of two most-likely trees\nfor cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4664.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: one of three most-likely trees\nfor ND3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4660.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: one of three most-likely trees\nfor ND3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4661.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnophilus phylogeny: most-likely tree for ND2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4663.phy"}]}
