Armillaria species have been well\nstudied in North America and Europe, but have received minimal attention\nin South Africa. Most reports of Armillaria root rot in South Africa\nsuggest that A. mellea (Vahl.:Fr.) P. Kumm. is the causal agent. The\nname A. heimii Pegler has also been used in more recent reports,\nalthough these have not been based on mycological studies. The taxonomic\ndisposition of Armillaria in South Africa, therefore, remains unknown.\nThe aim of this study was to identify and characterise Armillaria\nisolates from forest plantations in South Africa based on morphological\ndata, PCR-RFLP profiles and sequence data. Analysis of these characters\nrevealed that the isolates originating from the plantations in South\nAfrica are distinct from A. mellea and A. heimii. We believe that they\nrepresent A. fuscipes Petch.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 10","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3787.phy"}]}
