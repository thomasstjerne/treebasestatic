Consistent patterns are seen across shallow\nportions of the trees. Uncertainty remains concerning the placement of\nseveral deep branches within this groupâ€™s phylogeny. In particular, the\nphylogenetic placement of Meropogon forsteni and Merops breweri, M.\nornatus, M. hirundineus and M. boehmi remains uncertain. The\nbiogeographic patterns in the resultant trees are similar with either a\nSoutheast Asian or African origin for the family, with most of the early\ndiversification occurring in Africa, and with multiple independent\nsubsequent invasions of non-African areas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meropidae 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1719.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meropidae consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1720.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meropidae 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1716.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meropidae 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1717.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Meropidae 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1718.phy"}]}
