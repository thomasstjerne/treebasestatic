In this study, their systematic relationship was\nclarified by using molecular phylogenetic analysis which resolved the\nspecies in two different clades. Diagnostic morphological characters\nwere further revealed by detailed comparison of almost all the known\ncollections. Although overlaps were found in most of the investigated\nmorphological characters, the venation and silica bodies were found to\nbe useful for species delimitation. Type information, field images,\nillustrations, and taxonomic notes are provided for both species. A new\ncombination Haplopteris capillaris is made and its occurrence in Taiwan\nas independent gametophytes is confirmed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haplopteris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115639.phy"}]}
