In certain taxa,\nITS is nearly exclusively used for population level or inter-specific\nstudies, despite the frequent presence of divergent paralogs within\nindividual genomes that can be phylogenetically confounding. For the\nfirst time, we survey diverse marine sponges to determine the extent and\nphylogenetic implications of intragenomic polymorphisms (IGPs) exhibited\nat their ITS loci. We discover that the extent of IGP varies greatly\nbetween taxa (with most taxa exhibiting very few) and cannot be\npredicted by taxonomy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ITS can be\nphylogenetically informative between species when moderate levels of\nIGPs are detected, but that ITS paralogy can interfere with population\nlevel studies. We caution against the routine use of ITS in phylogenetic\nstudies of sponges without 1) screening for IGPs in every specimen\nsampled; 2) including all divergent paralogs in phylogenetic analyses;\n3) testing ITS data using other single-copy, unlinked loci (such as\nnuclear introns).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucettidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1863.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Prosuberites","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1864.phy"}]}
