In the present study,\nthe diversity of members of the Botryosphaeriaceae isolated from\nsymptomatic wood of Prunus species (plum, peach, nectarine and apricot)\nwas determined in different stone fruit growing areas in South Africa.\nMorphological and cultural characteristics as well as DNA sequence data\n(5.8S rDNA, ITS-1, ITS-2 and EF-1?) were used to identify known, and\ndescribe novel members of Botryosphaeriaceae. From the total number of\nwood samples collected (258), 67 isolates of Botryosphaeriaceae were\nobtained, from which eight species were identified. All species were\nassociated with wood necrosis. Diplodia seriata (= \u001aBotryosphaeria\u001a\nobtusa) was dominant, and present on all four Prunus species sampled,\nfollowed by Neofusicoccum vitifusiforme and N. australe. First reports\nfrom Prunus spp. include N. vitifusiforme, Dothiorella viticola and\nDiplodia pinea. This is also the first report of D. mutila from South\nAfrica. Two species are newly described, namely Lasiodiplodia plurivora\nsp. nov. from P. salicina, and Diplodia africana sp. nov. from P.\npersica. All species, except Dothiorella viticola, caused lesions on\ngreen nectarine and/or plum shoots in a detached shoot pathogenicity\nassay.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae on Prunus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2913.phy"}]}
