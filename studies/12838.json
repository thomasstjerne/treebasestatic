Higher level relationships among\nHymenoptera have been notoriously difficult to resolve with both\nmorphological and traditional molecular approaches. Here we examined the\nutility of expressed sequence tags for resolving relationships among\nhymenopteran superfamilies. Transcripts were assembled for 6 disparate\nHymenopteran taxa with additional sequences added from public databases\nfor a final dataset of 24 genes for 16 taxa and over 10kb of sequence\ndata. The concatenated dataset recovered a robust and well-supported\ntopology demonstrating the monophyly of Holometabola, Hymenoptera,\nApocrita, Aculeata, Ichneumonoidea, and a sister relationship between\nthe two most closely related proctotrupomorphs in the dataset\n(Cynipoidea + Proctotrupoidea). The data strongly supported a sister\nrelationship between Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha, contrary to\npreviously proposed hypotheses. Additionally there was strong evidence\nindicating Ichneumonoidea as sister to Aculeata + Proctotrupomorpha.\nThese relationships were robust to missing data, nucleotide composition\nbiases, low taxonomic sampling, and conflicting signal across gene\ntrees. There was also strong evidence indicating that Chalcidoidea is\nnot contained within Proctotrupomorpha.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CG4800","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53502.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG2746","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53497","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53497.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG3186","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53498","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53498.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG8900","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53501.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG11271","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53505.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG8332","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53496.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG7424","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53495.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG6779","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53503.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG11981","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53506.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG7939","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53499","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53499.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG3997","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53516.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG7434","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53515.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG4097","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53513.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG6770","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53512.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG4169","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53510.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG3446","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53509.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG15442","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53511.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG6803","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53504.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG8857","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53500","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53500.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG8415","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53494.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG7178","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53508.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG2099","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53507.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG1746","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53514.phy"},{"tree_label":"CG3661","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53493.phy"}]}
