This study\nidentified the pathogen that causes grapevine canker in most grapevine\nculture areas of China and verified the pathogenicity and geographical\ndistribution of isolates. In total, 320 disease samples were collected\nfrom 17 provinces between 2009 and 2011, and 4261 isolates were purified\nfrom disease samples. Of these, 1172 isolates purified from 150 samples\nwere identified as B. dothidea by morphological and molecular\ncharacterizations. Three representative isolates were used to determine\noptimal temperature and optimal nutrition medium trail. Isolate\npathogenicity was determined for 25 grapevine cultivars. The results\nshowed that grapevine canker caused by B. dothidea commonly occurred and\nthat most of the main grapevine cultivars in China are susceptible to\nthe pathogen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr50449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50449.phy"}]}
