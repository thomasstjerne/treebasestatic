Using a sophisticated extension of the PCR\ntechnique, we have successfully isolated two single-copy nuclear genes,\nDMC1 and EF-G, from each of the three genomes found in hexaploid wheat\n(BAuD) and from the two genomes of the tetraploid progenitor T. turgidum\n(BAu). By subjecting these sequences to phylogenetic analysis together\nwith sequences from representatives of all the diploid Triticeae genera\nwe are able for the first time to provide simultaneous and strongly\nsupported evidence for the D genome being derived from Aegilops\ntauschii, the Au genome being derived from Triticum urartu, and the\nhitherto enigmatic B genome being derived from Aegilops speltoides.\nPrevious problems of identifying the B genome donor may be associated\nwith a higher diversification rate of the B genome compared to the Au\ngenome in the polyploid wheats. The phylogenetic hypothesis further\nsuggests that neither Triticum, Aegilops, nor Triticum plus Aegilops are\nmonophyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triticum and Aegilops","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59126.phy"}]}
