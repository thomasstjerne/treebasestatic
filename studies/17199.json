In the present study, 130\nnew sequences were newly analyzed, with the combination of plastid genes\nand nrDNA ITS regions through Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference\nanalyses. It confirms that neither subgenus Auganthus nor subgenus\nCarolinella is monophyletic in their current circumscription. The\ncalyptrate capsule as a diagnostic morphological criterion for subgenus\nCarolinella may have experienced multiple occurrences in Primula.\nSubgenus Auganthus would be a natural group only if with inclusion of\nsubgenus Carolinella and exclusion of P. aromatica. Positions of some\ninfrageneric groups are clarified, challenges remain regarding relevant\nmorphological characters for sectional delimitations within subgenus\nAuganthus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85953","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85953.phy"}]}
