Species of Astrosphaeriella have been previously\ncircumscribed on the basis of morphology and, to a lesser extent, on\nhost affiliation. In order to obtain a phylogenetic understanding of the\ngenus, eleven strains of Astrosphaeriella sensu lato were sequenced in\nthis study. Molecular analyses based on a combined dataset of 18S and\n28S nrDNA sequences were carried out to infer the phylogenetic placement\nof these strains in the Pleosporales. The phylogenetic analyses showed\nthat Astrosphaeriella is polyphyletic, with Astrosphaeriella species\nclustering in four clades, two clades, including species with slit-like\nostioles, clustered in Aigialaceae; the clade that includes the generic\ntype clustered together with Delitschia; and A. africana, which has\nstriate ascospores, deviated from these three clades and had a basal\nposition in the Pleosporales. A new combination in Fissuroma gen. nov.\nand new genus Neoastrosphaeriella are introduced in Aigialaceae to\ninclude the species with slit-like ascomata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Astrosphaeriella LSU SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58112.phy"}]}
