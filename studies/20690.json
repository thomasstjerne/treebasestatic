Morphological and physiological examination of\nArgentinean isolates indicated that they are able to grow above 37Â°C, in\ncontrast with A. ustus isolates; and give a negative Ehrlich reaction in\ncontrast with the related species A. calidoustus. Combined morphological\nand physiological features are sufficient to distinguish the new species\nfrom related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CaM A. fuscicans","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102681","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_102681.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA A. fuscicans","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102680","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_102680.phy"}]}
