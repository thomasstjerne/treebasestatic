We here use\nmorphometrics of wing veins and an integrative Bayesian analysis to\nplace a new rock fossil species from the Danish Fur Formation (~54 Ma)\nin the tree of Darwin wasps. The new species, which we call Pherhombus\nparvulus (sp. nov.), is placed firmly in Pherhombinae, an extinct\nsubfamily so far only known from Baltic and Rovno ambers. Our\nphylogenetic analysis recovers a subfamily clade within the higher\nOphioniformes formed by Pherhombinae, Townesitinae and Hybrizontinae, in\naccordance with previous suggestions. Due to the placement of the new\nspecies as sister to the remaining members of Pherhombinae, we argue\nthat our finding is not at odds with a much younger, late Eocene age of\nBaltic amber and instead demonstrates that Pherhombus existed over a\nmuch longer period than previously thought. Our results also exemplify\nthe power of wing vein morphometrics and integrative phylogenetic\nanalyses in resolving the placement even of poorly preserved fossil\nspecimens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus tree","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132047","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132047.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132048","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132048.phy"}]}
