Relationships between genera in the tribe\nCecropieae (Urticaceae), including Cecropia, Coussapoa, Musanga,\nMyrianthus, and Pourouma, are unknown and are necessary to investigate\nthe evolutionary history of the Cecropia-ant mutualism. Bayesian\nphylogenetic analysis of the NADH dehydrogenase (ndhF) chloroplast gene\nregion, the 26S region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, and an exon-primed\nintron-crossing DNA region supports the position of non-myrmecophytic\nAfrican Musanga within a paraphyletic Cecropia. Neotropical Pourouma and\nCoussapoa are supported as sister taxa with African Myrianthus as their\nclosest relative. Although it remains uncertain whether myrmecophytism\nwas the ancestral condition of the Cecropia clade, a close relationship\nbetween non-myrmecophytic Cecropia sciadophylla and Musanga suggests\nthat the loss of ant associations did not accompany African\ncolonization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cecropieae 50% majority rule Bayesian 3 loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90960.phy"}]}
