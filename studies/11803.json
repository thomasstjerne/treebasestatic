Results of the\nphylogenetic analyses incorporating data for representatives of other\nlygoso- mine genera indicated that the basal phylogenetic split within\nTropidophorus separated a clade of continental Indochinese species\nexclusive of T. cocincinensis and T. microlepis from one compris- ing T.\ncocincinensis, T. microlepis and species from Borneo, Sulawesi and the\nPhilippines. Of the latter group, the two continental species form the\nsister taxon to a clade comprising the island species. Diversification\namong species in Indochina and among Borneo, the Philippines and\nSulawesi was likely concentrated in the Miocene, with no apparent\ndispersal among these regions during the Pleistocene. The body\ndepression recognized in several Indochinese species is likely to have\noccurred twice in parallel as an adaptation to saxicolous habitats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr47814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_47814.phy"}]}
