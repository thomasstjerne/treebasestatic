As a result,\ngeneric circumscriptions based exclusively on macromorphology often\nprove to be non-monophyletic. Ongoing molecular phylogenetic analyses\nare providing the foundation for a revised classification of this\nchallenging group and have begun to clarify its complex evolutionary\nhistory. As part of this effort, we generated and analyzed DNA sequence\ndata for three plastid loci (rbcL, atpA, and the intergenic spacer\ntrnGÂ–trnR) for the myriopterid clade, one of the largest monophyletic\ngroups of cheilanthoid ferns. This lineage encompasses 47 primarily\nNorth and Central American taxa previously included in Cheilanthes but\nnow placed in the recircumscribed genus Myriopteris. Here, we infer a\nphylogeny for the group and examine key morphological characters across\nthis phylogeny. We also include a brief discussion of the three\nwell-supported Myriopteris subclades, along with a review of\nreproductive mode and known ploidy levels for members of this early\ndiverging lineage of cheilanthoid ferns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myriopteris, bayesian PP","tree_kind":"Species
