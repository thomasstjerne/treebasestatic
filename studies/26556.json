While they can be gastronomically valued and nutritionally\nimportant, it has long been recognized that only select species of\nmushrooms are suitable for consumption. Adverse health effects of\nconsuming poisonous mushrooms range from mild illness to death. Many\nvaluable edible mushrooms are unable to be grown commercially, or it is\nimpractical to do so, requiring them to be harvested from the wild.\nProducts containing these wild-collected mushrooms are often sold with\nthe nonspecific and undefined label “wild mushrooms,” although in some\ncases particular species are listed in the ingredients. However, the\nambiguity of the definition of “wild mushrooms” in foods makes it\nimpossible to know which species are involved or whether they are truly\nwild-collected or cultivated varieties. As a consequence, any individual\nadverse reactions to consuming the mushrooms in these products cannot be\ntraced to the source due to the minimal regula- tions around the harvest\nand sale of wild mushrooms. For this study, we set out to shed light on\nwhat species of fungi are being sold as “wild mushrooms” using DNA\nmetabarcoding to identify fungal contents of various food products\nacquired from locally sourced grocers and a large online retail site.\nTwenty-six species of mushroom were identified across 12 food products,\nranging from commonly cultivated species to wild species not represented\nin global DNA databases. One product labeled as “porcini” (a popular\nwild-collected group of edible mushrooms) was shown to contain\npotentially toxic species, including an Amanita sp. implicated in\ncausing renal failure. Three of the food products sequenced were found\nto contain mushroom species that are widely considered as poisonous.\nThis study demonstrates that a large variety of fungi can be sold as\n“wild mushrooms,” even those that are commonly cultivated at industrial\nscales, and that ingredient labels do not always accurately describe the\nspecies included. Of more immediate concern, we demonstrate that\npoisonous mushrooms are being packaged and sold as food with a large\ndistribution potential.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124512.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124516.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124511.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124510.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124505.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124509.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124515.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124500","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124500.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124507.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124513.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124503.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124506.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124502.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124501.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124514.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130657.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130658.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124508.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124504.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130659.phy"}]}
