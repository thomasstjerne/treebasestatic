Archinomidae was erected for a single\nspecies, the hydrothermal vent polychaete Archinome rosacea. Originally,\nA. rosacea was assigned to Euphrosinidae although it shares more\nmorphological similarities with Amphinomidae. In this study we assess\nthe position of Archinome, Euphrosinidae and Amphinomidae by using\nmolecular data from nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA. Parsimony and\nBayesian analyses are performed on the nucleotide datasets covering in\ntotal 19 terminal taxa from Amphinomidae, Euphrosinidae, Archinomidae\nand outgroups. Our results conclusively show that Euphrosinidae and\nAmphinomidae are sister taxa, that Archinome has a sister group within\nAmphinomidae and, accordingly, that the family name Archinomidae is a\njunior synonym of Amphinomidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amphinomida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2899.phy"}]}
