During the\nOligocene period (26 - 38 mya) there was a significant reduction in the\nlandmass of New Zealand However, whether or not New Zealand was\ncompletely submerged is a matter of controversy and recent debate. If it\nwas completely submerged during the Oligocene, then all extant biota\nmust have arrived by transoceanic distance dispersal since that time.\nThis study reports molecular systematic and molecular clock analyses\nbased on 3011 base pairs of sequence data (matK and rbcL coding regions,\ntrnD-trnT intergenic region) from the chloroplast genome of nine\ndifferent species from the Araucariaceae family. Analyses of these data\nsuggest that Australian and New Zealand Agathis lineages diverged in the\nlate Cretaceous/early Tertiary period. These estimates are consistent\nwith in situ survival of the Agathis australis lineage in New Zealand\nfollowing the breakup of Gondwana. They imply the continuous existence\nof land in the New Zealand area throughout the Tertiary.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Araucariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1029.phy"}]}
