The five new fungal species are\ndescribed based on morphological characteristics and DNA sequences of\nSSU, ITS, LSU, MCM7, RPB1 and TEF1 genes. The 6-locus phylogeny\nindicates that Pseudophialophora species form a monophyletic clade in\nMagnaporthaceae of Magnaporthales. A key for all described species in\nPseudophialophora is provided, including these five and three previously\npublished species. Distinctions among the new species and other related\nspecies are discussed. The plant-fungal interaction experiment indicates\nthat P. angusta, P. eragrostis, P. magnispora, P. schzachyrii, P. tarda\nand P. whartonensis have negative effects on the growth of switchgrass.\nRunner hyphae were observed from the inoculated switchgrass roots, which\nare typical structures of root-infecting pathogens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudophialophora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85818.phy"}]}
