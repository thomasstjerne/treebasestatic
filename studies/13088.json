With a total length of 290 mm, the present specimen\nrepresents one of the smallest skulls known for this species. Not\nsurprisingly, it shows various characteristics common to juvenile\ntyrannosaurids, such as the rostral margin of the maxillary fenestra not\nreaching that of the external antorbital fenestra and the postorbital\nlacking the cornual process. The nasal bears a small lacrimal process,\nwhich disappears in adults. Lacking some of the morphological\ncharacteristics that are adapted for bearing great feeding forces in\nadult individuals, this juvenile specimen suggests that T. bataar would\nhave changed its dietary niches during ontogeny. The numbers of alveoli\nin the maxilla (13) and dentary (14 and 15) are the same as those in\nadults, suggesting that they do not change ontogenetically in T. bataar\nand is not consistent with the hypothesis that the numbers of alveoli\ndecreases ontogenetically in tyrannosaurids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tyrannosauridae results","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tyrannosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55427.phy"}]}
