We\nconfirmed their teleomorph-anamorph relationships and revealed that\nthese four species have Hirsutella-like anamorphs with differences in\nmorphology between them. By analyzing their molecular phylogeny inferred\nfrom DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large\nsubunit (LSU) D1/D2 region of rDNA, they were separated into four\nclose-knit clades. Although C. prolifica and O. ryogamiensis formed\ntheir own clades, isolates of C. cuboidea separated into two clades,\ni.e., true C. cuboidea clade and a resembling new species, O.\nparacuboidea clade. The latter two species are distinguished by the\nfruiting region of the stroma. In addition, C. alboperitheciata is\nregarded as a synonym of C. cuboidea. These species should be assigned\nto the genus Ophiocordyceps.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cordyceps sensu lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6484.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cordyceps cuboidea group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6656.phy"}]}
