Pythium rishiriense differed morphologically\nfrom other Pythium species by its filamentous, slightly inflated\nsporangia, smooth oogonia which occasionally were produced in chains,\nhypogynous antheridia, and mostly aplerotic oospores. Pythium alternatum\ndiffered morphologically from other Pythium species by its globose\nsporangia, smooth oogonia which produced alternately with antheridia in\nchains, and hypogynous antheridia. Pythium rishiriense is a fast\ngrowing, high temperature-loving species, while P. alternatum is a slow\ngrowing species. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed\nspacer region and cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene sequences showed that\nthese two species are clearly separate from morphologically similar\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium rishiriense and P. alternatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80070.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium rishiriense and P. alternatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80071.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium rishiriense and P. alternatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80069.phy"}]}
