To\nre-evaluate this, a worldwide collection of 117 isolates assigned to\neither P. cryptogea or P. drechsleri or their sister taxon, P.\nerythroseptica were assessed for morphological, physiological\n(pathological, cultural, temperature relations, mating) and molecular\ntraits. Multiple gene phylogeny analysis was performed on DNA sequences\nof nuclear (internal transcribed spacers (ITS), β-tubulin, translation\nelongation factor 1α, elicitin) and mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase\nsubunit I) genes. Congruence was observed between the different\nphylogenetic data sets and established that P. drechsleri and P.\ncryptogea are distinct species. Isolates of P. drechsleri form a\nmonophyletic grouping with low levels of intraspecific diversity whereas\nP. cryptogea is more variable. Three distinct phylogenetic groups were\nnoted within P. cryptogea with isolates forming intermediate groups\nproviding strong evidence for subsequent introgression of previously\nisolated lineages. This evidence suggests that P. cryptogea is an\noperational taxonomic unit and should remain a single species. Of all\nthe morphological and physiological traits only growth rate at higher\ntemperatures reliably discriminated isolates of P. drechsleri and P.\ncryptogea. As a homothallic taxa, P. erythroseptica is clearly different\nin mating behaviour from the other two species. Pathogenicity, however,\nwas not a reliable characteristic as all isolates of the three species\nformed pink rot in potato tubers. The phylogenetic evidence suggests P.\nerythroseptica has evolved from P. cryptogea more recently than the\nsplit from the most recent common ancestor of all three species. However\nmore data and more isolates of authentic P. erythroseptica are needed to\nfully evaluate the taxonomic position of this species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7a","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, Elicitin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6889.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7c","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6952.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6b","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, Beta\nTubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6704.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, All\nPhytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6793.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6c","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, ef1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6806.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7b","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora cryptogea and P. drechsleri, COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6788.phy"}]}
