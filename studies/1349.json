In angiosperms, despite recent\nprogress at the ordinal level, many relationships between families\nremain unclear. Here we take a case study from Lamiales, an angiosperm\norder in which interfamilial relationships have so far proved\nparticularly problematic. We analyse the effect of changing one factor ˆ\nthe quantity of sequence data analysed ˆ on phylogeny reconstruction in\nthis group. We use simulation to estimate a priori the sequence data\nthat would be needed to resolve an accurate, supported phylogeny of\nLamiales. We investigate the effect of increasing the length of sequence\ndata analysed, the rate of substitution in the sequences used, and of\ncombining gene partitions. This method could be a valuable technique for\nplanning systematic investigations in other problematic groups. Our\nresults suggest that increasing sequence length is a better way to\nimprove support, resolution and accuracy than employing sequences with a\nfaster substitution rate. Indeed the latter may in some cases have\ndetrimental effects on phylogeny reconstruction. Further molecular\nsequencing ˆ of at least 10,000 bp ˆ should result in a fully-resolved\nand supported phylogeny of Lamiales, but at present the problematic\naspects of this tree model remain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lamiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4478.phy"}]}
