The new specimen shows two autapomorphies of\nPsittacosaurus major, the transversely narrow dorsal skull roof and very\nprominent dentary flanges, confirming the presence of two large-skulled\npsittacosaur species in the Lujiatun Bed of the Lower Cretaceous Yixian\nFormation in Beipiao City, western Liaoning Province, China, the long-\nand narrow-skulled P. major, and broad-skulled P. lujiatunensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psittacosaurs phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56307.phy"}]}
