Maximum parsimony (PAUP) and\nBayesian (MrBayes) analyses of ITS and combined ITS and matK data reveal\ntwo robustly supported monophyletic North American clades derived from\nAsian ancestors. Biogeographic analysis (S-DIVA) suggests Asia plus\nJapan, the Cascade Range, or Rocky Mountains as highly probable\nancestral areas without involving Beringia for one clade. In the other\nclade, Asia plus the Rocky Mountains is specified as the most probable\nancestral area, but less probable alternatives also include Asia plus\nEurope, Japan, or Beringia. Once established in North America,\ndispersal/divergence throughout North America occurs out of Rocky\nMountain and/or Cascade Range ancestral centers of distribution.\nBeringian and European species are derived from North America centers\nrather than being part of ancestral areas to North American\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedicularis ITS MP Strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedicularis ITS & matK MP Strict","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76917.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedicularis ITS Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76914.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedicularis ITS & matK Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76916.phy"}]}
