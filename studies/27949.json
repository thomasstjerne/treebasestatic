Unlike the continental island of\nTrinidad, the more northerly Tobago was formed as an oceanic island.\nTheir reptile biodiversity reflects colonization events from the South\nAmerican mainland through land bridge connections at times of glacial\nmaxima. Most Tobago´s herpetofauna has colonized through stepping-stone\nevents from Trinidad. However, the enigmatic presence of a rare and\npoorly known fossorial snake in Tobago, in Western Venezuela and\nColombia, but absent in Trinidad and Eastern Venezuela, raises\ninteresting questions regarding its biogeography, mode and timing of\ncolonization of the island. Here we sequence for the first time three\nindividuals from Western Venezuela and one from Tobago and include them\nin the largest phylogeny of Atractus to date. We validate the monophyly\nof the species based on morphology and molecular data, with an\nunexpected low genetic divergence between island and mainland specimens.\nDespite more than 1000 km separating them; our time tree indicates a\nmean 500,000 year divergence. We examine alternative scenarios to\nexplain the biogeography and conclude on an ancient corridor of coastal\nland bridges at times of very low (>100 m) sea level falls that\nconnected Venezuela to Tobago.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"124","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Atractus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133086.phy"}]}
