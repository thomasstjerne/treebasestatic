In particular, avians have proportionally longer and more\nrobust forelimbs that are capable of supporting a large aerodynamic\nsurface. Here we report on a new maniraptoran dinosaur, Anchiornis\nhuxleyi gen. et sp. nov., based on a specimen collected from lacustrine\ndeposits of uncertain age in western Liaoning, China. With an estimated\nmass of 110 grams, Anchiornis is the smallest known non-avian theropod\ndinosaur. It exhibits some wrist features indicative of high mobility,\npresaging the wing-folding mechanisms seen in more derived birds and\nsuggesting rapid evolution of the carpus. Otherwise, Anchiornis is\nintermediate in general morphology between non-avian and avian\ndinosaurs, particularly with regard to relative forelimb length and\nthickness, and represents a transitional step toward the avian\ncondition. In contrast with some recent comprehensive phylogenetic\nanalyses, our phylogenetic analysis incorporates subtle morphological\nvariations and recovers a conventional result supporting the monophyly\nof Avialae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5-B","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Avialae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56081.phy"}]}
