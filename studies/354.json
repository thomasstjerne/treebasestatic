Despite extensive work on the biology of\nXrnopus from various disciplines, the evolutionary relationships of\nXenopus to other pipids have not been resolved. Phylogenetic analyis of\nmorphological features of pipid frogs indicates that, contrary to\nearlier opinions, Hymenochirus and Pipa are closest relatives\n(sister-groups); these genera are placed in the subfamily Pipinae. Also,\nthe currently recognized species of Xenopus do not form a natural group;\nthe species tropicalis and epitropicalis are more closely related to\nHymenochirus + Pipa than to the remaining species of Xenopus. The two\ndiscordant species are transferred to the genus Silurana, which is\nrelegated to the new subfamily Siluraninae; it is the sister-group of\nthe Pipinae. The remaining species of Xenopus constitute a monophyletic\ngroup that is placed in the subfamily Xenopodinae as th","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pipidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5503.phy"}]}
