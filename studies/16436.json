Phylogenetics unambiguously\nidentify strains BRL/SF as a novel taxonomic unit distinct from C.\nmellificae strains 30254/30862 and assign all four strains as lineages\nof a novel clade within the subfamily Leishmaniinae. In vivo analyses\nshow strains BRL/SF preferably colonize the hindgut, lining the lumen as\nadherent spheroids in a manner identical to previous descriptions from\nC. mellificae. Microscopy images show motile forms of C. mellificae are\ndistinct from strains BRL/SF. We propose the binomial Lotmaria passim\nn. gen., n. sp. for this previously undescribed taxon. Analyses of new\nand previously accessioned genetic data show C. mellificae is still\nextant in bee populations, however L. passim n. gen., n. sp. is\ncurrently the predominant trypanosomatid in A. mellifera globally. Our\nfindings require that previous reports of C. mellificae be reconsidered\nand that subsequent trypanosomatid species designations from Hymenoptera\nprovide genetic support.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cytb NJT","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trypanosomatid Cytb NJ tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80847.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cytb MLT","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trypanosomatid Cytb ML tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80846.phy"},{"tree_label":"gGAPDH+SSU MLT","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trypanosomatid gGAPDH+SSU ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80848.phy"},{"tree_label":"gGAPDH+SSU NJT","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trypanosomatid gGAPDH+SSU NJ tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_80849.phy"}]}
