These mycocinogenic\nstrains were studied by molecular methods to verify their phylogenetic\nrelationships. Based on the combined analysis of LSU and ITS sequence\ndata, these strains were confirmed to belong to C. laurentii.\nAdditionally, this study provides several DNA-barcodes (LSU, ITS and\nRPB1) for this species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptococcus laurentii Maximum Likelihood based on ITS\nand LSU sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53034.phy"}]}
