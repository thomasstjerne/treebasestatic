In this paper, one\nnew species of Cucurbitaria is described based on a polyphasic approach,\nincluding morphological examination and molecular phylogeny. We compared\nthe sexual morph (ascomata, asci, and ascospores) of the specimens\ncollected with known species of Cucurbitaria and carried out multi loci\n(LSU, ITS, rpb2 and tef1-α) phylogenetic analyses. Cucurbitaria\nberberidicola sp. nov. is morphologically closely related to\nCucurbitaria berberidis (the generic type) and C. oromediterranea. The\nsequence-based analyses verified a clear distinction, hence supporting\nthe introduction of the new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucurbitaria berberidicola RPB2M","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135418.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucurbitaria berberidicola TEFM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135419.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucurbitaria berberidicola ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135417.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucurbitaria berberidicola LSUM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135420.phy"}]}
