(Asteraceae) collected from the\nRostov Region of Russia. The new taxon shares with D. mariae, the type\nspecies of Dematiopleospora, features such as unilocular ascomata, with\nbrown setae in the ostiole, cylindrical asci and fusiform, muriform\nascospores. However, D. fusiformis differs morphologically from the type\nand other species in Dematiopleospora in having larger asci and\nascospores. Phylogenetic analyses of combined ITS, SSU and LSU sequence\ndata also placed this species in Dematiopleospora. Maximum likelihood\nand Bayesian inference analyses revealed it to group closely with\nDematiopleospora mariae and D. cirsii, but to be a distinct species. The\nnew species, is introduced with a comprehensive description and\nmicrophotographs and is compared with the most similar species in the\ngenus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dematioplespora fusiformis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107862.phy"}]}
