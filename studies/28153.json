The new species is\ndistinguishable from Aspicilia aquatica (Fr.) KÃ¶rb., the most similar\nspecies, by pale gray areolate thallus, absence of prothallus, black\ndisc without green color in water, olive-brown epihymenium, shorter\nhymenium, hymenium I+ yellowish blue-green, wider paraphysial tips\nwithout a vivid pigment, smaller asci, smaller ascospores, and the\npresence of stictic acid. Molecular analyses employing internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) and mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU)\nsequences strongly support Aspicilia humida as a distinct species in the\ngenus Aspicilia. A surrogate key is provided to assist in the\nidentification of all 28 taxa in Aspicilia of Korea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for ML","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspicilia ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspicilia ITS Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for Bayesian inference","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspicilia mtSSU Bayesian inference","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 for ML","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspicilia mtSSU ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_130688.phy"}]}
