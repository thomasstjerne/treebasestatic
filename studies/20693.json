Endocarpon\nthalli are squamulose to subfruticose, whereas Willeya and Staurothele\ninclude only crustose species. Endocarpon pulvinatum, an arctic-alpine\nspecies newly reported for Iceland, is one of the few Endocarpon with a\nsubfruticose thallus formed by long and narrow erected squamules.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses of four loci (ITS, nrLSU, mtSSU, and\nmcm7) newly obtained from E. pulvinatum specimens from Iceland, Finland\nand North America does not confirm its current classification within the\nmostly squamulose genus Endocarpon, but instead supports its placement\nwithin the crustose genus Staurothele. The new combination Staurothele\npulvinata is therefore proposed here. It includes also E. tortuosum,\nwhich was confirmed as a synonym of E. pulvinatum based on a single\nsequence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU unrooted","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endocarpon pulvinatum within Staurothele","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102686.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endocarpon pulvinatum within Staurothele","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102685.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS unrooted","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endocarpon pulvinatum within Staurothele","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102687.phy"}]}
