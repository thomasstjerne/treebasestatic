This mycoparasite was found in June growing on\nbasidiomata of Kuehneromyces lignicola. It was fruiting on wooden\nremnants in a mixed montane Picea-Abies forest. The new agaric closely\nresembles Squamanita fimbriata macroscopically, but it differs\nmicroscopically chiefly in the smaller basidiospores, basidia and\nchlamydospores, and somewhat shorter cheilocystidia. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences showed that\nthe new species forms an independent well-supported branch","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109915.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109916.phy"}]}
