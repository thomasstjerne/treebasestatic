This fungus has been known only by the type specimen, and is\nnow regarded as a species of the Erysiphales. However, molecular data\nare still required to verify the taxonomic treatment. In March 2011 we\nrediscovered the fungus at Cibodas Botanical Garden, Java. Detailed\ncharacterizations of this tropical powdery mildew are reported in this\nstudy with both morphological and molecular bases. Anamorph of this\nfungus that was not found in the type specimen is also reported in this\nstudy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystotheca tjibodensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48900.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cystotheca tjibodensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48901.phy"}]}
