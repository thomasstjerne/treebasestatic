We\nassessed the species diversity of Cladorrhinum in Argentina. Strains\nwere identified at the species level by analysis of morphological and\nphysiological characters, as well as using molecular characters, by\nsequencing three nuclear DNA loci: internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS), 28S ribosomal subunit and Î²-tubulin. Ex-type strains and\ntaxonomically established isolates of Cladorrhinum were used as\nreferences. C. bulbillosum and C. samala were detected, and a new\nspecies is described, as C australe","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88958","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88958.phy"}]}
