The fungus produced telia beneath\nthe host epidermis and basidiospores on metabasidia emerging from the\nsori on the abaxial leaf surface. Probasidia were single- celled,\nsessile, short-cylindrical, thin-walled, and laterally free. A\nfour-celled metabasidium arose from a probasidium by apical elongation.\nApparent biotrophic nature and the basidium morphology of the Staphylea\nfungus suggested its taxonomic affinity to the rust genus Ochropsora.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses of D1/D2 region of LSU rDNA showed that\ntwo collections of the fungus were grouped with Ochropsora ariae (type\nspecies of the genus) and O. nambuana but formed an independent clade.\nThe fungus under consideration was, therefore, classified in Ochropsora,\nand a new name, O. staphyleae, was proposed for it.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128371.phy"}]}
