The strains were revealed to belong to C. nymphaeae, C.\nmelonis, C. abscissum and one new species, namely C. paranaense, from\napple and peach. Morphological descriptions of the new species and a\nstrain closely related to but diverging from C. melonis are provided.\nFrom the data presently available, the most common species on apple\nfruits in Brazil is C. nymphaeae. In a pathogenicity test, strains of\nall four species caused lesions on detached apple, peach and guava\nfruits, except for strain CBS 134730 that did not infect guava\nfruits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93219","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93219.phy"}]}
