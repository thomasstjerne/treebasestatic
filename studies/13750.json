In the present study,\nColletotrichum species were isolated from soybean petioles and stems\nwith anthracnose symptoms from soybean fields in Illinois. Multi-gene\nsequence phylogenic analyses, combining rDNA internal transcribed\nspacer, actin, beta-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,\nand histone H3 gene regions, revealed a group of isolates collected in\nthis study to be distinct from other established Colletotrichum species.\nThis new cluster was genetically closer to C. liriopes, C. tofieldiae,\nand C. verruculosum. One isolate from this group was examined closely\nfor its morphology, cultural characteristics, and pathogenicity on\nsoybean. The examined isolate was different from C. truncatum, the most\ncommon pathogen of soybean anthracnose, in features of colony culture\nand in sizes of conidia and appressoria. As a result of the molecular\nphylogenetic, morphological and pathogenicity analyses, we hereby\nintroduce the new Colletotrichum species as Colletotrichum maxi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of Colletotrichum based on 5 gene\nregions","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60048.phy"}]}
