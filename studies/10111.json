Sequences\nfrom the internal transcribed spacer region show that it is distinct\nfrom all 44 species of Suillus tested, and features of its morphology\nseparate it from all other unsequenced species. Suillus quiescens has a\nbroader distribution than Channel Islands and coastal California as it\nwas also encountered as ectomycorrhizae on roots of pine seedlings from\nthe eastern Sierra Nevada, coastal Oregon, and the Southern Cascade\nMountains. The reason it has not been previously identified from these\nareas may be due to its resemblance to S. brevipes at maturity, or it\nmay be a rare fruiter that persists in the spore bank","trees":[{"tree_label":"Generic NJ Tree","ntax":"134","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Broad Suillus set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6527.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Tree","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Suillus granulatus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6098.phy"}]}
