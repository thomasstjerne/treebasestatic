The R. vinicolor species complex by our definition includes, but\nis not limited to, collections referred to as R. vinicolor Smith, R.\ndiabolicus Smith, R. ochraceisporus Smith, R. parvulus Smith or R.\nvesiculosus Smith. Holo- and/or paratype material for the named species\nis included. Analyses of both ITS sequences and microsatellite loci\nseparate collections of the R. vinicolor species complex into two\ndistinct clades or clusters, suggestive of two biological species that\nsubsequently are referred to as R. vinicolor sensu Kretzer et al and R.\nvesiculosus sensu Kretzer et al.Â Choice of the latter names, as well as\nmorphological characters, are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopogon vinicolor species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4059.phy"}]}
