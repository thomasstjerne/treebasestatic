We used a time-calibrated\nphylogenetic tree based on three cpDNA (ndhF, rpl16, trnQ-rps16) and two\nnrDNA (ETS, ITS) regions including all currently accepted species in\nAmorimia for ancestral area reconstructions. Our results show that: (1)\nthe ancestor of Amorimia originated in Atlantic dry forests around 22.0\nMya; (2) ancestors of both Amorimia subgenera arose in southern\nBrazilian dry forests from 18.0 to 14.0 Mya; (3) the remaining lineages\nin the genera diversified from mid-Miocene to the late-Pliocene; and (4)\na history of two expansion events during early and middle Miocene,\nbesides several colonization events in different nuclei of dry forests\nin South America is suggested.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amorimia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113018.phy"}]}
