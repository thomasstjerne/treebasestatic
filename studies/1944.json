Pryor, Casey Culler, Myung Soo Park","Year":" 2007","Title":" A re-examination of the phylogenetic relationship between the\ncausal agents of carrot black rot, Alternaria radicina and A.\ncarotiincultae","Journal":" Mycologia","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" The phylogenetic relationship between Alternaria radicina\nand A. carotiincultae was re-examined based on morphology, sequence\nanalysis of rDNA [ITS and mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU)], protein\ncoding genes [actin (ACT), 짜창-tubulin, chitin synthase (CHS),\ntranslation elongation factor (EF-1a), Alt a1, and\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd)], and RAPD and ISSR\nanalysis of total genomic DNA. Although some morphological characters\noverlapped to a degree, with A. radicina isolates expressing moderate\nvariation and A. carotiincultae isolates being highly uniform, A.\ncarotiincultae could be differentiated from A. radicina based on\nsignificantly greater growth rate on potato dextrose agar (PDA) or\nacidified PDA (APDA) and average number of trasverse septa per conidium.\nSequence of rDNA and two protein coding genes, ACT and CHS, were\ninvariant between species. However, polymorphism with the EF-1a,\n짜창-tubulin, and Alt a1 gene strictly separated the population of A.\nradicina and A. carotiincultae as distinct lineages, as did RAPD and\nISSR analysis. The polymorphic gpd gene did not strictly separate the\ntwo species. However, isolates of A. radicina encompassed several\nhaplotypes, one of which was the exclusive haplotype possessed by A.\ncarotiincultae isolates, suggesting evidence of incomplete lineage\nsorting. The results suggest that A. carotiincultae is very closely\nrelated to A. radicina, but is a recently divergent and distinct\nlineage, which supports its status as a separate species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria radicina and Alternaria carotiincultae, Alt\na1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5004.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria radicina and Alternaria carotiincultae, ef\n1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5002.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria radicina and Alternaria carotiincultae, beta\ntubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria radicina and Alternaria carotiincultae,\ngpd","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5005.phy"}]}
