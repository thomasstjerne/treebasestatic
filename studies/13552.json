Batsch] tree\nmortality attributed to Armillaria root disease was assessed from 2009\nto 2011 in 15 orchards in the State of Mexico, Mexico. Incidence\nincreased gradually every year of assessment, reaching average values of\n9.7, 15.3 and 20.3% tree mortality and 23.2, 24.7 and 28.3%\ndisease-impacted area of the orchards during 2009, 2010 and 2011,\nrespectively. The cultivars âNemaguardâ and âCriollo of La Goletaâ, a\nlocal rootstock used in the region, were both susceptible to the\ndisease. To identify species of Armillaria isolated from infected peach\ntrees, two nuclear rDNA regions (partial 5.8S-ITS2-LSU D-domains and\npartial 3 LSU-IGS1) and the translation elongation factor-1Î± (tef-1Î±)\ngene were sequenced and compared with sequences of known Armillaria\nspecies. DNA sequence analysis from 49 Armillaria isolates revealed that\nfive isolates (10.2%) were Armillaria mellea and eight isolates (16.3%)\nwere Armillaria gallica. DNA sequences from the remaining 36 isolates\n(73.5%) showed no close similarity to Armillaria sequences in GenBank,\nand apparently represent an undescribed Armillaria species. This\nundescribed species was the most widely distributed in the region of\nstudy. Separate phylogenetic analyses of the LSU region (D1 D3 domains\nconcatenated with the partial 3 end) and the tef-1 region show that the\nundescribed species is quite distinct from other Armillaria spp.\nreported in North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria spp. 50% majority-rule bootstrap consensus\ntree generated from LSU (D1-D2-D3 domains and 3’ ends of LSU)\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillaria spp. 50% majority-rule bootstrap consensus\ntree generated from tef-1Î± sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58106.phy"}]}
