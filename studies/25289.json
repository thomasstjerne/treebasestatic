During a survey of\ntaxonomic studies of leaf litter inhabiting fungi resulted in a saprobic\nmember of Dothideomycetes being collected from Dahu forest, Alishan\nMountain, Chiayi in Taiwan (Elevation 656 m). Morphology coupled with\ncombined gene analysis of a LSU, ITS and tef1-α DNA sequence data,\nshowed that it belongs to the family Dictyosporiaceae. A new species,\nPseudocoleophoma zingiberacearum (Zingiberaceae) from dead leaves of\nHedychium coronarium is herein described. Maximum parsimony, maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses were performed to clarify the\nphylogenetic affinities of the species. Pseudocoleophoma zingiberacearum\nis distinguished from the other Pseudocoleophoma species based on\ndistinct size differences in ascomata, asci, ascospores and DNA sequence\ndata. Interestingly, this is the first Pseudocoleophoma species record\nfrom family Zingiberaceae. The new species is compared with other\nPseudocoleophoma species and a comprehensive description and micrographs\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120330.phy"}]}
