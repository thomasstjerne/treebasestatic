The tribe Myrmicini belongs to the subfamily Myrmicinae\nand groups morphologically unspecialised genera. Previous research has\nstruggled with defining Myrmicini, leading to considerable taxonomic\ninstability. Previous molecular studies have suggested non-monophyly of\nMyrmicini but they have been based on limited taxon sampling. We\ninvestigated the composition of Myrmicini with phylogenetic analyses of\nan enlarged set of taxa, using DNA sequences of seven gene fragments\ntaken from representatives of six of the seven genera (Eutetramorium,\nHuberia, Hylomyrma, Myrmica, Manica and Pogonomyrmex). Our results\ndemonstrate the invalidity of Myrmicini as currently defined. We\nrecovered sister-group relationships between the genera Myrmica and\nManica, and between Pogonomyrmex and Hylomyrma. This study illustrates\nthat to understand the phylogeny of over 6000 myrmicine species,\ncomprehensive taxon sampling and DNA sequencing are an absolute\nrequisite","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tribe Myrmicini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6281.phy"}]}
