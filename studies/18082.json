Carebara elmenteitae (Patrizi) is known from\nonly a single phragmotic major worker collected from sifted leaf-litter\nnear Lake Elmenteita in Kenya, but here we study and compare the worker\ncastes of two species collected from Kakamega Forest, a small rainforest\nin Western Kenya, which were previously identified as Carebara\nelmenteitae (phragmotic major workers) and non-phragmotic major and\nminor workers of C. thoracica (Weber). Using evidence of both\nmorphological and next-generation sequencing analysis, we show that\nphragmotic and non-phragmotic workers of the two different species are\nactually the same and that neither name  C. elmenteitae or C. thoracica \ncorrectly applies to them. Instead, this and another closey related\nspecies from Ivory Coast are both morphologically different from C.\nelmenteitae, and thus we describe them as the new species Carebara\nphragmotica sp. n. and Carebara lilith sp. n.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89480","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89480.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89479","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89479.phy"}]}
