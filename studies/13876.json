Maximum parsimony\nand maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated data matrix of 7,212\naligned nucleotides provided excellent bootstrap support for many\nclades. Concordant with prior molecular results Pseudorlaya pumila was\nfirmly imbedded within Daucus, as was Margottia gummifera, a new\nfinding. All accessions of D. capillifolius, D. carota, and D.\nsahariensis formed a 2n = 18 clade with all other species within the\nDaucus clade with chromosome numbers of = 20, 22, and 44 (D.\nglochidiatus). Sister to the D. carota clade was a clade containing\nMargottia gummifera and Pseudorlaya pumila, sister to these species was\nD. crinitus, sister to all the above was D. muricatus, and sister to all\nof the above was a clade containing the remaining Daucus species.\nBayesian analyses of individual regions analyzed separately and averaged\nover multiple trees with *BEAST software (a coalescent approach),\nhowever, provided a phylogeny at variance with the concatenated\napproach, most notably in firmly imbedding Turgenia latifolia within\nDaucus. Our research highlights the need for additional morphological\nand molecular studies in preparation for a modern taxonomic monograph of\nDaucus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Daucususe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60728.phy"}]}
