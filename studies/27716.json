Specimens\nwere collected from Honshu (Gunma, Ibaraki, Nagano, Tochigi Prefectures)\nand Amami-Oshima Island (Kagoshima Prefecture) and they were identified\nbased on morphological observation and phylogenetic analyses using the\nnuclear large subunit rDNA region. Among the four species, one was a\nnon-bryophilous taxon, Leucoscypha leucotricha, which was found growing\non the ground of montane broad-leaved or mixed forests in Gunma and\nNagano Prefectures. The other three species were bryophilous taxa:\nNeottiella albocincta was found on Atrichum undulatum in Tochigi\nPrefecture, Octospora ithacaensis was found on Marchantia polymorpha\nsubsp. ruderalis in Ibaraki and Nagano Prefectures, and Octosporopsis\nerinacea was found on Dumortiera hirsuta subsp. hirsuta on Amami-Oshima\nIsland. This is the second record of O. erinacea after the original\nspecies description from Borneo.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129134","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129134.phy"}]}
