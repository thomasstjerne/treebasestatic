Phylogenetic analyses based on the LSU and ITS regions reveal\nthat Elmerina was a polyphyletic genus. Moreover, E. hexagonoides\ncollected from Malaysia and âE. hexagonoidesâ from Japan formed two\ndistinct clades within a well-supported larger clade with Protomerulius\ncaryae. These taxa comprise a different lineage from the type species of\nboth Protomerulius and Protodaedalea, and we conclude that they are\nmembers of the genus Aporpium. The phylogenetic position of E.\ncladophora (type species of Elmerina) is still unclear, and we retain\nAporpium and Protodaedalea as genera distinct from Elmerina. Aporpium\nstrigosum sp. nov. is described to represent Japanese specimens\nmisidentified as E. hexagonoides. Aporpium is characterized by\nresupinate to sessile basidiocarps, tough-fleshy to leathery context,\nporoid hymenophore, dimitic hyphal systems with unbranched skeletal\nhyphae, clavate to pyriform probasidia, and ellipsoid to cylindrical or\nallantoid basidiospores. Aporpium strigosum is similar to A.\nhexagonoides but can be differentiated by the ochraceous to\nstraw-colored basidiocarps, strigose pileus surface with long and stiff\nhairs, and the larger pores , basidia, and basidiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP2(LSU+ITS)","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70715.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP2(LSU)","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70697.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP1(LSU)","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70696.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP1(LSU+ITS)","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70714.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP3(LSU)","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70698.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML(LSU) Fig1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70700.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP4(LSU)","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70699.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML(LSU+ITS) Fig2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70718.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP3(LSU+ITS)","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70716.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP4(LSU+ITS)","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auriculariales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70717.phy"}]}
