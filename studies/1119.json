Collections from\nPuerto Rico, Mexico, and Costa Rica did not differ morphologically, but\ntheir monokaryotic cultures revealed the existence of three\ninterINcompatibility groups. These putative cryptic species exist\nsympatrically in Costa Rica. Sequencing, restriction enzyme digestion,\nand specific primers targeting the ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA\n(ITS I - 5.8S - ITS II) could only partly be used for detecting\nintercompatibility groups. Heterogeneity within the rDNA repeat was\nobserved. Molecular evidence supports the existence of a close relative\nin Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5, MEGA-NJBOOT","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_218.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5, SEPAL-MP","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1734.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5, MEGA-NJIB","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5, MEGA-ME","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1730.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 6R MR80FaststepJack","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 6R MR50TBR10 4817","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1732.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 6L BEST OF 100","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus tricholoma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1733.phy"}]}
