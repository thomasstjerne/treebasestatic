This\nspecies was initially identified as F. acuminatum employing\nmorphological data; however, it differs from this species in that it\nproduces longer macroconidia in which the apical cell is not as pointed,\nchlamydospores are not produced, and its colony growth rate on agar is\nmuch faster. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of portions of 13 genes\nresolved F. praegraminearum as the basal most species within the B\nclade. Mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that it was able to produce\n4-acetylnivalenol and 4,15-acetyl nivalenol, the nontrichothecene\nsesquiterpenes culmorin and hydroxy-culmorins, and the estrogen\nzearalenone in vitro. Results of a pathogenicity experiment revealed\nthat F. praegraminearum was able to induce moderate head blight on\nwheat.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fusarium","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96423","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fusarium","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96422","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96422.phy"}]}
