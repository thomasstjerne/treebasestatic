In order to clarify some of the uncertainties of\ngeneric delimitation and classification of the group and test its\nmonophyly, morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses based on\nITS-5.8S, LSU, TEF-1α were carried out. The main outcomes of the study\nare: (i) although monophyletic the family should be treated as a synonym\nof Polyporaceae; (ii) Amaurodermellus is proposed to accommodate a\nNeotropical species with ovoid spores previously classified in\nAmauroderma (A.ovisporum); (iii) Leucoganoderma is proposed to\naccommodate the species with pale context and truncate basidiospores\nwith endosporic ornamentation as ridges (Ganoderma coffeatum and G.\nflaviporum). Moreover, comments on other noteworthy species are also\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121030","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121030.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121031","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121031.phy"}]}
