After further morphological studies, between 1919\nand 2011, it remained among the basidiomycetes, most recently as\nincertae sedis in the order Cryptobasidiales. Our studies, based on\nlight and scanning electron microscopy, supported by multilocus\nphylogenetic analysessecond-largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2),\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), small subunit (18S), large\nsubunit (28S), and nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2\n= ITS) of the nuclear rDNA sequences, and mitochondrial rDNA small\nsubunit (mtSSU)finally determined the phylogenetic placement of\nCladosterigma as the first nonlichenicolous mycoparasitic member of the\nGomphillaceae within the Graphidales, an ascomycete order previously\ncomposed predominantly of lichen-forming fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanoromycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129100.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Graphidales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129101.phy"}]}
