These genera have capitate-stipitate stromata that gradually\nexpand into a vertically flattened fruiting head with strongly\nprotruding perithecia, dark in color, and with eight multiseptate\nfiliform ascospores that disarticulate at the middle septum to form two\nlanceolate multiseptate part-ascospores. In this study, several\nspecimens of the above mentioned species, including the types, were\nexamined in order to determine if they were congeneric with Podocrella.\nIn addition, this study reveals the connection of Podocrella to its\nanamorph genus, Harposporium, and its relationship to several other\nclavicipitaceous genera, based on morphological data and large subunit\nnuclear ribosomal DNA (LSU) sequences. The results show that Podocrella\nand selected Harposporium LSU sequences form a monophyletic group and\nthat this clade is closely related to Aschersonia. A new species of\nPodocrella from Costa Rica, P. fusca, is described and a key to the\nknown species is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podocrella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1842.phy"}]}
