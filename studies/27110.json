Sixty-eight isolates were identified\nas R. solani and ten isolates as binucleate Rhizoctonia. The most\nprevalent AG was AG-4-HGI (83.3% of isolates), followed by AG-A (7.7%),\nAG-1-IB (2.6%), AG-G (2.6%), AG-R (2.6%), and AG-2-2IIIB (1.3%).\nAG-4-HGI was found in all regions of brassicas collection in Brazil.\nIsolates from all AGs, with the exception of AG-A, induced symptoms in\ndetached leaves of kale. AG-4 HGI and AG-2-2IIB isolates were\nsignificantly more aggressive. This study was the first report of the\noccurrence of AG-4-HGI, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-A, AG-G and AG-R infecting\nbrassica plants in Brazil. Knowledge of these anastomosis groups is\nextremely important for understanding the epidemiology of the disease\nand forward development of management strategies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126728","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126728.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126729","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126729.phy"}]}
