Molecular phylogenies of the tribe Coreopsideae (including only\ntwo species of Heterosperma) pointed out that the genus would be not\nmonophyletic. We performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis including\nseven species of Heterosperma and related taxa, using plastid and\nnuclear sequences. The results indicated that Heterosperma is\nmonophyletic if Coreopsis cyclocarpa is included in the genus, so the\nnew combination Heterosperma cyclocarpum is proposed. Morphological\nanalysis of the floral trichomes, pappus and cypselae, and a comparative\ntable of these morphological features are presented. a A key to related\ngenera, and distribution maps are also provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t5","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110394.phy"},{"tree_label":"t2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110391.phy"},{"tree_label":"t6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110395.phy"},{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110390.phy"},{"tree_label":"t3","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110392.phy"},{"tree_label":"t4","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110393.phy"},{"tree_label":"t7","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110396.phy"},{"tree_label":"t8","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heterosperma ITS + trnL-trnF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110397.phy"}]}
