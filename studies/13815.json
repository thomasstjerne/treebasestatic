Notably, the coexistence of host species\ncompeting with each other, which is expected to be stabilized by their\necological differences, could be facilitated by differences in their\nendosymbionts. Yet, the composition of endosymbiotic communities housed\nby natural communities of competing host species is still almost\nunknown. In this study, we started filling this gap by describing and\ncomparing the bacterial endosymbiotic communities of four sibling weevil\nspecies (Curculio spp.) that compete with each other to lay eggs into\noak acorns (Quercus spp.) and exhibit marked ecological differences.\nResults: All four species housed the primary endosymbiont Candidatus\nCurculioniphilus buchneri, yet each of these had a clearly distinct\ncommunity of secondary endosymbionts, including Rickettsia, Spiroplasma,\nand two Wolbachia strains. Notably, three weevil species harbored their\nown predominant facultative endosymbiont and possessed the remaining\nsymbionts at a residual infection level. Conclusions: The four competing\nspecies clearly harbor distinct endosymbiotic communities. We discuss\nhow such endosymbiotic communities could spread and keep distinct in the\nfour insect species, and how these symbionts might affect the\norganization and species richness of host communities.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Rickettsia Tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60474","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60474.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Spiroplasma Tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60481","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60481.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Spiroplasma Tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60482","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60482.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Curculio COI Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Rickettsia Tree","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60475","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60475.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Cbuchneri GroEL Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60469.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Cbuchneri 16S Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60479","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60479.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes Cbuchneri 16S Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60480","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60480.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes Cbuchneri GroEL Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60468.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Curculio COI Tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60471.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Wolbachia tree","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60476","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60476.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Wolbachia Tree","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60477","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60477.phy"}]}
