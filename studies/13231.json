Among the four discoverd\nspecimens of this new armored dinosaur that best preserved is the most\ncomplete ankylosaur presently known from the Upper Cretaceous of Europe.\nAlthough many cranial characters of Hungarosaurus are not determinable,\na preliminary phylogenetic analysis places Hungarosaurus in the\nNodosauridae as a basal nodosaurid. Hungarosaurus is clearly\ndistinguishable from Struthiosaurus on the basis of the dorsoventrally\nwide quadratojugal, the presence of bony protuberances on the\nquadratojugal and postorbital, the robust mandibular quadrate condyle,\nand the interpterygoid vacuity. The analysis suggests that Hungarosaurus\nappears to be more derived than Struthiosaurus, but more primitive than\nthe North American Silvisaurus, Sauropelta, and Pawpawsaurus","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 15","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ankylosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55983.phy"}]}
