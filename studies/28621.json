This new species is morphologically characterized by\nits shape and dimension of conidia and colonies on PDA and MEA.\nMulti-gene phylogenetic analysis based on a four-gene dataset consisting\nof the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) region and 28S (LSU) of the ribosomal DNA,\npartial DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit (rpb2) and transcription\nelongation factor 1 alpha (tef1) supported the placement of A.\nlongispora in the genus Arxiella as a new species. A. longispora showed\ncellulolytic activities and wheat bran and peptone were optimal carbo A.\nlongispora n and nitrogen sources for the cellulolytic activities, in\nparticular CMCase, Avicelase and Î²-glucosidase activities, of A.\nlongispora, respectively. Crude extracts of A. longispora showed an\nactivity against Rhizoctonia solani CCTCC AF 2021031, which is the first\nreported antifungal activity of Arxiella species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132692","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132692.phy"}]}
