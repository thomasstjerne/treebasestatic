Although species-poor\ncompared to its sister group, Pentagramma encompasses a diverse array of\nmorphotypes, cytotypes, and flavonoid chemotypes. Because the\ndifferences are generally cryptic, however, the various entities are\nusually recognized at an infraspecific level. In recent years, as many\nas five subspecies have been ascribed to P. triangularis, and only P.\npallida has been considered sufficiently divergent to warrant\nrecognition as a distinct species. In this study, we take a unified\napproach to taxonomic delimitation in Pentagramma. Combining spore\nstudies with phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear sequences, we\nidentify six genetically and morphologically distinct diploid lineages,\neach of which is here treated as a species. A new species is described\n(P. glanduloviscida) and two new combinations are made (P. maxonii and\nP. rebmanii).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_80037.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 59","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr80038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_80038.phy"}]}
