Skinnera) defined by blue pollen and the presence of flavones in\nall species. Data on foliar flavonoid compounds in the section were\nreanalyzed, and additional nonflavonoid characters were employed to make\na phylogenetic reevaluation of the group, using the rest of the genus as\nthe outgroup. Of 17 characters used, 7 were phylogenetically\ninformative, resulting in two equally most parsimonious cladograms 23\nsteps long. Both have a consistency index of 0.75 when all\nnoninformative characters are excluded. The two trees differ in the\nposition of the Tahitian F. cyrtandroides and the New Zealand F.\nprocumbens, each of which appears as the sister group of the other\nspecies in the respective cladograms. In both trees, F. excorticata and\nF. perscandens form a clade defined by constricted floral tubes. These\nresults differ from a prior cladistic analysis of the section based\nprimarily on flavonoids, which placed F. cyrtandroides unambiguously as\nthe sister species of the rest of the section and grouped F. procumbens\nin a clade with F. perscandens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuchsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fuchsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1675.phy"}]}
