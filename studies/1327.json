The genera\nHemiphacidium (I-) and Sarcotrochila (I+) have been differentiated based\non the reaction despite a high degree of morphological and ecological\nsimilarity, while in the genus Rhabdocline, the iodine reaction has been\nused to differentiate species and circumscribe subspecies. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses indicate that currently recognized subspecies of\nR. weirii are non-monophyletic while those of R. pseudotsugae form\ndistinct sister lineages. The polyphyly of R. weirii suggests that the\npresence or absence of an I+ ascus pore is not a good predictor of\nspecies circumscriptions. To de-emphasize the importance of the iodine\nreaction in classification within Hemiphacidiaceae and to promulgate a\nclassification more consistent with relationships revealed by molecular\nphylogenetics, we propose that Hemiphacidium be synonymized under\nSarcotrochila and that subspecies of Rhabdocline pseudotsugae and R.\nweirii be raised to species rank. The following new combinations are\nproposed: Sarcotrochila longispora, S. plana, S. convexa, Rhabdocline\noblonga, R. obovata, and R. epiphylla.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhabdocline","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_305.phy"}]}
