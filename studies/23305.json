Crassiperidium is characterized by globose\nto depressed globose ascomata with a well-developed ascomatal wall at\nthe sides, clavate asci, broadly fusiform, hyaline ascospores, pycnidial\nconidiomata, and cylindrical, multi-septate, hyaline conidia produced by\nannellidic conidiogenous cells. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined\ndataset of SSU and LSU nrDNA, and RPB2 revealed that Crassiperidium is\nclose to Cyclothyriellaceae (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes), but its\nfamilial placement was unresolved. The two new species of Crassiperidium\nhave similar-sized ascospores and conidia, but the asci are 8-spored in\nC. octosporum and 4-spored in C. quadrisporum. Phylogenetic analyses of\nCrassiperidium species based on the sequences of ITS, TEF1, RPB2, and a\ncombined dataset of these three loci support the validity of these two\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crassiperidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115758.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crassiperidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115756.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MLT","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crassiperidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MLT","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crassiperidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115755.phy"}]}
