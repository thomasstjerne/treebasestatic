(Commelinaceae)\nsheds light on a new infrageneric classification and taxonomic novelties\nin subtribe Tradescantiinae","Journal":" Phytokeys","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Commelinaceae, Tradescantia, Gibasis, Elasis, Callisia,\nTripogandra, Tradescantiinae","DOI":"","Abstract":" Throughout the years, three infrageneric classifications\nwere proposed for Tradescantia along with several informal groups and\nspecies complexes. The current infrageneric classification accepts 12\nsections  with T. sect. Tradescantia being further divided into four\nseries , and assimilates many concepts adopted by previous authors.\nRecent molecular-based phylogenetic studies indicate that the currently\naccepted sections might not represent monophyletic lineages within\nTradescantia. Based on newly gathered morphological data on the group,\ncomplemented with available micromorphological, cytological and\nphytochemical data, we present the first morphological based\nevolutionary hypothesis for Tradescantia. Furthermore, we reduced\nsubtribe Thyrsantheminae to a synonym of subtribe Tradescantiinae, and\npropose a new infrageneric classification for Tradescantia, based on the\ntotal evidence of our morphological phylogeny, combined to the\npreviously published molecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Adams","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105990.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105989.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tradescantia 5S Fig2F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105988.phy"}]}
