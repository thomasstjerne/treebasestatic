We use a\nmultiple DNA marker-based phylogeny to reconstruct for the first time\nthe evolution of dwarf male morphology, their settlement position and\nthe sexual system in thoracican barnacles. Our taxon sampling comprised\nspecies with diverse sexual systems and dwarf male morphologies and was\nespecially rich in the rare deep-sea Scalpelliformes. The ancestral\nthoracican barnacle may have had dwarf males as in the basally diverging\nIbliformes. But the males were subsequently lost and then evolved again\nat least five times from purely hermaphroditic ancestors to enhance\nmating success, in each case correlated to the invasion into habitats\nwith low mating group sizes. An independent evolution of dwarf males in\nIbla, Calanticidae, Chelonibia, Lepadomorpha and Scalpellidae dovetails\nwith males of these lineages having different morphologies and occurring\nin several different locations on their sexual partner. Within the\nCalanticidae, it appears that there is an upward translocation of dwarf\nmales from the stalk to the supra-rostral position of the large sexual\npartner.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian MCC tree","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76257","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76257.phy"}]}
