The hyaline to pale brown, fusiform,\n13-septate, guttulate, verrucose ascospores of N. phoenicis make it\ndistinct from others. Additional new taxa and their morphological\nfeatures, ecological occurence, as well as phylogenetic circumscription\nof the genera in Aigialaceae are provided and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121402.phy"}]}
