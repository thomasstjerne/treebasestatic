With an\nestimated early Campanian (Late Cretaceous) age, this dinosaur is one of\nthe oldest known hadrosaurids. Gryposaurus latidens shows several\nautapomorphies, including dentary tooth crowns, with an apicobasal\nlength/mesiodistal width ratio of 1.72.2, a single median carina, and\nlarge marginal denticles in sections of the dental battery; deep and\noval depression on the posteroventral premaxillary surface; and, in the\ncontext of Hadrosauridae, a shallow lacrimal process of the rostral\nprocess of the jugal. Furthermore, G. latidens differs from G. notabilis\nand G. monumentensis in having a broadly arcuate anterolateral oral\nmargin of the premaxilla, a posterior margin of the narial fenestra that\nis wider than the dorsoventral depth of the proximal region of the\nnarial bar, with a nasal crest that rises above the level of the\nfrontals (in adults) and is located above the posterior margin of the\nnarial fenestra, and wide and shallow posteroventral margin of the\nrostral process of the jugal, among other characters. This study\nconfirmed a previous hypothesis supporting G. latidens as the sister\ntaxon to a clade composed of the other species of Gryposaurus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 14","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hadrosaura phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55245.phy"}]}
