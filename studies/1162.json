Our data recognize three\nmajor clades in Alnus including subgenera Alnobetula, Clethropsis, and\nAlnus; subgenus Alnobetula is sister to the clade containing subgenera\nClethropsis and Alnus. The eastern Asian subgenus or section\nCremastogyne is embedded in the subgenus Alnus clade. A. nepalensis is\nmore closely related to subgenus Alnus than to subgenus Clethropsis. A.\nmaritima is allied with subgenus Clethropsis (excl. A. nepalensis).\nSubsessile or sessile male inflorescence and winter buds are probably\nplesiomorphies in Alnus, while synflorescences, one-year floral\nphenology, and fall-blooming may be derived features. The simple\naxillary female inflorescence has evolved more than once in Alnus.\nCentral and South American species of Alnus might be migrants from\neastern Asia via Bering Land Bridge and western North America. In\nsubgenus Clethropsis, A. formosana of eastern Asia is more closely\nrelated to eastern North American species than to the other Asian\nspecies, A. nitida. The low sequence divergence within both the A.\nincana and A. viridis species complexes suggests their recent history of\ndiversification in the circumpolar areas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alnus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1798.phy"}]}
