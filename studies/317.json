Their interrelationships are\nhypothesized as follows: brevibarbatus and danae are sister taxa,\nforming the sister group to other members of the genus. S. longibarbatus\nand pacificus, both formerly placed in Macrostomias, form a sister\nlineage to the remaining species. S. colubrinus and lampropeltis are\nsister taxa, as are affinis and nebulosus. S. atriventer, boa and\ngracilis form a group, with the latter two as sister taxa. The\nrelationships among the colubrinus, affinis and boa lineages remain\nunresolved, since there is conflicting evidence for two resolutions.\nEvidence for monophyly of the species is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomias","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1466.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomias","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1467.phy"}]}
