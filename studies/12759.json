The Rasberry Crazy Ant, as it has become known due to\nits uncertain species status, has since spread to neighboring states and\nis still a major concern to pest control officials. Previous attempts at\nidentifying this species have resulted in widely different conclusions\nin regards to its native range, source, and biology. We identify this\nhighly invasive pest species as Nylanderia fulva (Mayr) using\nmorphometric data measured from 14 characters, molecular sequence data\nconsisting of 4,669 aligned nucleotide sites from six independent loci\nand comparison with type specimens. This identification will allow for\nthe study and control of this emerging pest species to proceed\nunencumbered by taxonomic uncertainty. We also show that N. fulva has a\nmuch wider distribution than previously thought and has most likely\ninvaded all of the Gulf Coast states.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 ML","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rasberry Crazy Ant","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 BI","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rasberry Crazy Ant","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53017.phy"}]}
