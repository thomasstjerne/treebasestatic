Based on morphological\ncharacteristics, growth-temperature relationships, sequences of five DNA\nregions and pathogenicity assays the proposed novel species is described\nas Phytophthora pachypleura. Being homothallic with paragynous\nantheridia and semipapillate sporangia P. pachypleura resembles other\nspecies in the ‘P. citricola complex’ but can be separated due to its\ndistinctively thick-walled oospores with an oospore wall index of 0.71.\nIn the phylogenetic analysis P. pachypleura formed a distinct clade\nwithin the ‘P. citricola complex’ with P. citricola s.str. as its\nclosest relative. Lack of genetic variation suggests that the UK\npopulation might be the result of a clonal introduction. P. pachypleura\nis more aggressive on A. japonica than P. plurivora and P. multivora and\nhas the potential to affect other ornamentals.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66625.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66621.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66623.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66624.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66622.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora pachypleura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66620.phy"}]}
