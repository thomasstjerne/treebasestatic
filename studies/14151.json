In this study we applied phylogenetic inference to\nidentify and characterize isolates of Ceratocystis collected in a\nnatural savanna ecosystem in South Africa. Three new species were\nrecognized and are described as C. cryptoformis sp. nov. in the C.\nmoniliformis complex, as well as C. thulamelensis sp. nov. and C.\nzambeziensis sp. nov., both residing in the C. fimbriata complex.\nIncorporating the new species into global phylogenies of Ceratocystis\nprovided insights into the patterns of evolution and biogeography of\nthis group of fungi. Notably, the African continent was identified as an\nimportant centre of diversification of Ceratocystis spp., from which\nseveral lineages of these fungi were shown to have radiated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62985.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
