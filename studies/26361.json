Evidence for\nthe novelty and placement in Mycoenterolobium is based on comparison of\nmorphological data. The new species differs from the type species, M.\nplat-ysporum, in having shorter and wider conidia, and from M.\nflabelliforme in having much larg-er and wider conidia. The\nhyphomycetous genus Mycoenterolobium is similar to Cancellidi-um, but\ndiffers in the arrangement of conidial rows of cells at the attachment\npoint to the co-nidiophores. The conidia of the former are made up of\nrows of cells, radiating in a linear pat-tern from a single cell\nattached to the conidiophore, while in Cancellidium adherent rows of\nseptate branches radiating from the conidiophore. Cancellidium conidia\nalso contain branched chains of blastic monilioid cells arising from the\nconidia, while these are lacking in Mycoen-terolobium. At maturity in\nMycoenterolobium the two conidial lobes unite and are closely\nap-pressed. The present study provides DNA sequence data for\nMycoenterolobium aquadicty-osporium and based on the multigene\nphylogenetic analysis, the species clusters within Testu-dinaceae\n(Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Testudinaceae lsu SSU ITS TEF RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126211.phy"}]}
