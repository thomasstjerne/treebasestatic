This mushroom is macroscopically very similar\nto Hebeloma radicosum, also with a long ‘root’ and membranous ring, but\ndistinct molecularly and in its distribution. We also examine other\n‘rooting’ Hebeloma species from Japan: H. luchuense and H. radicosoides;\nboth are shown to be members of H. sect. Scabrispora. A fourth ‘rooting’\nHebeloma from Japan is shown to be the same as or a close relative of\nHebeloma danicum originally described from Europe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122553","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122555.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122551","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122551.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122552","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122554.phy"}]}
