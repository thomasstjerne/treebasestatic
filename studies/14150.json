Based on ITS and EF1-a sequence data and morphology, eight new\nspecies are described from Iran, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain. Of\nthese, five species are placed in Dothiorella, namely D. iranica, D.\nparva, D. prunicola, D. sempervirentis and D. striata, and three species\nbelong to Spencermartinsia named as S. citricola, S. mangiferae and S.\nplurivora. Two new combinations are also introduced in Dothiorella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ Tree","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63279.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Tree","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63280.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63281.phy"}]}
