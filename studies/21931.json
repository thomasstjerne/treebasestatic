Most\npublished studies in plants use taxon-specific target locus sets\ndeveloped individually for a clade using multiple genomic and\ntranscriptomic resources. General locus sets can also be developed from\nsets of loci that have been identified as single-copy and having\northologs in large clades of plants. Methods: We identify and compare a\ntaxon-specific locus set and three general locus sets for Buddleja\n(Scrophulariaceae). We evaluate their performance in terms of assembly\nsuccess, sequence variability, and resolution and support of inferred\nphylogenetic trees. Results: The taxon-specific locus set had the\ngreatest quantity of target loci. Assembly success was high for all\nlocus sets in Buddleja samples, but for outgroups general locus sets had\nsubstantially greater assembly success. Loci in the taxon-specific and\nPPR locus sets had the highest variability. The taxon-specific sequence\ndataset produced the best supported tree.\nDiscussion: We suggest that researchers consider including general locus\nsets as sequence capture targets for phylogenomic work, especially if\ngenomic resources are not available for their clade of interest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Appendix 3C","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buddleja ML tree from APVO SSC loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 4C","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SVD Quartets tree from APVO SSC loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108562.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 4D","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SVD Quartets tree from PPR loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108564.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3B","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree from COSII loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 4A","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buddleja SVD Quartets tree from taxon-specific\nloci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3D","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree from PPR loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3A","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree from taxon-specific loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108567.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 4B","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buddleja SVD Quartets tree from COSII loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108566.phy"}]}
