Phylogenetic relationships were\ninferred using DNA sequences (ITS, ndhF) and morphology (63 characters).\nThe monophyly of Trichostema is well supported in four analyses (ITS,\nndhF, ITS + ndhF, ITS + ndhF + morphology), but not in the analysis\nbased on morphological data alone. In all analyses, the monophyly of\nsections Chromocephalum and Trichostema is well supported. The monophyly\nof section Paniculatum is moderately supported, and there is conflicting\nevidence regarding the monophyly of section Orthopodium. Although DNA\ndata alone suggest that T. brachiatum is not a member of section\nOrthopodium, its retention in section Orthopodium is equivocal in the\ncombined DNA-morphology analyses. The submerging of the monotypic\nsection Rhodanthum into Paniculatum by Lewis and Rzedowski is not\nadopted because the monophyly of this grouping is poorly supported.\nBiogeographic history and character evolution (life history and\nchromosome number) are explored in the context of the phylogeny based on\nthe combined ITS and ndhF sequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichostema, ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichostema, molecular","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichostema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichostema, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2851.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichostema, morph","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2852.phy"}]}
