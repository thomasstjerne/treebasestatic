A taxonomic trend has resulted in recognizing this\ndiversity via smaller generic groupings, including several monotypes. A\nphylogenetic assessment of the monotypic genera Sundacarpus and Manoao\nwas conducted employing maximum parsimony analysis of sequence data from\n18S ribosomal DNA from 34 gymnosperm taxa, including 29 Podocarpaceae.\nIn resulting trees, there is high bootstrap support for Podocarpaceae,\nincluding Phyllocladus, but the order of deep branches within the family\nis equivocal. Prumnopitys (Sundacarpus) amara and four other Prumnopitys\nspp. comprise a clade with a bootstrap value of 100%, supporting the\nretention of Sundacarpus as a section of Prumnopitys. Lagarostrobos\nfranklinii and L. (Manoao) colensoi comprise a clade with equivocal\nbootstrap support, echoing previous results from parsimony analysis of\nmorphological data. A conservative approach (i.e., one avoiding\nunnecessary monotypes), favors the retention of L. colensoi in\nLagarostrobos, pending further evidence of relationships within the\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S rDNA strict consensus","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podocarpaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4020.phy"}]}
