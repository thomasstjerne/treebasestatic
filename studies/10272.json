A total of\n91 specimens, including eight outgroups and 83 Melaloncha (representing\n70 species) were included in the analyses. Parsimony analysis of the\ncombined dataset produced a single most parsimonious tree with varied\nBremer and bootstrap support of interior nodes. Bayesian analysis of\nmolecules only and of morphology + molecules produced trees largely in\nagreement with parsimony results, although with a few differences.\nSupported groups included subfamily Metopininae, genus Melaloncha, and\nsubgenera Melaloncha s. s. and M. (Udamochiras) Enderlein. Within the\nsubgenera, the previously recognized M. furcata, M. cingulata, M.\nungulata, and M. stylata groups were recovered, as well as some new\ngroupings. The M. furcata group was placed as the sister-group of other\nMelaloncha s. s., which is consistent with known host-attacking\nbehavior.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melaloncha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6884.phy"}]}
