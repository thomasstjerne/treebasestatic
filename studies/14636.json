In Venezuela since 2006, soft-rot symptoms have been\noccasionally observed in bell pepper fruits grown under greenhouse\nconditions. Affected fruits presented water-soaked lesions that\nprogressed upon completely fruit maceration. Bacteria were isolated from\nwater-soaked lesions in order to identify the causal agent of this\ndisease. Of 13 bacterial isolates recovered from affected fruits, only\nisolate AGPim1A was able to produce a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco\nplants and to reproduce soft-rot symptoms in bell peppers fruits.\nSeveral methods, including classical bacteriological tests and carbon\nutilization profiling, alongside with sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and\nhousekeeping genes gyrB and groES-groEL, allowed identifying the\nsoft-rotting bacterium as Serratia marcescens. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first report showing a S. marcescens strain associated with soft-rot\ndisease in bell pepper fruits.","trees":[{"tree_label":"groES-groEL","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Serratia groES-groEL NJ","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66104.phy"},{"tree_label":"gyrB","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Serratia gyrB NJ","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66105.phy"}]}
