Such features as a short orbital rim and\nthe presence of a sagittal crest indicate that this specimen belongs to\nTyrannosauroidea. Because the sediment cropping out at Tsagaan Teg is\nconsidered as belonging to the Cenomanian-Santonian Bayn Shire\nFormation, the present specimen contributes to improving the extremely\npoor fossil record of tyrannosauroid theropods in the lower Upper\nCretacous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tyrannosauroidea Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55254.phy"}]}
