It was recently\nshown that phages of the SPbeta group, infecting Bacillus subtilis,\nutilize a peptide-based communication system called arbitrium to\ncoordinate the lysogeny decision. In this study we show that the\npreviously described arbitrium system represents only a small subset of\na wide array of peptide-based communication systems utilized by phages\nfor lysogeny decisions. These arbitrium-like systems show diverse\npeptide codes and can be detected in numerous, genetically distant phage\ntypes and conjugative elements. The pathogens Bacillus anthracis,\nBacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis are commonly infected by\narbitrium-carrying mobile elements, which often carry toxins essential\nfor pathogenicity. Experiments with phages containing these\narbitrium-like systems demonstrate their involvement in lysogeny\ndecisions. Finally, our results suggest that the peptide-based decision\nis executed by an antisense RNA that controls the regulator of the\nlysogenic state.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"1180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of 1,180 AimR protein homologs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_116402.phy"}]}
