While chromosome duplications and deletions have\npredictable effects on genome size, chromosome fusion, fission, and\ntranslocation do not. In this study, we investigate genome size and\nchromosome number evolution in 87 species of Carex, one of the most\nspecies-rich genera of flowering plants and one that has undergone an\nexceptionally high rate of chromosome rearrangement. Using phylogenetic\ngeneralized least squares regression, we find that the correlation\nbetween chromosome number and genome size in the genus grades from flat\nor weakly positive at fine phylogenetic scales to weakly negative at\ndeeper phylogenetic scales. The rate of chromosome evolution exhibits a\nsignificant increase near the crown of a species-rich clade that arose\napproximately 5 million years ago. Genome size, however, demonstrates a\nnearly constant rate across the entire tree. This decoupling of the\nevolution of genome size from chromosome evolution may explain the high\nlability of chromosome number in the genus, as chromosome number shifts\ndo not incur any selective disadvantages in terms of genome size. Our\nresults also suggest that transitions in the rate of chromosome number\nevolution may govern lineage diversification in the temperate zoneÂ’s most\nspecies-rich angiosperm genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Carex","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_49191.phy"}]}
