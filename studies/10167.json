Recently, Townsend (2007, Profiling\nPhylogenetic Informativeness. Syst.Biol. 56, pp.Â 222-231) developed a\nmethod to profile the phylogenetic informativeness of a dataset through\ntime by linking its site-specific rates of change to its power to\nresolve relationships at different time scales. Here, we evaluate the\nperformance of Townsend s method in the case of two standard genetic\nmarkers for phylogenetic reconstruction, 28S rDNA and CO1 mtDNA, with\nmaximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses of\nrelationships within a group of parasitoid wasps (Hym.: Ichneumonidae,\nDiplazontinae). Retrieving phylogenetic informativeness profiles of the\ntwo genes from our own and from three additional datasets, we find that\nthe method repeatedly overestimates the performance of the more quickly\nevolving CO1 compared to 28S. We explore possible reasons for this bias,\nincluding phylogenetic uncertainty, violation of the molecular clock\nassumption, model misspecification and nonstationary nucleotide\ncomposition. As none of these provides a sufficient explanation of the\nobserved discrepancy, we use simulated datasets, based on an idealized\nsetting, to show that the optimum evolutionary rate decreases with\nincreasing number of taxa. We suggest that this relationship could\nexplain why the formula derived by Townsend from the four-taxon case\noverrates the performance of higher versus lower rates of evolution in\nour case, and that caution should be taken when the method is applied to\ndatasets including more than four taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian Con CO1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, CO1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6245.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Con 28S CO1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, 28S CO1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6469.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Con CO1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, CO1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5987.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Con 28S CO1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, 28S CO1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6293.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Con 28S","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian Con 28S","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diplazontinae, 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6410.phy"}]}
