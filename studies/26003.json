In this study, molecular analysis of Conidiobolus\ns.l. was reconstructed based on the combined nucLSU, TEF1-a and mtSSU\ndatasets, the result revealed three new lineages represented\nConidiobolus bifurcatus, C. taihushanensis and C. variabilis,\nrespectively. C. bifurcatus was related to C. brefeldianus and C.\nvariabilis was grouped with C. megalotocus with a relatively moderate\nsupport, while C. variabilis formed a highly supported lineage distinct\nfrom other Conidiobolus s.s. spp. The morphological difference of the\nnew species and their related species were discussed. A key to Chinese\nspecies of Conidiobolus s.s. has been provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122706","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122706.phy"}]}
