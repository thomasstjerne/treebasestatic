A total of 98 isolates were isolated from apple fruit with\nbitter rot and 53 isolates were from leaves with leaf spot. These\nisolates were characterized morphologically and sequenced with five gene\nregions (ITS, ACT, GAPDH, CHS-1 and TUB2). Combining morphological,\ncultural and pathogenic characters, phylogenetic analysis indicated that\nisolates from bitter rot were grouped into six species: C. alienum, C.\nfructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. nymphaeae, C. siamense and one new\ntaxon, C. orientalis. Among them, C. siamense was the predominant\npathogen associated with bitter rot, rather than C. gloeosporioides as\nreported previously. All species represent the first report associated\nwith apple bitter rot worldwide. Isolates from leaf spot were grouped\ninto two species, C. aenigma and C. fructicola. Pathogenicity testing\nshowed that strains from bitter rot were pathogenic on different apple\ncultivars, wheras strains from GLS were pathogenic on Gala but\nnon-pathogenic on Fuji apple.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76398.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP
