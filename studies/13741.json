This widespread conservation has\nfacilitated taxon-rich phylogenetic analyses that have resolved\norganismal relationships among many land plant groups. However, the\nrelationships among major fern lineages, especially the placement of\nEquisetales, remain enigmatic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of monilophyte plastid genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60485.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 A","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60487.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60499.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60500.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 C","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60561.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 D","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60564.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 C","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 D","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 D","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60566.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 E","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of monilophyte plastid genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60486.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 E","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60570.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 E","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60572.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 C","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60562.phy"},{"tree_label":"Supl Fig 2 B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Additional phylogenetic analyses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60498.phy"}]}
