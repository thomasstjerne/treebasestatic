Two atypical\nPRRS cases were observed in 2013 and 2014 characterized by late-term\nabortion, fever and sudden increase in sow mortality which persisted for\na prolonged period of time. Methods: Lungs, lymph nodes and other\nsamples were collected for disease investigation. Sequencing of the\nviral envelope glycoprotein (ORF5) and nucleocapsid protein (ORF7) of\nPRRSV was done using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit\nchemistry. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the Maximum\nLikelihood method, generated by Mega 6Â®. Results: Analysis of the ORF5\nand ORF7 showed high degree of sequence homology to PRRSV parent vaccine\nstrain VR-2332, RespPRRSV and other mutant/chimeric virus strains.\nConclusions: Our study suggests that recombination events between\nvaccine strains and field isolates may contribute to PRRSV virulence in\nthe field.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Porcine Reproductive & Respiratory Syndrome Virus\nORF5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100900.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Porcine Reproductive & Respiratory Syndrome Virus\nORF7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100901.phy"}]}
