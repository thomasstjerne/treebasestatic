Here we show that paedomorphosis can\nalso be involved in an increase in ecological specialization, in this\ncase of plant-pollinator relationships. A paedomorphic transition from\ngeneralized pollination (by several functional types of pollinators) to\nspecialized pollination (by one or a few species in one functional type)\noccurred in a clade of endemic Malagasy vines (Dalechampia spp.,\nEuphorbiaceae). This evolutionary transition involved staminate flowers\nthat fail to develop “normally,” instead holding mature pollen inside\nvirtually unopened, bud-like flowers. This paedomorphic morphology\nrestricts reward access to “buzz-pollinating” bees, specifically\nXylocopa sp. (carpenter bees), which can remove pollen by sonication.\nThis is one of very few reports of paedomorphic specialization, and, as\nfar as we are aware, the first documented case of a rapid reversal to\nspecialized pollination in a lineage of plants that had previously\nswitched from specialized to generalized pollination in conjunction with\ndispersing to a new region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dalechampia Bayes 0.5 Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58026.phy"}]}
