However, in groups with no obvious morphological\ninnovations, observed upticks in diversification rates have also been\nattributed to the colonization of a new geographic environment. In this\nstudy, we explore the systematics, diversification dynamics, and\nhistorical biogeography of the plant clade Rhinantheae in the\nOrobanchaceae, with a special focus on the Andean clade of the genus\nBartsia. METHODS: We sampled taxa from across Rhinantheae, including a\nrepresentative sample of Andean Bartsia species. Using standard\nphylogenetic methods, we reconstructed evolutionary relationships,\ninferred divergence times among the clades of Rhinantheae, elucidated\ntheir biogeographic history, and investigated diversification dynamics.\nKEY RESULTS: We confirmed that the South American Bartsia species form a\nhighly supported monophyletic group. The median crown age of Rhinantheae\nwas determined to be ca. 30 Ma, and Europe played an important role in\nthe biogeographic history of the lineages. South America was first\nreconstructed in the biogeographic analyses around 9 Ma, and with a\nmedian age of 2.59 Ma, this clade shows a significant uptick in\ndiversification. CONCLUSIONS: Increased net diversification of the South\nAmerican clade corresponds to biogeographic movement into the New World.\nThis movement happened at a time when the Andes were reaching the\nnecessary elevation to host an alpine environment. Although a specific\nroute could not be identified with certainty, we provide plausible\nhypotheses to how the group colonized the New World.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46149.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46180","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46180.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46107.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46147.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46148","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46148.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46150.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46151.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46152.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46154.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46153.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46155.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46156.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46158.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46157.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46159","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46159.phy"}]}
