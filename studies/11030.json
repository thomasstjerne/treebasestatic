Simple Models of Protein Evolution\nand the Contribution of Structurally Viable Reconstructions to the\nLikelihood.","Journal":" Systematic Biology","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Phylogenetics, protein structure, maximum likelihood,\nempirical amino acid models, ancestral state reconstruction","DOI":"","Abstract":" Most phylogenetic models of protein evolution assume that\nsites are independent and identically distributed. Interactions between\nsites are ignored, and the likelihood can be conveniently calculated as\nthe product of the individual site-likelihoods. The calculation\nconsiders all possible transition paths (also called substitution\nhistories or mappings) that are consistent with the observed states at\nthe terminals, and the probability density of any particular\nreconstruction depends on the substitution model. The likelihood is the\nintegral of the probability density of each substitution history taken\nover all possible histories that are consistent with the observed data.\nWe investigated the extent to which transition paths that are\nincompatible with a protein’s three-dimensional structure contribute to\nthe likelihood. Several empirical amino-acid models were tested for\nsequence pairs of different degrees of divergence. When simulating\nsubstitutional histories starting from a real sequence, the structural\nintegrity of the simulated sequences quickly disintegrated. This result\nindicates that simple models are clearly unable to capture the\nconstraints on sequence evolution. However, when we sampled transition\npaths between real sequences from the posterior probability distribution\naccording to these same models, we found that the sampled histories were\nlargely consistent with the tertiary structure. This suggests that\nsimple empirical substitution models may be adequate for interpolating\nchanges between observed sequences during phylogenetic inference despite\nthe fact that the models cannot predict the effects of structural\nconstraints from first principles. This study is significant because it\nprovides a quantitative assessment of the biological realism of\nsubstitution models from the perspective of protein structure, and it\nprovides insight on the prospects for improving models of protein\nsequence evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Poisson1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25798.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25799.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25800.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25801.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25802.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25803.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25807.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25809.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25810.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25811.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25812.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25815.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25814.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25817","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25818","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25818.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25819.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25820.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25821","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25821.phy"},{"tree_label":"Poisson1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25825.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25804.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25805.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25806.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25813","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25813.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25823.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25824.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25831.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25832.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG3","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25833.phy"},{"tree_label":"WAG1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25822","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25822.phy"},{"tree_label":"LG2","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25829","tree_kind":
