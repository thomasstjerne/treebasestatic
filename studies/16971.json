Despite a flood of genome\nsequencing and functional genomics data, there are still significant\ngaps in knowledge between genome and phenome, which seriously hinder\nefforts toward the treatment of mycobacterial diseases and practical\nbiotechnological applications. In this study, we propose the use of\nsystematic, comparative functional pan-genomic analysis to build\nconnections between genomic dynamics and phenotypic evolution in\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolism in the genus\nMycobacterium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree of 27 mycobacteria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_81028.phy"}]}
