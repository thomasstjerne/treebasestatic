Lachemilla\nrothmaleriana is characterized by its stout stems, sericeous-villous\nindumentum, and wide ascending sheaths with trilobate lateral lobes.\nLachemilla argentea presents a unique combination of tripartite basal\nleaves with an adaxial silvery villous indumentum, and decumbent\nbranches with verticillate lobed sheaths. Finally, Lachemilla cyanea has\ndistinctly basal reniform leaves with a blue-green color and hirsute\npubescence. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear ribosomal cistron and\nmultiple regions of the plastid genome revealed the allopolyploid origin\nof the three new taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachemilla Bayesian cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119084.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachemilla Bayesian nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachemilla MLT nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119087.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lachemilla MLT cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119085.phy"}]}
