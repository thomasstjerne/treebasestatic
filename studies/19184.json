In 2013, five\nsamplings were conducted in different production areas at various\naltitudes. Leaves, apical stems, and symptomatic ripe and unripe fruits\nof the coffee variety Red Caturra were collected for analyses. Isolates\nwere obtained and the Colletotrichum species were morphologically\nidentified and characterized by multilocus sequence analyses of ACT,\nCAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 genes and rDNA regions. Additionally, pathogenicity\ntests were conducted for six isolates. We identified Colletotrichum\ngigasporum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum karstii (two\nisolates), Colletotrichum siamense, and Colletotrichum theobromicola.\nThis is the first report of the pathogenicity of these five species in\ncoffee tree leaves. The symptoms of infection caused by these species\nwere characterized, but the species causing Coffee Berry Disease was not\nfound. This is the first identification of a complex of species\naffecting coffee plants in the same geographical area in Mexico, and\nsuggests that other complexes of species may be important pathogens in\ncoffee-producing areas elsewhere","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95552.phy"}]}
