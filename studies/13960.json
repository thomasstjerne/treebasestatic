Recent findings indicate that coccoid lineages in this order\nare very diverse genetically and may be the prevalent form, although\ntheir diversity is often hidden morphologically. This study\ncharacterizes coccoid algae recently discovered from desert soil crusts\nthat share morphological and ecological features with the genera\nBracteacoccus, Pseudomuriella, and Chromochloris. Analyses of a\nmulti-gene data set that includes members from all sphaeroplealean\nfamilies are used to examine the monophyly of these morphologicaly\nsimilar taxa, which are shown instead to be phylogenetically distinct\nand very divergent. We propose new generic names for these lineages:\nBracteamorpha, Rotundella, and Tumidella. In addition, we propose an\nupdated family-level taxonomy within Sphaeropleales that includes ten\nnew families of coccoid algae to accommodate the newly-presented genera\nand many incertae sedis taxa in the order: Bracteamorphaceae,\nChromochloridaceae, Dictyococcaceae, Dictyochloridaceae, Mychonastaceae,\nPseudomuriellaceae, Rotundellaceae, Schizochlamydaceae, Schroederiaceae,\nand Tumidellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphaeropleales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66317.phy"}]}
