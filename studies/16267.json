To determine whether\nspecies found in the same or neighboring ecoregions are closely related,\nwe sampled more than 50 taxa, with an emphasis on species found in\nMexico and Central America. We evaluated five DNA markers for their\nphylogenetic utility: the nuclear low copy gene PHYC, a plastid spacer\nregion trnL-F, a fragment of the plastid ycf1 gene, rpl32-trnL, and the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA; we\nsampled only the last three markers for the main analyses based on an\nassessment of phylogenetic informativeness. We analyzed plastid regions\nand ITS separately in phylogenetic inference using a variety of methods,\nas we found strong incongruence between them, according to the ILD test.\nWe also estimated clade ages using a relaxed molecular clock with\nindirect calibrations based on a larger taxonomic sampling. Encyclia is\na monophyletic genus that originated ca. 12.43 Ma (10.55Â–14.25 Ma) ago,\nand has undergone several recent evolutionary radiations. We found a\nstrong association between phylogenetic relationships and the geographic\ndistribution of species and clades in the Caribbean, Central American,\nand the Pacific coast of Megamexico. Several groups of Encyclia occur in\nthe latter region, the most species-rich being the E. meliosma complex,\nwhich is restricted to the Pacific slope of Mexico from north of the\nIsthmus of Tehuantepec up to Sonora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rep8BEST","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77103","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77103.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77107.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77105","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77105.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Encyclia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77108.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77123","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77123.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77131","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77131.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77130","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77130.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77129.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77127","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77127.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep2BEST","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77116.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77117.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77125","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77125.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep1BEST","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77124","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77124.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77106.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP2","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77128","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77128.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77126.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77115","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77104","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77104.phy"}]}
