Because\naccelerated rates of morphological evolution accompany the transition to\nthe truffle form, closely related epigeous ancestors remain unknown for\nmost truffle lineages. This is the case for the quintessential truffle\ngenus Tuber, which includes species with socio-economic importance and\nesteemed culinary attributes. Ecologically, Tuber spp. form obligate\nmycorrhizal symbioses with a diverse species of plant hosts including\npines, oaks, poplars, orchids, and commercially important trees such as\nhazelnut and pecan. Unfortunately, limited geographic sampling and\ninconclusive phylogenetic relationships have obscured our understanding\nof their origin, biogeography, and diversification. To address this\nproblem, we present a global sampling of Tuberaceae based on DNA\nsequence data from four loci for phylogenetic inference and molecular\ndating. Our well-resolved Tuberaceae phylogeny shows high levels of\nregional and continental endemism. We also identify a previously unknown\nepigeous member of the Tuberaceae  the South American cup-fungus\nNothojafnea thaxteri (Cash) Gamundí. Phylogenetic resolution was further\nimproved through the inclusion of a previously unrecognized Southern\nhemisphere sister group of the Tuberaceae. This morphologically diverse\nassemblage of fungi includes truffle forms endemic to Australia and\nSouth America (e.g. Gymnohydnotrya spp.) and non-truffle species. The\nSouthern hemisphere taxa appear to have diverged more recently than the\nNorthern hemisphere lineages. Our analysis of the Tuberaceae suggests\nthat Tuber evolved from an epigeous ancestor. Molecular dating estimates\nthat the Tuberaceae diverged in the late Jurassic (~156 million years\nago), with subsequent radiations in the Cretaceous and Paleogene.\nIntra-continental diversification, limited long-distance dispersal, and\necological adaptations have driven truffle evolution and Tuberaceae\nbiodiversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.
