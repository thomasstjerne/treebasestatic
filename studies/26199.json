Each clade\nwas recognized as a species from the morphological characteristics and\nother features, respectively. Five species of Phyllosticta sensu stricto\nwere recognized, and two of them were newly recorded in Japanese\nmycoflora. Furthermore, new comibination P. pilospora and its epitype\nare proposed. The epitype and ex-type strain are also proposed for P.\ncryptomeriae in this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta parasitic fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125426.phy"}]}
