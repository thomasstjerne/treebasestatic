Morphological, anatomical and latex\ntriterpenoid data are interpreted in light of the molecular results, and\ndiscrepancies are discussed. Vegetative characters are better indicators\nof relationship than floral characters, especially corona characters.\nThe monophyly of all Malagasy species and, nested within the latter, of\nall stem-succulent taxa is ascertained and the genera Folotsia,\nKarimbolea, Platykeleba and Sarcostemma are subsumed under Cynanchum.\nOne African species, C. galgalense, is excluded from Cynanchum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4043.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4044.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynanchum cpDNA+ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4045.phy"}]}
