These two genera are included in the subfamily\nRoestinae which is supported by seven synapomorphies. The Cynodontinae\nis proposed as the sister group of the Roestinae and the clade Roestinae\n+ Cynodontinae is demonsrated to form a monophyletic group named the\nCynodontidae; four synapomorphies were found to characterize this\nfamily. The Acestrorhynchidae (including only Acestrorhynchus) is\nproposed as the sister group of the Cynodontidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cynodontidae and Acestrorhynchidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53854.phy"}]}
