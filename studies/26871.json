It is a novel dothideomycete species supported by\nmorphological, cultural characters and phylogenetic analysis (nucleotide\nsequences data rDNA analysis). The new species is characterized by\nconidiophores often with 2Â–4 enteroblastic, percurrent proliferations,\nlarge, globose, golden brown or reddish brown conidia that are borne\nsingly or in basipetal chains, verrucose to irregular lobate crests,\nborn singly or in basipetal chains of two conidia; acropetally\nproliferating; conidiogenesis holoblastic. The morphology of P.\ncitlaltepetlensis is compared to other Periconia species and a detailed\ndescription and morphological illustrations are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Periconia citlaltepetlensis sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Barcode Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125629.phy"}]}
