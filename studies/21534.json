S. schweitzeri has not been associated with human infections,\nbut has been isolated from non-human primates. Questions regarding the\nevolution of pathogenicity of these two species will remain elusive\nuntil an exploratory evolutionary framework is established. Results: We\npresent genomic comparison analysis among members of SAC based on a\npan-genome definition, which included 15 S. argenteus genomes (five\nnewly sequenced), six S. schweitzeri genomes and 30 divergent S. aureus\ngenomes. The three species had divergent core genomes and rare\ninterspecific recombination was observed among the core genes. However,\nsome subtypes of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)\nelements and prophages were present in different species. Of 111 tested\nvirulence genes of S. aureus, 85 and 86 homologous genes were found in\nS. argenteus and S. schweitzeri, respectively. There was no difference\nin virulence gene content among the three species, but the sequence of\nmost core virulence genes was divergent. Analysis of the agr locus and\nthe genes in the capsular polysaccharides biosynthetic operon revealed\nthat they both diverged before the speciation of SAC members.\nFurthermore, the widespread geographic distribution of S. argenteus,\nsequence type 2250, showed ambiguous biogeographical structure among\ngeographically isolated populations, demonstrating an international\nspread of this pathogen. Meanwhile, many results indicated that S.\naureus is more closely related to S. schweitzeri than S. argenteus.\nConclusions: S. argenteus has spread among several countries, and\ninvasive infections and persistent carriage may be not limited to\ncurrently reported regions. S. argenteus probably had undergone a recent\nhost adaption and can cause human infections with a similar pathogenic\npotential.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106800","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106800.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106801.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106804.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106805.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106815.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106822","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106807.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106806.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106812.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106802.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"3103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106803.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106810.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106811.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106813","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106813.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106814.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106816.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106817","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106817.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106818","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106818.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106819.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106820","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106820.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106821","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106821.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106823","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106823.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106824","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106824.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106825","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106825.phy"}]}
