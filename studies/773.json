Published sequences of 20\nadditional species of the russuloid clade were also included.\nPhylogenetic analyses suggest that Aleurodiscus s.l., Megalocystidium\nleucoxanthum, Stereum and Xylobolus form a monophyletic group, which may\nbe classified as the family Stereaceae. Corticium roseum, which is the\ntype species of the Corticiaceae, is not in this group, thus Stereaceae\nis not synonymous with Corticiaceae. Aleurocystidiellum is supported as\na monophyletic group. Acanthobasidium, which is characterized by\npleurobasidia, is also monophyletic. Aleurodiscus s.s. is supported as\nmonophyletic, but Gloeosoma is not, and the two are not congeneric. The\nimportance of amyloid acanthophyses for recognizing Aleurobotrys is\nsuspect, and its generic status should be further studied. Most of the\nsmooth-spored species form a monophyletic group. Phylogenetic analyses\nsuggest that there has been homoplasy in most of the characters that\nhave been used to subdivide Aleurodiscus s.l., including spore\nornamentation, hymenial color, hyphal septation, clamp connections,\nacanthophyses, and phenoloxidase reactions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aleurodiscus s.l. analysis 2 tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3882.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aleurodiscus s.l. analysis 1 tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3883.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aleurodiscus s.l. analysis 3 tree 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3884.phy"}]}
