Phylogenetic analyses based on 10 chloroplast DNA\nregions and 22 morphological characters were conducted in order to 1)\nexamine evolutionary relationships within Lithospermum and among related\ngenera of Boraginaceae and 2) investigate patterns of morphological\nevolution. Several morphological features, such as long-funnelform\ncorollas, faucal appendages, reciprocal herkogamy, and evident secondary\nleaf venation, have evolved multiple times within the genus. In\ncontrast, other morphological features, including the presence of glands\nand the position and number of pollen pores, are less plastic and tend\nto characterize larger clades. Some features, including the presence of\nglands, are interpreted as symplesiomorphic for Lithospermum, while\nothers, such as evident secondary leaf venation, appear to have\noriginated repeatedly. The range of structural diversity that occurs\namong the species of Lithospermum suggests the potential utility of this\ngenus as a model for integrative studies of evolution, development, and\nmolecular biology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lithospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31331.phy"}]}
