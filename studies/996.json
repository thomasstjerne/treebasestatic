Fusarium\ncommune is characterised by and distinguished from its putative sister\ntaxon, the F. oxysporum complex, in having long, slender monophialides\nand polyphialides when cultured in complete darkness. Based on the\ncombined DNA sequence data from translation elongation factor 1a (EF-1a)\nand the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal DNA (mtSSU rDNA), the\nfifteen isolates of F. commune analysed formed a strongly supported\nclade closely related to but independent of the F. oxysporum and the\nGibberella fujikuroi species complexes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4097.phy"}]}
