Both taxa resemble several\nother recently described Australian sequestrate Agaricus species, in\nparticular A. pachydermus, A. wariatodes and A. chartaceus, which all\nhave a powdery hymenophore from very early stages of basidiome\nformation. Both novel species have affinities to section Minores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Agaricus sections Minores and Arvenses based on ITS\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59112.phy"}]}
