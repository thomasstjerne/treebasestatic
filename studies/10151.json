This study was undertaken to determine the presence\nand diversity of other members of the Diatrypaceae in grapevines in\nCalifornia. We isolated into pure culture 11 species of Diatrypaceae\nfrom the wood of diseased grapevines including Cryptosphaeria\npullmanensis, Cryptovalsa ampelina, Diatrype oregonensis, D. stigma, D.\nwhitmanensis, Diatrype sp, Diatrypella verrucaeformis and four putative\nspecies of Eutypella. Species were identified or grouped morphologically\nand by phylogenetic analyses of the complete sequence of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) of the rDNA and β-tubulin gene. Diatrypaceous\nfungi also occurred frequently on the native flora surrounding\nvineyards, thus serving as possible inoculum sources for these putative\npathogens. \n","trees":[{"tree_label":"BETA PAUP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5997.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6218.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS PAUP 2","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6219.phy"},{"tree_label":"BETA PAUP 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5999.phy"},{"tree_label":"BETA PAUP 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5998.phy"},{"tree_label":"BETA PAUP 4","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6000.phy"}]}
