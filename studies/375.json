Five shortest trees were\nfound (length = 318; consistency index for informative characters =\n0.6341 which differed only in details of relationships among three\nspecies of Branta. The trees supported (1) Cnemiornis as sister group to\nother taxa analyzed; (2) a sister group relationship between the\nmoa-nalos of Hawaii and other geese and swans; (3) Cereopsis as sister\ngroup of Anser, Branta, Coscoroba, and Cygnus (contra Livezey, 1986, Auk\n103:737-754); (4) monophyly of Anser, Branta, and tGeochen and\nconfirmation of generic monophyly of each; and (5) Coscoroba as sister\ngroup to Cygnus. Selechve exclusion of fossil taxa from the analysis\nvariably affected inferred relationships and had substantial impacts on\ncomputational efficiency. Some nodes were not robust to boot-strapping:\n(1) nodes relating species groups within Anser, Cygnus, and\ntThambetochen and (2) the node uniting Anser, Branta, Coscoroba, and\nCygnus relative to Cereopsis. Bremer (decay) indices indicated similar\ndifferences in relafive support for nodes. Skeletal characters were\ncomparatively important in establishing higher order relahonships,\nwhereas integumentary characters were crit-ical for lower order\ninferences. Constrained analyses revealed that other proposed\nphylogenetic hypotheses entailed variable penalities in parsimony. The\nshortest tree(s) was considered with respect to selected\necomorphological attributes (e.g., body mass, sexual size dimorphism,\nclutch size) and biogeography, and a revised phylogenetic classificahon\nof the geese and swans is pro-posed.
