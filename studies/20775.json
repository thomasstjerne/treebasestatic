We\namplified nrLSU, nrITS, and rpb1 genes across the Polyporales, with a\nspecial focus on the latter. We combined the new sequences with\nmolecular data generated during the Poly- PEET project and performed\nMaximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Analyses of our\nfinal 3-gene dataset (292 Polyporales taxa) provide a phylogenetic\noverview of the order that we translate here into a formal family-level\nclassification. Eighteen clades are assigned a family name, including\nthree families described as new (Cerrenaceae fam. nov., Gelatoporiaceae\nfam. nov., Panaceae fam. nov.) and fifteen others (Dacryobolaceae,\nFomitopsidaceae, Grifolaceae, Hyphodermataceae, Incrustoporiaceae,\nIrpicaceae, Ischnodermataceae, Laetiporaceae, Meripilaceae, Meruliaceae,\nPhanerochaetaceae, Podoscyphaceae, Polyporaceae, Sparassidaceae,\nSteccherinaceae). Three clades are given informal names\n(/hypochnicium,/climacocystis and/fibroporia þ amyloporia). Four taxa\n(Candelabrochete africana, Mycoleptodonoides vassiljevae, Auriporia\naurea, and Tyromyces merulinus) cannot be assigned to a family within\nthe Polyporales. The classification proposed here provides a framework\nfor further taxonomic revision and will facilitate communication among\napplied and basic scientists. A survey of morphological, anatomical,\nphysiological, and genetic traits confirms the plasticity of characters\npreviously emphasized in taxonomy of Polyporales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"312","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103350","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103350.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103351","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103349.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103352","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103352.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"312","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103354","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103354.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"294","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103357","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103357.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"281","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fragiliporiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103358.phy"}]}
