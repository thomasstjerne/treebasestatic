Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is the\nmost important food and forage legume in the semi-arid tropics of\nsub-Saharan Africa where approximately 80% of worldwide production takes\nplace primarily on low-input, subsistence farm sites. Among the major\ngoals of cowpea breeding and improvement programs are the rapid\nmanipulation of agronomic traits for seed size and quality and improved\nresistance to abiotic and biotic stresses to enhance productivity.\nKnowing the suite of transcription factors (TFs) and transcriptionally\nactive proteins (TAPs) that control various critical plant cellular\nprocesses would contribute tremendously to these improvement aims.\nResults. We used a computational approach that employed three different\npredictive pipelines to data mine the cowpea genome and identified over\n4,400 genes representing 136 different TF and TAP families. We compare\nthe information content of cowpea to two evolutionarily close species\ncommon bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), and soybean (Glycine max) to gauge the\nrelative informational content. Our data indicate that correcting for\ngenome size cowpea has fewer TF and TAP genes than common bean (4408 /\n5291) and soybean (4408/ 11065). Members of the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR\n(GRF) and Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) gene families appear to\nbe over-represented in the genome relative to common bean and soybean,\nwhereas members of the MADS (Minichromosome maintenance deficient 1\n(MCM1), AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, and serum response factor (SRF)) and\nC2C2-YABBY appear to be under-represented. Analysis of the AP2-EREBP\nAPETALA2-Ethylene Responsive Element Binding Protein (AP2-EREBP), NAC\n(NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF1, 2 (Arabidopsis transcription\nactivation factor), CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)), and WRKY families,\nknown to be important in defense signaling, revealed changes and\nphylogenetic rearrangements relative to common bean and soybean that\nsuggest these groups may have evolved different functions. Conclusions.\nThe availability of detailed information on the coding capacity of the\ncowpea genome and in particular the various TF and TAP gene families\nwill facilitate future comparative analysis and development of\nstrategies for controlling growth, differentiation, and abiotic and\nbiotic stress resistances of cowpea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean BES","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107926","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean TUB","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean GRF","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107920.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean CCAATHAP5","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean mTERF","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea WRKY","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean AUXIAA","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107924.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean B3","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107917.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea bean TIFY","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Common bean NAC","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107925","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107925.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea NAC","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107927","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107927.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cowpea AP2EREBP","ntax":"159","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107928.phy"}]}
