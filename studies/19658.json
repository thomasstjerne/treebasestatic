All three of these new species fruit on the ground in\nassociation with species of the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree genus Dicymbe\n(Fabaceae subfam. Caesalpinioideae) and one species has been shown to\nform ectomycorrhizas. Multi-locus molecular phylogenetic analyses place\nGuyanagarika gen. nov. within the Catathelasma clade, a lineage in the\nsuborder Tricholomatineae of the Agaricales. We formally recognize this\n“Catathelasma clade” as an expanded family Catathelasmataceae that\nincludes the genera Callistosporium, Catathelasma, Guyanagarika,\nMacrocybe, Pleurocollybia, and Pseudolaccaria. Within the\nCatathelasmataceae, Catathelasma and Guyanagarika represent independent\norigins of the ectomycorrhizal habit. Guyanagarika is the first\ndocumented case of an ECM Agaricales genus known only from the\nNeotropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"269","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Guyanagarika","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97613.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Catathelasmataceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97614.phy"}]}
