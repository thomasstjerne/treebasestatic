Beauv. comprises nearly 90, mostly New World,\nspecies characterized by having spikelets with the inverse position\n(i.e., the backs of the upper glume and the upper lemma turned away from\nthe rachis). The genus has been divided into four sections, five series,\nand three subseries, based exclusively on morphological features.\nPrevious phylogenetic analyses based on a limited sampling of species\nshowed Axonopus to be a monophyletic genus. In this study we increased\nthe number of species sampled (46 species in the combined tree) and\nsequenced four DNA regions (external transcribed spacer [ETS], internal\ntranscribed spacer [ITS], trnL-F, and ndhF). We tested the monophyly of\nAxonopus and its traditional infrageneric categories using parsimony,\nlikelihood, and Bayesian inference. Additionally, we performed ancestral\ncharacter state reconstructions of 45 morphological characters to infer\nautapomorphies for the species and synapomorphies for the genus and\nclades. Our findings confirmed Axonopus as a monophyletic genus only\nwhen Centrochloa Swallen and Ophiochloa Filg., Davidse & Zuloaga are\nincluded within it. Our analyses also showed that, with the exception of\nsection Lappagopsis, infrageneric categories from previous\nclassifications of the genus are artificial. Twenty-one morphological\ncharacter states were identified as potential autapomorphies; two were\nreconstructed as potential synapomorphies for Axonopus, whereas 12 were\nreconstructed as potential synapomorphies for specific clades within the\ngenus. Further molecular analyses, including sequencing of unlinked\nnuclear genes, are needed in order to reach a robust phylogenetic\nclassification of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ndhF_Strict Consensus of 20000 trees from Trees stored\nin block “Imported trees”","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124885","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124885.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Axonopus 50% majority-rule consensus tree from the BI\nanalysis of the total combined dataset (ETS, ITS, ndhF and trnL-F\nregions)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124710.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML_tree_todos","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124711.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F_Strict Consensus of 45 trees from Trees stored\nin block “Imported trees”","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124888","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124888.phy"},{"tree_label":"plastid_Strict Consensus of 20000 trees from Trees\nstored in block “Imported trees”","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124875","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124875.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucleo_con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124869","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124869.phy"},{"tree_label":"ETS_con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124877","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124877.phy"},{"tree_label":"ETS_ML","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124878","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124878.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucleo_ML","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124871","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124871.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucleo_Strict Consensus of 160 trees from Trees stored\nin block “Imported trees”","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124872","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124872.phy"},{"tree_label":"todos_Strict Consensus of 160 trees from Trees stored\nin block “Imported trees”","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124870","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124870.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree_plastid","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124874","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124874.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_Strict Consensus of 32 trees from Trees stored in\nblock “Imported trees”","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124882","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124882.phy"},{"tree_label":"plastid_con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124873","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124873.phy"},{"tree_label":"ndhF_con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124883","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124883.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree_ndhF","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124884","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124884.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree_ITS","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124881","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124881.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124880","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124880.phy"},{"tree_label":"ETS_Strict Consensus of 1099 trees from Trees stored in\nblock “Imported trees”","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124879","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124879.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL_con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124886","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124886.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree_trnL-F","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124887","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_124887.phy"}]}
