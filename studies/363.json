Sixty-eight characters used in the analyses were\nderived from a comprehensive range of somatic and genital systems. T he\noptimal result, in terms of maximal number of characters attd taxa and\nof parsimony, produced two trees (consistency index 0.362) differing\nonly in the placement of the mottotypic clade for the family\nLumbriculidae. From a line originating from the presumed octogonadial\nancestor, the following branches were derived, in sequence from the\nbasal to most derived (new =Asterisked): subclass Randiellata* (order\nRandiellida, Randiellidae); subclass Tubificata (order\nTubificida, Tubificidae Naididae computed and others not computed);\nsubclass Lumbriculata* (order Lumbricuiida, Lumbriculidae); superorder\nHaplotaxidea* (order Haplotaxida, Haplotaxidae); order Moniligastrida\n(Moniligastridae); suborder Alluroidina (Alluroididae and\nSyngenodrilidae); cohort Aquamegadrili* (with, in succession,\nsuperfamilies Sparganophiloidea, Sparganophilidae; Biwadriloidea,\nBiwadrilidae, and Almoidea-Lutodrilidae and Almidae, including\n(Criodrilus); superfamily Eudriloidea, superfamily Lumbricoidea and,\nas the adelphotaxon of the latter, tht superfamily Megascolecoidea.\nIntermediate nodes were given the following names, with the adelphotaxon\nthrough to the .Megascolecoidea, M, in parentheses: subclass\nDiplotesticulata (Haplotaxidea M); superorder Metagynopohora\n(Moniligastrida M); order Opisthopora (Alluroidina M); suborder\nCrassiclitellata* (Aquamegadrili M); cohort Terrimegadrili*\n(Ocnerodriloidea M); unnamed (Eudriloidea M); unnamed (Lumbricoidea and\nMegascolecoidea). Recognition of the Randiellata, which alone were added\nintuitively and not computed, and the position of the Lumbriculata, are\ntentative. Location of the Lumbricoidea as the adelphotaxon of,t\nrestricted Mcgascoecloidea is heuristic, but the alternative depiction\nof lumbricoids in some analyses, as the adelphotaxon of an\nocnerodrilid-eudrilid-megascolecoid clade (the conventional\nMegascolecoidea s. lat.), is not conclusively dismissed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oligochaeta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oligochaeta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3242.phy"}]}
