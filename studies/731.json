A new genus and three new species from\nChile are described here: Proglypholoma aenigma gen. et sp. nov.,\napparently the most basal member of Glypholomatinae; Glypholoma germaini\nsp. nov.; and G. chepuense sp. nov. New records are presented for all\npreviously known species, and known distributions of all species are\nmapped. Analysis of relationships among the species is presented and the\nbiogeography of the subfamily is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 32","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glypholomatinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3802.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 32 inset","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glypholomatinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3801.phy"}]}
