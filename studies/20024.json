Islandici were reexamined to determine\nthe prevalence of isolates from maize and the built environment. Using\nphenotypic analysis, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis we\ndiscovered and described ten new species in section Islandici and one\nnew species in section Subinflati. Taxonomic novelties from sect.\nIslandici: Talaromyces delawarensis, Talaromyces herodensis, Talaromyces\njuglandicola, Talaromyces kilbournensis, Talaromyces novojersensis,\nTalaromyces ricevillensis, Talaromyces rogersiae, Talaromyces siglerae,\nTalaromyces subtropicalis and Talaromyces tiftonensis, the species from\nsection Subinflata is Talaromyces tzapotlensis. The isolate of T.\nsiglerae is unusual in Talaromyces in that it produced a Paecilomyces\nanamorphic state. Regardless of the anamorphic state, the phylogenetic\nanalysis places it in Talaromyces. Talaromyces rotundus is known from\nthe type isolate but by searching GenBank it is possible to infer that\nT. rotundus is an endophyte of the lichen Lasallia hispanica.\nTalaromyces wortmannii although common on corn also has a role as an\nendophyte of the aquatic plant Persicaria amphibia. It appears that T.\nrogersiae and T. tiftonensis are primarily endophytes of corn.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_27","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99052","tree_kind":"Species
