Combined analysis of\nLSU, SSU and RPB2 gene data, showed that the species clusters with\nLentithecium arundinaceum, Setoseptoria phragmitis and Stagonospora\nmacropycnidia in the family Lentitheciaceae and is close to Katumotoa\nbambusicola and Ophiosphaerella sasicola. Therefore, a monotypic genus,\nPoaceascoma is introduced to accommodate the scolecosporous species\nPoaceascoma helicoides. The species has similar morphological characters\nto the genera Acanthophiobolus, Leptospora and Ophiosphaerella and these\ngenera are compared.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Poaceascoma, Massarinae LSU SSU and RPB2 RAxML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_86483.phy"}]}
