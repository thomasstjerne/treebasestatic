During a recent survey of chytrids of\nTuscaloosa County, Alabama, we isolated a putatively novel species in\nthe genus Triparticalcar from herbivore dung. We examined the strains\n(WJD101, WJD156) with light and transmission electron microscopy and\ncompared them to the type species T. articum. We also analyzed partial\nnuc 28S rDNA D1-D2 domains (28S) and nuc rDNA regions encompassing the\ninternal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and 5.8S (ITS) to determine the\nphylogenetic placement of the cultures within a broader sampling of\nSpizellomycetales. Our molecular phylogeny confirmed that the two\nisolates belong to a novel phylogenetic species within Triparticalcar.\nThe two isolates are distinguishable from the type by the development\nand morphology of their rhizoids and we describe the new species as T.\nequi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spizellomycetales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95089.phy"}]}
