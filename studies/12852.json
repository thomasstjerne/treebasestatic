The new\nphylogenetic hypothesis, based on both fossil and extant teleosts, shows\nthat Pholidophorus bechei is more primitive than Leptolepis\ncoryphaenoides, which in turn is more primitive than Tharsis and member\nsof the Varasichthyidae; the Ichthyodectiformes are more advanced than\nAscalabos. The Ichthyodectiformes are the plesiomorphic sister-group of\nthe elopomorphs plus the osteoglossomorphs and more advanced teleosts.\nThe osteoglossomorphs are the sister-group of two main clupeocephalan\nclades: one composed of the clupeomorphs and the ostariophysans and\nanother of the “salmoniforms”. The monophyly of Teleostei is supported\nby one uniquely derived character (quadrate bearing an elongated\nposteroventral process) and numerous homoplastic characters (e.g.,\nmobile premaxilla, pectoral propterygium fused with first pectoral ray,\nuroneurals). The sister-group relationship of Teleostei remains unknown\nbecause Dapedium, Pachycormidae, Mesturus, Aspidorhynchidae, Amia, and\n[Lepisosteus + Obaichthys] change their positions depending of the\nselection of the outgroups. The present study demonstrates that the\nphylogenetic hypotheses of Teleostei can be changed drastically by\nchanging the members of the outgroup. Following the new phylogenetic\nhypothesis the supercohorts Elopomorpha and Osteoglossocephala, the\nsubcohort Ostarioclupeomorpha, the cohort Clupeocephala, and subcohort\nEuteleostei sensu ARRATIA (1997), are redefined in a more complete set\nof characters. These taxa are defined at the primitive level by few\nuniquely derived characters and several homoplasies. This reflects the\nproblem that teleostean phylogenies face when data from both fossil and\nextant taxa are considered in phylogenetic analyses. The addition of new\noutgroup members (e.g., Watsonulus, the lepisosteid Obaichthys, the\npycnodont Mesturus) as well as new characters and new interpretations of\ncertain characters changes previous hypotheses of relationships of\nteleosts. The inclusion of basal teleosts in an analysis of\ninterrelationships changes the polarity of characters; consequently, the\nfossil basal teleosts influence the sister-group relationships of extant\ngroups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 20+","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53550","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53550.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 21+","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53551","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53551.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 25+","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 23+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53552","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 24+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53553","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 19+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53549","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 26+","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr53555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_53555.phy"}]}
