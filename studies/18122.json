In this study, collections of Diaporthe from several woody\nhosts in Italy and Thailand and grapevine in Guangxi and Hubei Provinces\nin China were identified based on morphological characters and analyses\nof ITS, EF1-α, β-tubulin and CAL gene sequence data. Two new species of\nDiaporthe, D. aseana and D. garethjonesii were identified on dead leaves\nfrom Thailand. Nine known species including Diaporthe biconispora, D.\neres, D. eucalyptorum, D. foeniculina, D. fraxini-angustifoliae, D.\nmahothocarpus, D. oncostoma, D. siamensis and D. sojae were studied from\nChina, Italy and Thailand. For the first time, D. fraxini-angustifoliae\nand D. mahothocarpus were reported from China, and from grapevine\nworldwide. Most of the Diaporthe species were found on only one host,\nwith the exception of D. oncostoma which was isolated from Clematis and\nRobinia species in Italy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89867","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89867.phy"}]}
