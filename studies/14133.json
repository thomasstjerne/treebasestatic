Ascomatal morphology\nof this fungus is similar to other marine Dactylospora species while the\nunique feature of the new fungus is a distinct perispore forming an\nascospore appendage, which comprises a thick and hyaline sheath\nconnected at the septum and open at both ends. Dactylospora vrijmoediae\nis described as new to science and illustrated. A phylogenetic analysis\nof the partial nuclear SSU and LSU rRNA and RPB2 genes groups D.\nvrijmoediae with the marine species D. haliotrepha, D. mangrovei and the\nterrestrial Sclerococcum sphaerale in an unnamed clade in the\nEurotiomycetes. The marine Dactylospora species are distantly located\nfrom the terrestrial Dactylospora species included in the analysis (D.\nlobariella, D. imperfecta) but this needs confirmation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE 1000","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dactylospora","tree_kind":"Species
