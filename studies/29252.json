However, little is known\nabout Colletotrichum as endophytes in Citrus grandis in China. In the\npresent study, ten endophytic Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from\ncultivated C. grandis cv. ‘Tomentosa’ in Huazhou, Guangdong Province in\n2019. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS),\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), chitin synthase 1\n(chs-1), actin (act), and beta-tubulin (β-tubulin) gene regions were\nsequenced and employed to construct phylogenetic trees. Based on\nmorphology and combined multigene phylogeny, six Colletotrichum species\nwere identified with two new species, Colletotrichum guangdongense and\nC. tomentosae. In addition, C. asianum, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and\nC. tainanense are identified as first reports on C. grandis. This study\nprovides the first comprehensive study on endophytic Colletotrichum\nspecies on C. grandis cv. “Tomentosa” in China. These results will\nimprove the current knowledge of Colletotrichum species associated with\nC. grandis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135090","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135090.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135089","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135089.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135091.phy"}]}
