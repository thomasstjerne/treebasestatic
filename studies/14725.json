We\nemploy an expanded sampling of taxa and markers and a rigorous analytic\napproach to address these limitations. We evaluate the roles of\ngeography and ecology in stimulating the initial radiation of the group\nand in its subsequent dispersal across the Southern Hemisphere. Methods:\nA dated tree was reconstructed using reversible-jump MCMC with a\npolytomy prior and molecular dating, applied to data from two nuclear\nand three cpDNA regions. Ancestral areas and habitats were inferred\nusing dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models. Key results: Schoeneae\noriginated in Australia in the Palæocene. The existence of a “hard”\npolytomy at the base of the clade reflects the rapid divergence of six\nprincipal lineages ca. 50 Ma within Australia. From this ancestral area,\nSchoeneae have traversed the austral oceans with remarkable frequency, a\ntotal of 29 distinct dispersal events reported here. Dispersal rates\nbetween landmasses are not explicable by the geographical distances\nseparating them. Transoceanic dispersal generally involved habitat\nstasis. Conclusions: Although the role of dispersal in explaining global\ndistribution patterns is now widely accepted, the apparent ease with\nwhich such dispersal may occur has perhaps been under-appreciated. In\nSchoeneae, transoceanic dispersal has been remarkably frequent, with\necological opportunity, rather than geography, being most important in\ndictating dispersal patterns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schoeneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66766.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schoeneae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66765.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66773","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66773.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66772","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66772.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66771.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66770","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66770.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66769","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66769.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66767","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66767.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66768","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66768.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66777","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66777.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66776","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66776.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66775","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66775.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66780","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66780.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66779.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66781","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66781.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66783","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66783.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66782","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66782.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66778.phy"},{"tree_label":"UnnamedTree","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66774","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66774.phy"}]}
