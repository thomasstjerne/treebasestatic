It has had a vexed taxonomic history,\nvariously being lumped with all the species in Phalacrocorax, being\naccorded its own genus, Nannopterum, or being included in Leucocarbo or\nCompsohalieus. Different authorities have similarly suggested a number\nof different species as being its closest relative. Here we use novel\nmitochondrial DNA sequence data to show that the Galápagos Cormorant is\nrelated to the sister pair of the mainland Americas, the Doublecrested\nCormorant, P. auritus, and the Neotropic Cormorant, P. brasilianus. This\ntrio of species has high statistical support (Bayesian posterior\nprobability of 1.00; NJ bootstrap 98%; MP bootstrap 91%). The Galápagos\nCormorant is thus a relatively recent offshoot of the mainland form,\nwhich has subsequently evolved flightlessness. Until the phylogeny of\nthe cormorants is more clearly resolved, we recommend the continued use\nof Phalacrocorax for all species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Galápagos Cormorant.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6733.phy"}]}
