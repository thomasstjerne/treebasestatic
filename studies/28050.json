Currently the genus comprises seven species. A further species\nof Mendogia was collected from the leaves of Fagales in Thailand.\nMorphological characteristics and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses using\nSSU, LSU and ITS sequences showed that the fungus is new to science,\ndescribed herein as Mendogia diffusa. Mendogia diffusa is characterized\nby apothecial ascostromata, a carbonized epithecium, dark brown setae on\nthe ascostromatal surface, hyaline paraphysoids, ovoid to clavate asci,\nand oblong to elliptical, muriform ascospores. The fungus has a dark\npigmented surface, and is occasionally facultative, associated with\npatches of green algae, but not actually lichenized. Instead, the fungus\npenetrates the upper leaf surface, forming dark pigmented isodiametric\ncells below the epidermis. A re-examination of specimens of M.\nchiangraiensis, M. macrostroma and M. yunnanensis revealed the absence\nof algal association. Comprehensive descriptions with phylogenetic\nanalyses support M. diffusa as a novel species in Myriangiaceae. An\nupdated key to the genus is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130081.phy"}]}
