Two isolates consistent with that genotype were subsequently\nisolated in culture. Examination of records in GenBank revealed that a\ngenetically similar fungus had been isolated previously as an endophyte\nof moss in a pine forest in the southwestern USA. These three isolates\nwere characterized using morphological and multi-locus molecular data\n(18S, ITS, 28S rRNA sequences). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that the\ntaxon represents a novel lineage in the Mucoromycotina. The fungus is\ndimorphic, grows best at room temperature, and presents epihyphal\nbacteria including Bacillus licheniformis and Stenotrophomonas sp. Here\na new taxon is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98220","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98220.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98219","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98219.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98216","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98216.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98217.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98218","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98218.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98221","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98221.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98222","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98222.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98223.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98224.phy"}]}
