We tested the monophyly of the\ntropical clade and its major genera using DNA sequences from the nuclear\n(internal transcribed spacer) and chloroplast (rpl16, trnT-L) genomes.\nThe tropical clade was strongly supported as monophyletic in all\nanalyses, and four main clades were recovered. The earliest diverging\nlineage within the tropical clade is comprised of the shrubby genera\nAsepalum and Cyclocheilon, previously placed within Cyclocheilaceae. The\natypical holoparasitic Alectra alba was shown to belong within the\nprimarily holoparasitic Harveya, and the hemiparasitic Harveya\nobtusifolia was shown to belong to an otherwise holoparasitic lineage\nwithin Harveya. Both New World Melasma species were included here for\nthe first time, and these were shown to be more closely related to the\nneotropical hemiparasitic Escobedia than the African Melasma lineage.\nThese results support a previous study recognizing Nesogenes within the\ntropical clade of Orobanchaceae rather than the separate family\nNesogenaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML best tree","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropical Clade of Orobanchaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6373.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6334","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6334.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6335","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6335.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6336","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6336.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6337","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6337.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6338","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6338.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6339","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6339.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6340","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6340.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6341","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6341.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6342","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6342.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6343","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6343.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6344","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6344.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6345","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6345.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6346","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6346.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6348","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6348.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6350","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6350.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6351","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6351.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict Cons of 18 MPT","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropical Clade of Orobanchaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6352.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6347","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6347.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6349","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6349.phy"}]}
