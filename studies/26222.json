The sequenced mitochondrial\ngenome size was 17,060â€‰bp, possessing identical gene order of 13\nprotein-coding genes (PGCs) to those of the congeneric freshwater\nspecies Diaphanosoma dubium in the genus Diaphanosoma. The mitochondrial\ngenome of D. celebensis had 13 PGCs, two rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs. Of 13\nPGCs, three genes (CO3, ND3, and ND4) had incomplete stop codons.\nFurthermore, the stop codons of the remaining ten PGCs were TAA (for\nCO1, ATP8, ATP6, ND5, ND6, and ND1) and TAG (for NL4L, Cytb, and ND2).\nThe second and third base composition of codon on 9 PCGs on the L strand\nin D. celebensis mitogenome showed an anti-G bias (11.0% and 15.0%),\nrespectively.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaphanosoma celebensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123491.phy"}]}
