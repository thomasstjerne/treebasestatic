The only species in the genus, it\nproduces distinctive ascomata that reoccur annually on wood and on the\nremains of its own previous fructifications, forming dense\nconglomerations of interlocking longitudinally elongated apothecia with\ngray hymenia. Known collections and references of A. rufescens indicate\nthat it is endemic to Eastern and Central United States. Morphological\nand cultural characters are described with notes on ascomatal\ndevelopment. No mitospores were observed in field collections or in\nculture. Lectotypes are designated herein for Hysterium rufescens and\nits synonym Ascobolus conglomeratus. Angelina rufescens is illustrated\nhere for the first time in the taxonomic literature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Angelina LSU+mtSSU NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87860.phy"}]}
