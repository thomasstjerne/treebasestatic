Compared to the outgroup\n(Calylophus), it is clearly defined by three synapomorphies: indehiscent\nfruits, four-lobed stigmas, and fruits with fewer than 10 seeds. A\ncladistic analysis of the genus was performed using 20 characters from\nfloral morphology, fruit morphology, and plant habit and growth\ncharacteristics. Polarity of the characters was based on the outgroup\ncomparison method. Two most parsimonious cladograms, with only a single\nminor topological difference, were generated, with 29 steps and a\nconsistency index of 0.72. A Nelson consensus tree was constructed,\nwhich has the same length as the two cladograms, and an identical\ntopology to one of them. The consensus cladogram defines 12 monophyletic\ngroups. This cladogram supports most of the current infrageneric\nclassification of Gaura, except that sects. Xerogaura and Gaura appear\nto be paraphyletic groups. The placement of G. lindheimeri within sect.\nGaura in keeping with the current classification depends on interpreting\ntwo habit characters in this species as being secondarily derived.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Guara","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1660.phy"}]}
