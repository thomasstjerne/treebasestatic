Both species are\nplaced in subgenus Lactarius based on an accurate study of macro- and\nmicromorphological features and supported by molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses of a single nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS), a concatenated ITS,\nD1, and D2 domains of nuc 28S rDNA (28S), and part of the second largest\nsubunit of the RNA polymerase II (rpb2) (67 region) sequence datasets.\nIn the phylogenetic reconstruction presented, the two species appear\nnested in two clearly distinct, well supported clades that reveal their\nphylogenetic position among members of subgenus Lactarius (5 subg.\nPiperites s. auct.), a complex group of which a worldwide phylogeny\nrequires further study. According to field observations, both taxa are\npossible ectomycorrhizal associates of Quercus spp. and one of Fagus\ngrandifolia var. mexicana. Taxonomic descriptions based on the study of\nspecimens gathered during fieldwork from 2012 to 2014 are presented.\nDescriptions are accompanied with illustrations of macro and\nmicromorphological characters and a discussion of related species is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius acatlanensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106288.phy"}]}
