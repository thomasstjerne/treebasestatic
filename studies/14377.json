However, delimitating species remains challenging in\nevolutionary radiations where morphological diversification is rapid and\naccompanied by little genetic differentiation or when genetic lineage\ndivergence is not accompanied by morphological change. We investigate\nthe utility of a variety of recently developed approaches to examine\ngenetic and morphological diversity, and delimit species in a\nmorphologically conserved group of Southeast Asian lizards. We find that\nspecies diversity is vastly underestimated in this unique evolutionary\nradiation, and find an extreme case where extensive genetic divergence\namong lineages has been accompanied by little to no differentiation in\nexternal morphology. Although we note that different conclusions can be\ndrawn when species are delimited using molecular phylogenetics,\ncoalescent-based methods, or morphological data, it is clear that the\nuse of a pluralistic approach leads to a more comprehensive appraisal of\nbiodiversity, and greater appreciation for processes of diversification\nin this biologically important geographic region. Similarly, our\napproach demonstrates how recently developed methodologies can be\nutilized to obtain robust estimates of species limits in “non-adaptive”\nor “cryptic” evolutionary radiations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0+","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64613.phy"},{"tree_label":"FullConcatenated","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64607.phy"},{"tree_label":"NuclearConcatenated","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64608.phy"},{"tree_label":"ATPSB+","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64610.phy"},{"tree_label":"LDHA+","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64609.phy"},{"tree_label":"FOXP2+","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64611.phy"},{"tree_label":"SELT+","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64612.phy"},{"tree_label":"NAT15","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64614","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64614.phy"},{"tree_label":"ND2","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64615","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64615.phy"}]}
