Recent simulations show\nthat tree shapes also play an important role in determining the\nmagnitude of PD loss, potentially offsetting the effects of clustered\nextinctions. While patterns of PD loss under different extinction\nscenarios are becoming well characterized in model phylogenies, analyses\nof real clades that often have unbalanced tree shapes remain scarce,\nparticularly for marine organisms. Here, we use a fossil-calibrated\nphylogeny of all living scleractinian reef corals in conjunction with\nIUCN data on extinction vulnerabilities to quantify how loss of species\nin different threat categories will affect the PD of this group. Our\nanalyses reveal that predicted PD loss in corals varies substantially\namong different threats, with extinctions due to bleaching and disease\nhaving the largest negative effects on PD. In general, more\nphylogenetically clustered extinctions lead to larger losses of PD in\ncorals, but there are notable exceptions; extinction of rare corals from\ndistantly-related old and unique lineages can also result in substantial\nPD loss. Thus our results show that loss of PD in reef corals is\ndependent on both tree shape and the nature of extinction threats.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"977","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scleractinia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61953.phy"}]}
