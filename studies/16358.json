In this study, we introduce five new species\nwith similar micromorphological features, but were found to display\nunique macromorphological characters. Talaromyces australis (CBS\n137102T) is distinguished by its restricted growth on CYA at 25 and 37 \u0001C\n(16e24 mm; 9e13 mm) and red pigments produced on most media. Talaromyces\nkendrickii (CBS 136666T) is distinguished by its inability to grow on\nCYA at 37 \u0001C. Talaromyces veerkampii (CBS 500.78T) grows rapidly on MEA\n(38e42 mm) and colonies on YES has a bronze green reverse. Talaromyces\nfuscoviridis (CBS 193.69T) colonies have dark green reverses on MEA and\ncommonly produces red exudates on other media. Talaromyces\nstellenboschiensis (CBS 135665T) grows faster on CYA at 25, 30 and 37 \u0001C\n(40e45 mm; 48e53 mm; 35e40 mm) than the others. Morphological findings\nwere supported by both multigene phylogenetic analyses and the\nextrolites produced by these species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tverruculosus_BenA","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96604","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96604.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96605.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96606.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tverruculosus_CaM","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96607.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96609","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tverruculosus_ITS","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96610","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96610.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96608.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96611.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96612.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tverruculosus_Concatenation","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96613.phy"}]}
