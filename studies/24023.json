Drawing upon the availability of recently\nsequenced fern and lycophyte genomes we investigated these dynamics and\nplaced them in the context of vascular plants. We found that similar to\nseed plants, mean LTR insertion dates were strongly correlated with\nhaploid nuclear genome size. Fern and lycophyte species with small\ngenomes such as those of the heterosporous Selaginella and members of\nthe Salviniaceae had recent mean LTR insertion dates, whereas species\nwith large genomes such as homosporous ferns had old mean LTR insertion\ndates intermediate between angiosperms and gymnosperms. This pattern\nholds despite methylation and life history differences in ferns and\nlycophytes compared to seed plants, and our results are consistent with\nother patterns of structural variation in fern and lycophyte\ngenomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rbcL ultrametric for PIC","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116135","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_116135.phy"}]}
