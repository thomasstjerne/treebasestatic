However,\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial and nuclear\nsequences of 20 genera of Helicidae unequivocally demonstrated that\nCepaea as currently understood is a polyphyletic assemblage. Only C.\nnemoralis and C. hortensis are retained in Cepaea, whereas C.\nvindobonensis is referred to Caucasotachea and C. sylvatica to Macularia\nbased on our molecular phylogeny. Cepaea and Macularia belong to the\nwestern clade of the Helicinae, whereas Caucasotachea is nested in the\neastern clade which probably diverged in the late Eocene. Because of the\nlarge phylogenetic distances between Cepaea, Macularia and\nCaucasotachea, it has to be shown whether the genetic mechanism\nunderlying the simpler banding polymorphism in C. vindobonensis and M.\nsylvatica is a simpler version of the supergene that determines the\npolymorphism in Cepaea in the strict sense. This case illustrates the\nimportance of sound phylogenetic analyses as a basis for any predictions\nin comparative biology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cepaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91045.phy"}]}
