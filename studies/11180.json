In\nthe present study, we demonstrate the close relatedness of two green\ncoccoid taxa that have undergone multiple taxonomic transfers in the\npast and we argue for the distinct character of the lineage they form.\nWe resurrect the genus Chromochloris and attempt to clarify its\nphylogenetic relationships to other chlorophyte genera, especially\nBracteacoccus, Chlorella, Muriella, Pseudomuriella, and Mychonastes. We\nsynonymize Bracteacoccus minutus with Chomochloris zofingiensis. In\naddition, we clarify the identity of three UTEX strains listed as\nBracteacoccus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 16","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chlorphyceae and Trebouxiophyceae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52466.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromochloris 18S rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52467.phy"}]}
