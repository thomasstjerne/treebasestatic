Problems of homology\nacross the family and its outgroups were encountered for several\ncharacters. A phylogenetic analysis, using only those characters for\nwhich we were fairly confident of our assessment of homology, was\nundertaken to establish broad relationships within the family as a basis\nfor a re-assessment of the supra-generic classification. The resultant\nphylogeny is weakly resolved and lacks robustness in the basal clades.\nPrevious classifications of the family are assessed in the light of this\nanalysis, and an alternative arrangement of four tribes is\nproposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epacridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1329.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epacridaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1330.phy"}]}
