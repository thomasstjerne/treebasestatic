These isolates were suspected to be hybrids. Three\nnuclear loci, the ITS region, two single copy loci (ASF and GPA) and one\nmitochondrial locus (coxI) were amplified and sequenced to validate this\nhypothesis. Abundant recombination within the ITS region was observed.\nThis, combined with phylogenetic comparisons of the other three loci,\nconfirmed the presence of four distinct hybrids involving the three\nknown parental species P. amnicola, P. thermophila and P. taxon\nPgChlamydo. In all cases, only a single coxI allele was obtained\nsuggesting that hybrids arose from sexual recombination. The hybrid\nspecies were sterile in culture and had physiological traits similar to\nthose of the maternal parents. Nothing is known regarding the host range\nor pathogenicity of these hybrids, but several isolates from Western\nAustralia were obtained from the rhizosphere soil of dying plants.\nRegardless of the unknown pathogenicity of these hybrids, they should be\nregarded as potential threats. Their serendipitous and simultaneous\ndiscovery on two continents is intriguing yet their broad geographic\ndistribution, frequent occurrence and their presence together with their\nparental strains in Australia strongly suggests an origin in this\ncountry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55105.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP 4","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55108.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP bootstrap","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55110.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP 5","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55109.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 MP 4","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids ASF-updated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55221.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 MP 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids GPA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55220.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 MP bootstrap consensus","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55217.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 MP 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55218.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 MP 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids COX","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55219.phy"},{"tree_label":"coxI MP bootstrap consensus","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55223.phy"},{"tree_label":"CoxI Bayesian inference","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55225.phy"},{"tree_label":"coxI MP 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55224.phy"},{"tree_label":"GPA1 Bayesian inference","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55222.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP 3","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids COX","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55107.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like MP 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids GPA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55106.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASF-like Bayesian inference","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora hybrids ASF-updated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55103.phy"}]}
