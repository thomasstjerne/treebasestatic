The most commonly reported species are C. amethystina, C.\ncinerea, C. coralloides, and C. rugosa, which form a species complex in\ntemperate ecosystems. In this work, we describe two new species for the\ngenus: C. mahiscolorata and C. parvispora; these species show great\nresemblance to previously described species. Nevertheless, they\nrepresent new lineages distributed in temperate forests from central\nMexico. We present a geographical range redistribution of C. reae, which\ndisplays great macro-morphological variation regarding basidiome\nbranching rank, colors, and tip shape. We provide macromorphological,\nmicromorphological, and habitat data for each species, as well as rDNA\nITS and LSU, and RPB2 sequences. Our findings highlight an\nunderestimation of richness in temperate ecosystems, as a consequence of\nmisallocation of common epithets to undescribed taxa. The designation of\nneotypes for temperate species of Clavulina is urgent, in order to\ndelimit species concepts for the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118606.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118607","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118607.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118608.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118605","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118605.phy"}]}
