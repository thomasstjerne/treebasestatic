The identification based on morphological and\nphysiological features was verified with molecular phylogenetic approach\nusing Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of nuclear (ITS\nand Btub) and mitochondrial (cox2) loci. Among the four new species,\nincluding Pythium banihashemianum, P. izadpanahii, P. kamfiruzense and\nP. rosarium, only P. izadpanahii didnÂ’t produce asexual structures such\nas vesicle and zoospores. All species belong to Clade B of ITS\nphylogenetic tree of Pythium species. These species were extremely\npathogenic on rice seedlings, except for P. izadpanahii, isolates. The\npresent paper describes the morphological characteristics of the new\nfour species as well as their phylogenetic relationships with other\nPythium species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium Rice isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118024.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium Rice isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118026.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium Rice isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118025.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium Rice isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118027.phy"}]}
