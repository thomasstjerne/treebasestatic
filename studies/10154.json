The western pond turtle (Emys\nmarmorata), is an example of a wide-ranging taxon that spans several\nwell-known California diversity hotspots. Using a dataset comprised of\none mitochondrial and five nuclear loci, we elucidate the major\nbiogeographic patterns of the western pond turtle across the California\nlandscape. By employing a combination of phylogenetic and network-based\napproaches, we recovered a relatively ancient (~2-8 mya) north/south\nsplit among populations of this species and find an area of\nintergradation centered in the Central Coast Ranges of California. In\naddition, discordant mitochondrial/nuclear genetic patterns suggest\nsubsequent gene flow from northern populations and from San Joaquin\nValley populations into the Central Coast Ranges after the\nPliocene-Pleistocene marine embayment of the Great Central Valley\nsubsided. Our results emphasize the utility of nuclear DNA\nphylogeography for recovering the impact of relatively ancient\nbiogeographic events, and suggest that the Central Coast Ranges of\nCalifornia have played a major role in the geographic structuring of the\nwestern pond turtle, and possibly other co-distributed taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ND4 Bayes","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, Bayes constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6551.phy"},{"tree_label":"ND4 ML","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, ML constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6669.phy"},{"tree_label":"ND4 Pofad","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, Pofad constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6507.phy"},{"tree_label":"POFAD nuDNA","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, Pofad constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6649.phy"},{"tree_label":"ND4 Splitstree","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, Splitstree constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6024.phy"},{"tree_label":"ND4 Subspecies","ntax":"152","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Western Pond Turtle, Subspecies constraint","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6367.phy"}]}
