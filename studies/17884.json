Here, we assess the genetic variation of existing\npopulations of this species, including new sampling sites and additional\nmolecular markers (newly developed microsatellite loci specific to\nEuropean mink) as compared to previous studies. Probabilistic analyses\nwere used to examine genetic structure within and between existing\npopulations, and to infer phylogeographic processes and past\ndemography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mustela lutreola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89140.phy"}]}
