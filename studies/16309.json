This study analyse the phylogenetic signal\namong Piptospatha species using nrITS and plastid matK regions. Eleven\naccessions representing 10 taxa (including the Type, P. insignis) of\nPiptospatha are included. Both gene regions are combined into a dataset\nof 2547 base pairs and analysed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nmethods. The analyses have conclusively established the separation of\nex-Bornean taxa from the Bornean Piptospatha. Here, we proposed to\ntransfer P. ridleyi, P. perakensis and P. teijsmannii into a new genus,\nKiewia S.Y.Wong. Flowering mechanism, pollination strategy, and fruitset\nof both Kiewia species are also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kiewia Combined ITS matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77889.phy"}]}
