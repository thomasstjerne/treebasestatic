We investigate the\ndeep-branching relationships among subfamilies of the Leguminosae (or\nFabaceae), the third largest angiosperm family. Despite their ecological\nand economic importance, a robust phylogenetic framework for legumes\nbased on genome-scale sequence data is lacking.  We generated alignments\nof 72 chloroplast genes and 7,621 homologous nuclear encoded proteins,\nfor 157 and 76 taxa, respectively. We analysed these with Maximum\nLikelihood, Bayesian Inference, and a multi-species coalescent summary\nmethod, and evaluated support for alternative topologies across gene\ntrees.  We resolve the deepest divergences in the legume phylogeny\ndespite lack of phylogenetic signal across all chloroplast genes and the\nmajority of nuclear genes. Strongly supported conflict in the remainder\nof nuclear genes is suggestive of incomplete lineage sorting.  All six\nsubfamilies originated nearly simultaneously, suggesting that the\nprevailing view of some subfamilies as “basal” or “early-diverging” with\nrespect to others should be abandoned, which has important implications\nfor understanding the evolution of legume diversity and traits. Our\nstudy highlights the limits to phylogenetic resolution in relation to\nrapid successive speciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"legs AA 2.3 excluded.con.tre.rooted","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae chloroplast gene results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120280.phy"},{"tree_label":"legs NT 2.3 excluded.con.tre.rooted","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae chloroplast gene results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120279.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipartitions.legs AA 2.3 LG4X\nrapidbootstrap.rooted","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae chloroplast gene results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120278.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bipartitions.legs NT 2.3 excluded\npartitioned","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae chloroplast gene results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120277.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASTRAL 1to1 pp","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae 1to1 nuclear orthologs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120329.phy"},{"tree_label":"1to1 cleaned jackknife","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae 1to1 nuclear orthologs results","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120328.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML bestTree.1to1 cleaned concatenated LG4X ICA","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leguminosae 1to1 nuclear orthologs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120327.phy"}]}
