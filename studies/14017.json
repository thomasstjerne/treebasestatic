Based on sequences from\ntheir type hosts, Peronospora dentariae, Peronospora\ncardamines-laciniatae, Peronospora dentariae-macrophyllae, Peronospora\nmalyi and Peronospora nasturtii-aquatici are combined into\nHyaloperonospora, and their circumscription is clarified.\nHyaloperonospora cardamines-enneaphyllos is described as a new species\nfrom Cardamine enneaphyllos. The host range of Hyaloperonospora\nnasturtii-aquatici, described from Nasturtium officinale, is shown to\nextend to various Cardamine species. Host range of species is shown to\nbe highly diagnostic, with no overlap in their host range, but species\ncommonly cannot be distinguished by morphology alone. Both cox1 and cox2\nare confirmed to be good barcode markers for species delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora on Cardamine ITS-LSU, cox1, cox2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72537.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora on Cardamine ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72536.phy"}]}
