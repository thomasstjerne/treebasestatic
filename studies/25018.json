The phylogenetic analysis\nbased on combined gene regions of Internal transcribed spacer (ITS),\nlarge subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA (LSU), beta-tubulin (TUB2) and\nthe second largest subunit of nuclear RNA polymerase II (RPB2) sequence\ndataset shows that species clusters within the genus Nothophoma.\nMorphological characteristics and phylogenetic results confirmed that\nthe fungus is Nothophoma quercina. Since this is the first report of N.\nquercina from Ulmus, we report this species as a new host record from\nUlmus minor × Ulmus pumila in Russia.
