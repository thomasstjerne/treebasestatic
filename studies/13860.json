It\nincludes wide-ranging circumboreal species, as well as endemics in\nEurasia and North America. It presents the rare opportunity to\ninvestigate diversification, character evolution, and biogeographical\nrelationships in a widespread temperate genus of aquatic monocots. We\npresent a fossil-calibrated, molecular phylogeny based on analysis of\ntwo chloroplast and two nuclear markers with extensive taxon sampling\nwithin Sparganium. Within this framework, we examine character evolution\nin both habit and stigma number; and infer the ancestral area and\nbiogeographic history of the genus. Methods Data from two cpDNA and two\nnDNA markers were analyzed using the programs BEAST, Lagrange, S-DIVA,\nand BayesTraits. BEAST was used to simultaneously estimate phylogeny and\ndivergence times, Lagrange and S-DIVA were used for biogeographical\nreconstruction, and BayesTraits was used to infer stigma number and\nhabit evolution. Key resultsTwo major Sparganium clades were recovered\nwith strong support: one composed of S. erectum and S. eurycarpum; and\nthe other containing all remaining Sparganium. We propose to realign the\nsubgenera to conform to these clades. Divergence time analysis suggests\na Miocene crown origin but Pliocene diversification. Importantly, the\nfloating-leaved habit has arisen multiple times in the genus, from\nemergent ancestors. ConclusionsCooling trends during the Tertiary\nresulted in the isolation of Eurasian and North American taxa, while\nepisodic glaciation and the rise of cool boreal climates in the Pliocene\nset the stage for multiple transitions to the floating growth form.\nVicariance, long-distance dispersal, and habitat specialization are key\nmechanisms for Sparganium diversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus tree of 24 trees from Sample Trees","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68911.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68909.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68913","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68913.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68914","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68914.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68912","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68912.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus of 312 trees","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sparganium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68915.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68910","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68910.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68916.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr68917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_68917.phy"}]}
