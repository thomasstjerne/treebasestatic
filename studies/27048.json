The quarantine rests on a product\ncertification based on the absence of symptoms but it was not known\nwhether the pathogen could be moving around in quiescent infections. In\nthis work, we detected N. ditissima after incubation of asymptomatic\ncommercial fruit. The identity of the pathogen was confirmed using\nmorphological and molecular tools, and Koch’s postulates were fulfilled\non ‘Gala’ apples. We demonstrated that fruit are weak links in\nquarantine efforts. Fruit stored at low temperatures can have quiescent\nN. ditissima infections, which may develop rapidly with abundant\nsporulation when exposed to more suitable conditions, as those of\ncommercialization. Revised management strategies for flower and fruit\ntreatment, as well as studies on efficient detection methods, are\nstrongly recommended. This is the first report of N. ditissima quiescent\ninfections in commercial apple fruit in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neonectria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130600.phy"}]}
