Brasilotyphlus dubium sp. nov. differs from all\nother congeners in having a combination of 123-129 primary annuli and\n9-16 secondary annular grooves. The first molecular data were generated\nand analysed for Brasilotyphlus, and the genus was recovered as\nmonophyletic and nested within a paraphyletic Microcaecilia. The extent\nof genetic and taxon sampling, and levels of phylogenetic support are\nnot considered sufficient enough to place Brasilotyphlus in the synonymy\nof Microcaecilia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree from 16s cytb Bayesian","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112495","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112495.phy"}]}
