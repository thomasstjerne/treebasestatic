Here we\nprovide a molecular phylogeny of this poorly understood taxon using\ncombined analyses of mitochondrial (CYTB, COII, 12S, 16S) and nuclear\n(KCAS, SPTBN1, PRKCI, MC1R, THYR) genes. We explore the influence of\ndata partitioning and different analytical methods, including Bayesian\ninference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony, on the inferred\nrelationships within Antilopini. We achieve increased resolution and\nsupport compared to previous analyses especially in the two most\nproblematic parts of their tree. First, taxa commonly referred to as\nâgazellesâ are recovered as paraphyletic, as the genus Gazella appears\nmore closely related to the Indian blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) than\nto the other two gazelle genera (Nanger and Eudorcas). Second, we\nrecovered a strongly supported sister relationship between one of the\ndwarf antelopes (Ourebia) and the Antilopini subgroup Antilopina (Saiga,\nGerenuk, Springbok, Blackbuck and gazelles). The assessment of the\ninfluence of taxon sampling, outgroup rooting, and data partitioning in\nBayesian analyses helps explain the contradictory results of previous\nstudies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini PAUP reduced taxon set MP2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53753.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini, RAxML allgenes full taxon set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53759.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Antilopini, PAUP ingroup only MP2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53757.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP MP2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini, PAUP full taxon set MP2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53761.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini PAUP reduced taxon set MP1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53752.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini RAxML allgenes reduced taxon set","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53751.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini MrBayes allgenes mit6 nucl6 reduced taxon\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53750.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP MP3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini, PAUP full taxon set MP3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53762.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Antilopini, PAUP ingroup only MP1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53756.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini, MrBayes allgenes mit6 nucl6 full taxon\nset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53758.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Antilopini, RAxML allgenes ingroup only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53755.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Antilopini, MrBayes allgenes mit6 nucl6 ingroup\nonly","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53754.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP MP1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopini, PAUP full taxon set MP1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53760.phy"}]}
