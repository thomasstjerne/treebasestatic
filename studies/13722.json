Meiotic and mitotic chromosome\nobservations of Mankyua show n = 130 and 2n = ca. 260, suggesting that\nthe base number of this genus is x = 130, which is a new finding and the\nhighest base number reported so far for Ophioglossaceae. The molecular\nphylogenetic trees derived from nucleotide sequence variation of rbcL\nand matK genes differ in terms of the phylogenetic position of Mankyua.\nThe molecular phylogenetic trees based on matK, which show higher\nbootstrap values or posterior probabilities than those of rbcL, suggest\nthat Mankyua might be the sister group of the clade comprised of\nHelminthostachys and Ophioglossum s. l.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophioglossaceae matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60058.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophioglossaceae matK + rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60059.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophioglossaceae rbcL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60060.phy"}]}
