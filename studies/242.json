Alternative interpretations of morphological\nhomologies are variously consistent with proposals that species of\nAlismatanae, Dioscoreales, or Melanthiales were the earliest descendants\nof the first monocotyledons. We present phylogenetic analyses based on\nDNA sequences of the plastid locus rbcL in which Acurs calamus, an herb\nwith unspecialized floral features and of uncertain affinities, is\nsupported as a member of the oldest extant lineage of monocotyledons.\nThis conclusion is consistent with a substantial body of morphological,\nanatomical, and embyrological evidence and offers an explanation for the\nfailure to identify any close relationship between Acorus and other\ngenera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"monocotyledons","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_267.phy"}]}
