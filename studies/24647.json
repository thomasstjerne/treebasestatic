The fungus infected\novaries of most flowers of host plants. Infected flowers were filled\nwith yellow to orange thick- walled conidia that became olivaceous green\nat maturity. However, multilocus phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences\n(18S, 28S, translation elongation factor 1α [TEF], the largest [RPB1]\nand the second largest [RPB2] subunit of RNA polymerase II) showed that\nthe fungus belonged to the tribe Ustilaginoideae (Clavicipitaceae,\nHypocreales, Ascomycota). Microscopic examination showed that the fungus\ndeveloped conidia at the apex of conidiogenous cells, in contrast to\nother species in the Ustilaginoideae that develop conidia\npleurogenously. A new genus, Commelinaceomyces, is formally proposed in\nthe Ustilaginoideae to accommodate this fungus. Four species previously\nmisplaced in Ustilago (Ustilaginales, Basidiomycota) are transferred to\nCommelinaceomyces, including the type of the genus, C. aneilematis, on\nMurdannia keisak. This is the first report of a clavicipitaceous species\ninfecting host plants in the Commelinaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Commelinaceomyces 5 genes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125096.phy"}]}
