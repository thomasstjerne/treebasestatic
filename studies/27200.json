Both species are characterized by white and\ngelatinous basidiocarps with poroid hymenophore which concolorous with\nthe pileal surface, a monomitic hyphal system with slightly thick-walled\ntramal hyphae. P. bambusicola has oblong ellipsoid to ellipsoid\nbasidiospores measuring 67.2 × 33.8 µm, whereas P. yunnanensis has\nellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 6.58.5 × 3.84.5\nμm. In addition, samples of P. bambusicola and P. yunnanensis formed two\ndistinct phylogenetic lineages based on the internal transcribed spacer\nregions (ITS) and nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA gene regions\n(nLSU) sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panellus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129721.phy"}]}
