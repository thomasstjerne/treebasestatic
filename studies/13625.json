To identify genetic\nchanges associated with the development of these traits, we performed\nwhole genome sequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly\nrelated bat species, fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous Myotis\ndavidii. We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively\nselected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and NF-ÎºB pathways that may\nbe related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction\nof gene families relevant to innate immunity. Comparison of bat genomes\nwith other mammalian species has provided new insight into bat biology\nand evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58474","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58474.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58475","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58475.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58636","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58636.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58637","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58637.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58620","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58620.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58621","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58621.phy"}]}
