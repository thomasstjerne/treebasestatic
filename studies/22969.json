The genus is restricted to\n25 species with semitranslucent, gelatinous basidiocarps lacking\ndifferentiated cystidia and clamps on hyphae, of which 11 are described\nas new to science. The asexual genus Leucogloea is placed as a synonym\nof Helicogloea s.str. Since the type species of Saccoblastia, S.\novispora, is combined to Helicogloea, a new genus, Saccosoma, is\nintroduced to encompass Saccoblastia farinacea and six related species,\none of which is described as new. In contrast to Helicogloea in the\nstrict sense, the basidiocarps of Saccosoma are arid, not gelatinized,\nand hyphae are clamped. The third lineage of the corticioid\nAtractiellomycetes is represented by the Bourdotigloea vestita complex.\nSpecies of Bourdotigloea are devoid of clamps but often possess\nwell-differentiated cystidia, as well as long, cylindrical-fusiform\nbasidiospores. Bourdotigloea encompasses nine species, of which six are\ndescribed here as new.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Atractiellomycetes ITS-LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118180.phy"}]}
