Although LCP proteins have\nbeen studied in other pathogens, their functions in enterococci remain\nuncharacterized. The Psr protein from Enterococcus hirae, here renamed\nLcpA, previously associated with the regulation of the expression of the\nlow-affinity PBP5 and β-lactam resistance, has been characterized.\nRESULTS: LcpA protein of E. hirae ATCC 9790 has been produced and\npurified with and without its transmembrane helix. LcpA appears, through\ndifferent methods, to be localized in the membrane, in agreement with in\nsilico predictions. The interaction of LcpA with E. hirae cell wall\nindicates that LcpA binds enterococcal peptidoglycan, regardless of the\npresence of secondary cell wall polymers. Immunolocalization experiments\nshowed that LcpA and PBP5 are localized at the division site of E.\nhirae. CONCLUSIONS: LcpA belongs to the LytR-CpsA-Psr family. Its\ntopology, localization and binding to peptidoglycan support, together\nwith previous observations on defective mutants, that LcpA plays a role\nrelated to the cell wall metabolism, probably acting as a\nphosphotransferase catalyzing the attachment of cell wall polymers to\nthe peptidoglycan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterococcus hirae LcpA (Psr)","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98371.phy"}]}
