Sequences of ITS and nLSU rRNA markers of the studied\nsamples were employed, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference methods.\nBoth datasets analyses showed that two new species clustered into genus\nRhizochaete, in which based on ITS+nLSU dataset, R. fissurata was sister\nto R. belizensis, and R. grandinosa grouped with R. radicata; the\nphylogram inferred from ITS sequences inside Rhizochaete indicated that\nR. fissurata formed a monophyletic lineage with a lower supports; R.\ngrandinosa grouped closely with R. radicata. In addition, an\nidentification key to the all Rhizochaete worldwide is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
