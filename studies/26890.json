In this study we use genomic data from\nnatural history collections to estimate the geographic origins and\ngenetic diversity of this economically and culturally important crop in\nthe context of its wild relatives. Our phylogeographic analyses clearly\ndemonstrate the four varieties of coca comprise two or three exclusive\ngroups nested within the diverse lineages of the widespread, wild\nspecies E. gracilipes; establishing a new and robust hypothesis of\ndomestication wherein coca originated two or three times from this wild\nprogenitor. The Colombian and Trujillo coca varieties are descended from\na single, ancient domestication event in northwestern South America.\nHuánuco coca was domesticated more recently, possibly in southeastern\nPeru. Amazonian coca either shares a common domesticated ancestor with\nHuánuco coca, or it was the product of a third and most recent\nindependent domestication event in the western Amazon basin. This\nchronology of coca domestication reveals different Holocene peoples in\nSouth America were able to independently transform the same natural\nresource to serve their needs; in this case, a workaday stimulant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125672.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125670.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125673","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125673.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125668.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125669.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125674","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125674.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125675","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125675.phy"},{"tree_label":"iTOL exported tree","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125671.phy"}]}
