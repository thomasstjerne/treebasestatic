They were isolated from raffinate which were typically very\nacidic (pH 1.71.8) and contained high concentrations of total\ndissolved/colloidal salts (>100 g/L). Five of the isolates correspond\nto two new acidotolerant Ascomycota fungi. The first is a member of a\nnew genus, here described as Fodinomyces (Teratosphaeriaceae,\nCapnodiales, Dothideomycetes) and does not show clear close affiliation\nwith any other described fungus in the scientific literature. The second\nbelongs to the genus Coniochaeta (Coniochaetaceae, Coniochaetales,\nSordariomycetes) and is closely related to Coniochaeta hansenii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaeta LSU MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68229.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coniochaeta ITS MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68227.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"151","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeriaceae LSU MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68230.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Teratosphaeriaceae ITS MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75536.phy"}]}
