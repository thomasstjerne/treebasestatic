These fungi are considered a\nsignificant threat to coniferous forests, which has resulted in numerous\nstudies characterising the diversity of bark beetles and their\nophiostomatoid associates globally. The diversity of ophiostomatoid\nfungi present in Australian pine plantations, however, remains largely\nundetermined. The aims of this study were therefore to reconsider the\ndiversity of ophiostomatoid fungi associated with Pinus in Australia,\nand to establish the baseline of expected taxa found within these\necosystems. In order to achieve this, we reviewed the collections lodged\nin Australian herbaria, and carried out a targeted survey from the major\npine growing regions in south eastern Australia. In total, 135\nophiostomatoid isolates (15 from herbaria and 120 collected during the\ncurrent study) were assessed using morphological identification and ITS\nscreening which putatively distinguished 15 taxonomic groups. Whole\ngenome sequencing (WGS) of representative isolates from each taxon was\nperformed in order to obtain high-quality sequence data for multi-locus\nphylogenetic analysis. Our results revealed a greater than expected\ndiversity, expanding the status of ophiostomatoid fungi associated with\nPinus in Australia to include 15 species from six genera in the\nOphiostomatales and a single species residing in the Microascales. While\nmost of these were already known to science, our study includes seven\nfirst records for Australia and the description of one new species,\nGraphilbum ipis-grandicollis sp. nov.. This study also provides an early\nexample of whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches replacing\ntraditional PCR-based methods for taxonomic surveys. This not only\nallowed for robust multi-locus sequence extraction during taxonomic\nassessment, but also permitted the rapid establishment of a curated\ngenomic database for ophiostomatoid fungi which will continue to aid in\nthe development of improved diagnostic resources and capabilities for\nAustralian biosecurity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1
