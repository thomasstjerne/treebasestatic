Two independent data sets were examined;\none based on multiple genes and analyzed using both supertree and\nsupermatrix approaches, and a second being a supertree constructed from\ntrees collected from the scientific literature. All methods broadly\nconfirmed the traditional view of perissodactyl interfamily\nrelationships, with Equidae (= Hippomorpha) forming the sister-group to\nthe clade Rhinocerotidae + Tapiridae (= Ceratomorpha). The contentious\naffinity of the Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is resolved in\nfavour of it forming a clade with the two Asian rhinos (genus\nRhinoceros). However, no data set or tree-building method managed to\nsatisfactorily resolve the historically contentious relationships among\nextant equids; little agreement appears among the different trees for\nthis group. In general, both the supertree and supermatrix approaches\nperformed equally well, but both were hindered by the current paucity of\ndata (e.g.Â no single gene has been sequenced to date for all 17 species)\nand its patchy distribution within Equidae. More data, both molecular\nand morphological, are required for all species to resolve the poorly\nsupported nodes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3191.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3186.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3187.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2d","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3188.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2e","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3189.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3190.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3183.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Perissodactyla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3184.phy"}]}
