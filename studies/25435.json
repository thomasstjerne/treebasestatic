These forests present regionally unique habitats\nfor symbiotic ECM fungi, and one of the most species rich families\npresent is Russulaceae. A long-term sampling program in forests in\nGuyanas Pakaraima Mountains has revealed a number of species of\nLactifluus, two of which are described here: Lactifluus pruinolamellatus\nsp. nov. and Lactifluus barbapapa sp. nov. Lactifluus pruinolamellatus\nis characterized by its orange basidiomata with strongly pruinose\nlamellae, mild taste, broadly ellipsoid spores with a low ornamentation\nforming an incomplete reticulum, scarce pleuromacrocystidia measuring 80\nx 9 μm on average, and palisadic structure of the pileipellis.\nLactifluus barbapapa is characterized by its pleurotoid habit, white to\ncream basidiomata which stain brown, subglobose to broadly ellipsoid\nspores with reticulate ornamentation up to 0.3 µm high and a completely\namyloid plage, the absence of pleuromacrocystidia, and the\nlampropalisadic structure of the pileipellis, with hair-shaped,\nirregularly clavate and irregularly globose terminal elements\npresent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactifluus ITS rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121659.phy"}]}
