This species is\ncharacterized by yellowish to brownish pileus surface, indistinct umbo\nof pileus center, marginated lamellae, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid\nbasidiospores, short basidia, colorless cells on the lamellar edge, and\nsmall chlamidospore-like terminal cells in volval surface. Similar\nspecies, A. rubromarginata, A. chatamagotake, A. kitamagotake, and A.\njavanica were morphologically distinct from A. ishigakiensis.\nPhylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and\nlarge subunit (LSU) regions of fungal ribosomal RNA gene, translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (tef-1) region, and RNA polymerase II subunit\nII (rpb2) supported that A. ishigakiensis is distinct from any\npreviously described species of sect. Caesareae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107111","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107111.phy"}]}
