Since\nthere is little information about aetiology of these diseases and given\nthe high ecological and economic importance of these agro-systems, from\nautumn 2012 to spring 2014, sixty samples of twigs and branches of\nhazelnut trees showing exudates and different types of canker (sunken\nwith wedge-shaped necrotic sector, open canker and Cytospora canker)\nwere collected in the main hazelnut growing area in the centre of the\nisland. Based on morphology, colony appearance and DNA sequence data,\nseven species belonging to four genera and three families were isolated\nand identified. These included Diplodia sapinea, D. seriata, Dothiorella\niberica, Do. parva and Do. symphoricarposicola (Botryosphaeriaceae),\nGnomoniopsis smithogilvyi (Gnomoniaceae) and Anthostoma decipiens\n(Diatrypaceae). In addition, two new species namely Diaporthella\ncryptica sp. nov. and Dothiorella omnivora sp. nov. are described.\nPathogenicity trials carried out on wounded hazelnut branches showed\nthat three species, Anthostoma decipiens, Diaporthella cryptica and\nDiplodia seriata are aggressive pathogens on hazelnut. Results obtained\nhave allowed us to clarify, almost a century after its first\ndescription, the aetiology of the disease known as Cytospora canker of\nhazelnut and to reveal the existence of three evolutionarily distinct\nlineages for its causal agent A. decipiens. Finally, the diversity of\nfungal pathogens associated with twig and branch cankers of hazelnut is\ngreater than previously recognised and further studies are necessary to\ndetermine the exact role played by each species and their possible\nsynergistic interaction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella MPT","tree_kind":"Species
