Strains were analysed using nuclear-encoded sequence markers\nand morphometric parameters of their silica frustules. Valves of all\nstrains show a sternum with striae perpendicular thereupon, typical for\npennate diatoms. They possess apical pore fields and lack a raphe,\ntypical for araphids, but also rimoportulae and areola occlusions.\nSequence comparison of both the SSU rDNA and the D1/D2 region of the LSU\nrDNA revealed that the strains group into three markedly distinct\ngenotypes. The strains from different genotypes are also distinguishable\nby a principal component analysis using four morphometric variables\nmeasured on the external valve surface. They are described as three new\nspecies in a new genus Psammoneis as P. japonica, P. pseudojaponica and\nP. senegalensis. Molecular phylogenies support placement of the genus\nPsammoneis as a member of the Plagiogrammaceae. However, this placement\nrenders the family morphologically more heterogeneous, especially with\nregards to the areola structure. Therefore, we provide an emended\ndescription of the family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 39","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammoneis gen. nov., 28S rDNA NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3067.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 39","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammoneis gen. nov., 28S rDNA ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3068.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 39","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammoneis gen. nov., 28S rDNA BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3069.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 39","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammoneis gen. nov., 28S rDNA MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 38","ntax":"188","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammoneis gen. nov., 18S rDNA BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3066.phy"}]}
