Objectives of this study were to provide a\nmorphological description of the putative new species, use DNA sequence\ndata of three gene loci (LSU, ITS and rpb2) to accurately place the\nfungus within the Diaporthales, and to prove KochÂ’s postulates.\nMorphological and phylogenetic comparisons confirmed the fungus to\nrepresent a new species and family, for which the names Dwiroopa punicae\nsp. nov. and Dwiroopaceae fam. nov. are proposed. This is the first\nreport of a species of Dwiroopa being pathogenic to Punica\ngranatum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian","ntax":"236","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished Diaporthales LSU ITS RPB2 LSU ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales LSU ITS RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117997.phy"}]}
