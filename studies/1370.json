To determine whether these subgenera are monophyletic and to\ninfer phylogenetic relationships between Rhododendron sections and\nspecies, we carried out a cladistic analysis using molecular data,\nincluding all groups within the genus. For this purpose, we sequenced a\nlarge part of the nuclear gene RPB2-I, encoding a major RNA Polymerase\nII subunit, from 87 species and analyzed the data by maximum parsimony,\nmaximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. The resulting phylogenies show\nsubgenera Azaleastrum and Pentanthera to be polyphyletic and group all\nRhododendron species (except the two in section Therorhodion) into three\nlarge clades. Based upon these results, a modified system of\nRhododendron classification is proposed, consolidating minor subgenera\nthat are related and recognizing monophyletic subgenera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhododendron, MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_480.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhododendron, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2071.phy"}]}
