Group I introns and independent marker genes\nreveal the existence of three sexual but reproductively isolated\nbiospecies in Trichia varia (Myxomycetes).","Journal":" Organisms Diversity and Evolution","Volume":" 15","Issue":" 4","Pages":" 631-650","Keywords":"","DOI":" 10.1007/s13127-015-0230-x","Abstract":" Plasmodial slime molds are members of the class Amoebozoa\nforming elaborate fruit bodies releasing airborne spores. Two species\nconcepts have been developed independently: a morphological relying on\nfruit body characters, and a biological relying on crossing studies of a\nfew cultivable species. In an attempt to reconcile both concepts we\nobtained for 198 specimens of the common species Trichia varia partial\nsequences of three independent markers (nuclear small subunit ribosomal\nRNA gene, extrachromosomal; elongation factor 1 alpha gene, chromosomal;\ncytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial). The resulting\nphylogeny revealed 21 three-marker genotypes clustering into three\ngroups. Combinations of the single-marker genotypes occurred exclusively\nwithin these groups, called 1, 2a, and 2b. To examine the suitability of\ngroup I introns to monitor speciation events, complete SSU sequences\nwere generated for 66 specimens, which revealed six positions that can\ncarry group I introns. For each of the groups 1 and 2a, five of these\npositions were occupied by different intron genotypes; and no genotype\nwas shared by the two groups. Group 2b was devoid of introns. Putatively\nfunctional or degenerated homing endonuclease genes were found at\ndifferent positions in groups 1 and 2a. All observations (genotypic\ncombinations of the three markers, signs of recombination, intron\npatterns) fit well into a pattern of three cryptic biological species\nthat reproduce predominantly sexual but are reproductively isolated. The\npattern of group I introns and inserted homing endonuclease genes mounts\nevidence that the Goddard-Burt intron life cycle model applies to\nnaturally occurring myxomycete populations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Trichia varia Perichaena depressa Trichia scabra\npartial SSU EF1A COI Bayesian","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100041","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100041.phy"},{"tree_label":"bright spored Myxomycete SSU Bayesian","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100038.phy"},{"tree_label":"Trichia varia SSU exon Maximum likelihood","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100039.phy"},{"tree_label":"Amoebozoa HEG Maximum likelihood","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100040.phy"},{"tree_label":"Amoebozoa HEG Bayesian","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100042","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100042.phy"},{"tree_label":"Trichia varia partial SSU EF1A COI Bayesian","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100043.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100044","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100044.phy"},{"tree_label":"bright spored Myxomycete SSU Maximum likelihood","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100045","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100045.phy"},{"tree_label":"Trichia varia SSU exon Bayesian","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100046","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100046.phy"}]}
