One of the largest and most\nabundant species from the Aleutian Islands found at depths ranging\nbetween 125 and 512 m is a new and very unusual gorgonian coral. It has\nstout upright colonies that are laterally branched, with thick, more or\nless clavate terminal branches. Its major distinguishing characteristic\nis its possession of tiny sclerites with stubby double heads, which\noccur in the outermost coenenchyme. Another significant character is its\noval capstans with elaborate ornamentation. The gorgonian is described\nas Alaskagorgia aleutiana new genus and species (Cnidaria: Octocorallia:\nHolaxonia: Plexauridae). It is described and assigned to Plexauridae\nbecause of the affinity of DNA sequences (1337 bp mtDNA: ND2 and MSH1)\nof A. aleutiana with other plexaurid corals, even though the predominant\ncoenenchymal sclerites are somewhat smaller and different than is usual\nin plexaurid genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8A","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plexaurid corals","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1739.phy"}]}
