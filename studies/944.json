Sequences\nfrom these regions of 15 pertusarialean fungi were aligned to those of\nthree representatives of Agyriales used as outgroup. The alignment was\nanalysed cladistically using maximum parsimony. The Pertusariaceae\nappear paraphyletic bearing the monophyletic Coccotremataceae on a clade\nincluding Ochrolechia and Pertusaria subg. Monomuratae, but monophyly of\nthe family cannot be rejected. The genus Pertusaria is polyphyletic,\nwith the subgenus Monomuratae more closely related to the\nCoccotremataceae and Ochrolechia than to taxa of the subgenera\nPertusaria and Pionospora. Monophyly of the genus Pertusaria is\nrejected. The monophyly of the subgenera Pertusaria and Pionospora is\nalso rejected. The distribution of selected characters in the\nPertusariales is investigated and it is shown that apothecial form and\nspore wall number have changed parallel within Pertusaria. The\nPertusaria-type ascus is plesiomorphic within the Pertusariaceae and\nthus cannot be used to circumscribe Pertusaria. The presence of\nchlorinated xanthones is restricted to Pertusaria s. str.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP Tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pertusaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_844.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Tree 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pertusaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_845.phy"}]}
