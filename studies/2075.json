Also included were all but xx genera\nwhose relationships have remained enigmatic despite recent advances in\ndelimiting major lineages of acanths. Results place all of the newly\nsampled taxa with strong support, notably expanding our understanding of\nWhitfieldieae and Barlerieae where most of the newly treated genera are\nplaced. Almost all aspects of the phylogenetic framework of Acanthaceae\nare resolved with extremely strong support, including placement of\nAndrographideae sister to Barlerieae and inclusion of the black\nmangroves Avicennia in the family. However, banch support for the region\nof the phylogeny proximate to Lankesteria and Neuracanthus is weak\n(although both of these genera are strongly supported as monophyletic).\nThis study provides a foundation for future phylogenetic and comparative\nwork, informing lineage choice and sampling strategy while also pointing\nto aspects of relationship that require further phylogenetic study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2-5","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1087.phy"}]}
