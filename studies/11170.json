Morphologically, P. viticola\nis characterized by the production slightly roughened conidia, slightly\nroughened stipes and rapid growth on 25% glycerol nitrate agar (G25N).\nThis species is phylogenetically close to P. angulare S.W. Peterson,\nE.M. Bayer & Wicklow, but differs with respect to colonial\ncharacteristics and conidia and penicilli morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Penicillium viticola, a new species isolated from a\ngrape in Japan","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27349.phy"}]}
