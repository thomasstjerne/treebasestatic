This study aims\nto identify and characterise species of Diaporthe associated with\nsymptomatic peach trees showing exudates in Jinshui Experimental Orchard\nof Hubei Academy of Agriculture Sciences in Hubei, China with\ndescriptions of three new species: D. momicola sp. nov., D. pescicola\nsp. nov. and D. taoicola sp. nov. Fungal identification was accomplished\nusing a combination of morphological and pathogenic characteristics\ntogether with phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS), partial translation elongation factor 1-α sequence (EF1-α),\nβ-tubulin (BT) and calmodulin (CAL). Diaporthe eres was the most\ncommonly isolated (70% of all isolates). All identified species were\nable to cause necrotic lesions at different levels of severity when\ninoculated in detached peach shoots.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe species associated with peach disease","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_98797.phy"}]}
