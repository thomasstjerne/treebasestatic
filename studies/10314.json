Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses including representatives of all American genera\nof Atripliceae and data from 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal (ITS, ETS) and\nchloroplast (3Â’trnK intron) DNA sequences suggest that neither Atriplex,\nas traditionally recognized, nor the North American members of Atriplex\nconstitute a monophyletic group. Congruence between well-supported\nnuclear and chloroplast clades and results of expanded leaf anatomical\nand isotopic analyses indicate that American taxa belong to two\ndistantly related lineages with different photosynthetic pathways; only\none shift from C3 to C4 photosynthesis is required to explain\nphotosynthetic-pathway evolution in sampled lineages of Atripliceae.\nConservatism in photosynthetic-pathway evolution in the tribe is\nexemplified by the endemic, C3 North American Atriplex taxa, which are\nnested among other genera (e.g., Grayia, Holmbergia, Zuckia) within a\nrobust C3 clade. One North American C3 genus, Suckleya, often included\nwithin Atripliceae should be excluded from the tribe. A previous\nhypothesis of variation in photosynthetic pathway within Atriplex\nphyllostegia sensu H. M. Hall and Clem. is rejected. A revised taxonomy\nemploying only monophyletic groups reflects this new understanding of\ngeneric- and species-level relationships within the tribe. Extriplex\nincludes E. californica (comb. nov.) and E. joaquinana (comb. nov.) and\nhas not been recognized as a natural group by previous authors. Stutzia\nis proposed to replace the name Endolepis Torr. (1860), a later homonym\nof Endolepis Schleid. (1846), and includes S. covillei (comb. nov.) and\nS. dioica (comb. nov.). Grayia (G. plummeri, comb. nov., and G.\narizonica, comb. nov.) is expanded to include Zuckia. Recognition of\nProatriplex as distinct from Atriplex is supported. Holmbergia is\nretained in Atripliceae. The improved phylogenetic understanding of\nAtripliceae should allow for more meaningful comparative studies of\nphysiological and other functional adaptations of Atriplex, especially\nin North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6959","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6959.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP ITSETS 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6964","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6964.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6963.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6961","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6961.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 7","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6972","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6972.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 6","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6971","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6971.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 8","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6973","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6973.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6962.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 5","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6970","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6970.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6969","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6969.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6968.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6967.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP cp 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6966.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP ITSETS 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6965.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr6960","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_6960.phy"}]}
