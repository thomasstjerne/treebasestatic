Therefore, fragments of the 28S rRNA gene have been\nsequenced to elucidate some crucial points in the evolution of spiders.\nThe following results were obtained. (1) The 28S rRNA gene data support\nthe monophyly of the Entelegynae. Thus, the number of different subunits\nand the number of hexamers which form a haemocyanin complex must have\nbeen reduced at least twice within the spiders. The character state\npattern within the spiders and within the Arachnida suggests that these\nreductions are due to a decrease in the selection on the oxygen binding\nproperties of the haemocyanins as a result of the evolution of tracheae.\n(2) The semientelegyne spiders are not a transition stage between the\nHaplogynae and the Entelegynae. The lack of separate fertilization ducts\nin these species is probably due to secondary reduction. This reduction\nhas decisive consequences for the flow of the sperm and for sperm\ncompetition. (3) Furthermore, the 28S rRNA gene data tentatively support\nthe hypothesis that the orb web is either a plesiomorphy or has evolved\nat least twice.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Araneomorph spiders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1120.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Araneomorph spiders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1118.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Araneomorph spiders","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1119.phy"}]}
