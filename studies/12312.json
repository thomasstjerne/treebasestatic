Transcription factors (TFs) and transcription regulators (TRs)\nregulate spatial and temporal gene expression. A plethora of\ntranscriptional regulatory proteins have been identified and classified\ninto families on the basis of sequence similarity. The purpose of this\nwork is to identify the TF and TR complement in diverse species\nbelonging to Stramenopiles in order to understand how these regulators\nmay contribute to the observed diversity. Results We identified and\nclassified 63 TF and TR families in 11 species of Stramenopiles. In some\nspecies we found families with high relative importance, however, other\nspecies show homogenity across families. Taking into account the 63 TF\nand TR families identified, 28 TF and TR families were established to be\npositively correlated with specific traits like number of predicted\nproteins, number of flagella and number of cell types during the life\ncycle. Additionally, we found gains and several losses in TF and TR\nfamilies specific to some species and clades, as well as, two family\nwith high abundance specific to the autotrophic species and three family\nwith high abundance specific to the heterotropic species. Conclusions\nFor the first time, there is a systematic search of TF and TR families\nin Stramenopiles. The attempts to uncover relationships between these\nfamilies and the complexity of this group may be of great impact,\nconsidering that there are several important pathogens of plants and\nanimals, as well as, important species involved in carbon cycle.\nSpeficific TF and TR families identified in this work appear to be\ncorrelated with particular traits in the Stramenopiles group, as well\nas, gains, losses and high abundance found in some TF and TR families\nmay be correlated with the high complexity and diversity of the\nStramenopiles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"str_Aln_2_0_full","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50599","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_1_0_full","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50601","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50601.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_1_5_less1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_2_0_full","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50593","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50593.phy"},{"tree_label":"str_Aln_1_5_full","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50597","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50597.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_1_0_less","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50602","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50602.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_1_5_full","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50591.phy"},{"tree_label":"str_Aln_2_0_less1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50600","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50600.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_2_0_full","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50605","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50605.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_1_0_full","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50589.phy"},{"tree_label":"str_Aln_1_5_less1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50598","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50598.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_2_0_less1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50606","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50606.phy"},{"tree_label":"str_Aln_1_0_less1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50596","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_1_0_less1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stramenopiles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50590.phy"},{"tree_label":"str_Aln_1_0_full","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50595","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_1_5_less1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50604","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50604.phy"},{"tree_label":"Str_Alv_Aln_1_5_full","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50603","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50603.phy"},{"tree_label":"Aln_2_0_less1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50594","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50594.phy"}]}
