Recent studies have indicated that it included cryptic\nspecies, some of which are identified in this study. Isolates from\nvarious geographical origins were collected and compared based on\nmorphology, DNA sequence data of the β-tubulin, histone H3 and\ntranslation elongation factor-1α regions and mating compatibility.\nComparisons of the DNA sequence data and mating compatibility revealed\nthree new species. These included Ca. colombiana sp. nov. from Colombia,\nCa. polizzii sp. nov. from Italy and Ca. zuluensis sp. nov. from South\nAfrica, all of which had distinguishing morphological features. Based on\nDNA sequence data, Ca. brasiliensis is also elevated to species\nlevel.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria pauciramosa Combined Data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_8919.phy"}]}
