Seven species and two\nvarieties are recognized. Three species are endemic to Ecuador and two\nto Peru; two additional, largely Ecuadorean, species are occasional in\nPeru. Eucrosia is primarily a xeric, lowland, floristic element,\ninhabiting seasonally dry vegetation of the lower, western slopes and\nPacific coastal lowlands, with a single species adapted to montane\nrainforest understory. The genus is marked by its petiolate leaves with\nwide laminae; weakly to strongly zygomorphic flowers; long, declinate\nstamens in all but one species; and the presence of androecial nectar\nglands in five of the species. Pollen exine morphology exhibits a\nphylogenetically significant transformation series from\nsemi-tectate/reticulate to verrucate/fossulate. The most common somatic\nchromosome number is 2n = 46. The flowers are putatively adapted for\nbutterfly pollination, but a single report of hummingbird visitation is\nrecorded for E. eucrosioides. Phylogenetic analysis places E.\nstricklandii as the most primitive species in the genus. Phaedranassa\nand Rauhia are the genera closest to Eucrosia, and it is hypothesized\nthat Stenomesson is ancestral to these three.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 50","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amaryllidaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1517.phy"}]}
