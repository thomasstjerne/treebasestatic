Acrodictys-like\nspecies are characterized by darkly pigmented and muriform conidia\nproduced from holoblastic conidiogenous cells on macronematous,\nmononematous, cylindrical and unbranched or infrequently branched\nconidiophores. Phylogenetic analyses of LSU, SSU, ITS and β-tubulin\nsequence data leads us to propose two novel families, Acrodictaceae\n(Sordariomycetes) and Junewangiaceae (Sordariomycetes). In addition, a\nnew genus, a new species and a new combinations are introduced. Two\nnames, Acrodictys globulosa and Acrodictys malabarica, are\nresurrected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes LSU, SSU, ITS and tub2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111615.phy"}]}
