Although\nPiperales is clearly monophyletic, the precise relationship within the\norder is ambiguous due to inconsistent placements of Lactoris\nfernandeziana. The appearance in some studies of Lactoris within\nAristolochiaceae and the incongruence in generic treatments have also\nraised questions about the infrastructure of the family. This study\naddresses the overall generic relationships in the Aristolochiaceae and\nits position in the Piperales based on dense taxon sampling and sequence\ndata from the plastid trnL-F region. The study resolved Piperales\nconsisting of two major clades (Piperaceae plus Saururaceae and\nLactoridaceae plus Aristolochiaceae) and Lactoris nested within\nAristolochiaceae but with low support. The concept of two subfamilies in\nAristolochiaceae, Asaroideae and Aristolochioideae, gains maximum\nstatistical support. A generic treatment of Aristolochiaceae based on\ntrnL-F is proposed which is congruent with recent analyses based on\nmorphological characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aristolochiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_650.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aristolochiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2261.phy"}]}
