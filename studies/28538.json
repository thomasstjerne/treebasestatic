Elongation factor 1-alpha gene sequence data, classically used\nfor Fusarium spp. identification, suggested that some isolates\ncorresponded to so far undescribed Nectriaceae species. In this context,\na multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, based on ten loci, namely the large\nsubunit of the ATP citrate lyase (acl1), alpha-actin (act), calmodulin\n(cmdA), histone H3 (his3), the internal transcribed spacer region and\nintervening 5.8S nrRNA (ITS), 28S large subunit (LSU), RNA polymerase II\nlargest subunit (rpb1), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2),\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and β-tubulin (tub2), was\ntherefore performed to determine the phylogenetic position of ten cheese\nand one environmental isolates. Phylogenetic reconstructions were then\ndone using a Nectriaceae sequence dataset. Additionally, morphological\nobservations as well as metabolite profiling were performed. Results\nclearly revealed the existence of four cheese-associated novel species,\nnamely Bisifusarium allantoides, Bisifusarium penicilloides,\nLonginectria lagenoides, Longinectria verticilliforme, the two latter\nbelonging to a novel genus (Longinectria gen. nov.).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure S1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bisifusarium ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_132099.phy"}]}
