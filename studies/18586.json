Among Fusarium species, Fusarium ramigenum, belonging to\nfujikuroi complex, was never identified as a human pathogen. Here we\ndescribe the first case of invasive fusariosis caused by Fusarium\nramigenum in human and also describe the immunological deficiencies most\nlikely contributing to the invasiveness. Case presentation: A\n32-year-old Caucasian male with an apparent insignificant medical\nhistory of mild respiratory illnesses during the previous two years,\ndeveloped invasive pulmonary fusariosis. Detailed immunological\nassessment revealed the presence of common variable immunodeficiency,\ncomplicated by a severe impairment of the capacity of T-cells to produce\nboth gamma-interferon and interleukin-17. In-depth microbiological\nassessment identified the novel human opportunistic pathogen Fusarium\nramigenum as cause of the infection. Conclusion: This report\ndemonstrated that an opportunistic invasive fungal infection usually\nindicates an underlying cellular immune impairment of the host. The\nunexpected invasive infection with Fusarium ramigenum in this case\nunmasked complex combined humoral and cellular immunological\ndeficiencies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium ramigenum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96143.phy"}]}
