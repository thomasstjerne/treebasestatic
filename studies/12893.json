Danio is restricted to species previously recognized as\nthe “Danio dangila species group,” including D. dangila, Danio rerio,\nDanio nigrofasciatus, and Danio albolineatus. Those species share an “A\nstripe” on the anal-fin rays, an anterior lateral extension ventrally on\nthe dentary, two or more pigment stripes on the caudal-fin rays and\ngreatly enlarged lamellar nasal. Esomus is the sister group of Danio.\nRemaining Danio (sensu lato) species are referred to Deuario,\ncharacterized by a short and wide premaxillary ascending process with a\nminute apophysis contacting the kinethmoid, a short max-Uary barbel, a\n“P stripe” extending onto the median caudal-fin rays, and infraorbital 5\nnot or only slightly reduced. Dmario includes the species Dmario\nmalabaricus, Deuario Kakhienensis, Dmario deuario, Deuario\nchrysotaeniatus, Deuario maetaengensis, Dmario interruptus, and Deuario\napogon. The sister group of Dmario is a clade composed of Znlecypis and\nChela. The well-known genus Brachydanio becomes a junior synonym of\nDanio (sensu stricto). The phylogenetic relationships of small Danielike\nspecies Sundadanio axelrodi, Danionella translucida, Danio\nerythromicron, and Microrasbota rubescens remain unresolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asian Cyprinid genus Danio","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53780.phy"}]}
