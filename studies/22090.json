The hyaline\nappearance of the valve and the high striation density, which is\nindiscernible under a light microscope, makes the identification of most\nspecies difficult, and very few studies have investigated their\nmorphology, phylogeny or ecology in detail. In an extensive study of\ndiatom communities from the hypersaline Mar Menor coastal lagoon (SE\nSpain), several new taxa were found. Herein we propose Hyalosynedra\nlanceolata sp. nov. based on morphological observations (light and\nelectron microscopy) and molecular data (phylogenetic and sequence\ndivergence analyses). The species has distinctive morphological\ncharacters (radiate colony, biseriate striation, lanceolate sternum and\ntwo long laminar lobed chloroplasts) that are new for the genus and have\nbeen included in a proposal to extend the genus description. Our results\nalso show that H. toxoneides does not belong to Hyalosynedra, but\nappears to be more closely related to Thalassionema and Thalassiothrix.\nHowever, further molecular and morphological research is needed to\nclarify its taxonomic position.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109437","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109437.phy"}]}
