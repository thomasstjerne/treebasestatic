Analyses of a\ncombined ITS, TEF1 and BTUB sequence data matrix was applied to infer\nthe phylogenetic position of these new isolates in Pestalotiopsis. The\nphylogenetic results indicate that two of these new isolates are\nmonophyletic and constitute a distinct lineage that perceived a\ntaxonomic novelty in Pestalotiopsis. This clade sharing a close\nphylogenetic affinity to P. adusta, P. krabiensis, P. Pandanicola and P.\npapuana. The comparison of morphological features with the\nphylogenetically closely related taxa are given and these two isolates\nwere introduced as Pestalotiopsis dracaenicola sp. nov. with\ncomprehensive descriptions and illustrations herein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125342","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125342.phy"}]}
