Fungal nucleotide sequence data from the internal\ntranscribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) region were\nobtained from fruitbodies, ectomycorrhiza and pure cultures. Maximum\nparsimony (MP), distance (neighbor joining, NJ) and maximum likelihood\n(ML) analyses of aligned ITS sequences highlighted three clades\ndesignated T. echinospora, T. submollis and T. bresadoliana. Sporocarp\ntissue and ectomycorrhizas, or isolated mycelia, previously described as\nPinirhiza rosea, Piceirhiza rosea or Pink were clearly identified in a\nstrongly supported T. submollis clade. Host-linked population variation\nin this clade was also noted that may reflect active speciation\nactivity. A fungus isolated from Beige-type mycorrhizas formed on Scots\npine seedlings appeared in the paraphyletic T. echinospora clade which\nincluded sequences showing greater divergence. The data provide a\nprimary classification of Tomentellopsis species that is urgently needed\nin assessment of the importance of resupinate thelephoroid fungi in\nmycorrhizal communities associated with trees in coniferous and\ndeciduous forest ecosystems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1186.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1187.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1188.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1189.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1191.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tomentellopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1192.phy"}]}
