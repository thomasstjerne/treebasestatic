S. A., is described and illustrated.\nThe phylogenetic position of the new species was assessed by parsimony\nand maximum likelihood analyses of nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK-trnK,\ntrnL-trnF) DNA sequences of 61 species/35 genera of Spiranthinae and 15\nadditional species and genera of Cranichideae. The results indicate a\nclose relationship of the new species to several species previously\nincluded in Schiedeella, especially S. wercklei, but our analyses also\nshow that such a group does not belong to the clade that includes the\ntype species of Schiedeella (S. transversalis), being instead sister to\nMesadenus. A new genus, Greenwoodiella, is proposed to include the new\nspecies (G. deserticola) and its closest relatives (G. micrantha var.\nmicrantha, G. micrantha var. garayana, and G. wercklei). The identity of\nLexarzaÂ’s Neottia micrantha is clarified, the other species belonging in\nthis clade are discussed, and the required transfers made. An\nidentification key to the three species and two varieties we recognize\nin the new genus is provided","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Greenwoodiella matK trnK trnL IGS ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97405.phy"}]}
