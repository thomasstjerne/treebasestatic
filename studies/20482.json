However, the LGM is just the most\nrecent of the 20+ glacial-interglacial periods that characterize the\nQuaternary. Here we investigate the role of climatic changes on the\nevolution and population dynamics of the South American cactus Cereus\nhildmannianus, and geomorphological features in shaping the population\ndistribution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105277.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"467","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101735","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101735.phy"}]}
