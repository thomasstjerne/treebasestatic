Phylogeny based on\nmultiple loci DNA sequences including the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) regions, the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the\nsmall subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nSSU), the small subunit\nmitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the translation elongation factor 1-Î±\ngene (tef1), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb1) and the\nsecond subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) recognized ten distantly\nrelated clades of Postia sensu lato (s. l.). Four new genera,\nAmaropostia, Calcipostia, Cystidiopostia, Fuscopostia are established,\nnine new species, Amaropostia hainanensis, Cyanosporus fusiformis, C.\nmicropora, C. mongolicus , C. piceicola, C. subhirsuta, C. tricolor, C.\nungulata, Postia sublowei are identified. Illustrated descriptions of\nthe new species and genera are described. Identification keys to Postia\nand its related genera, as well as keys to the species of each genus are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Postia Small","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101547.phy"},{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Postia Large","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101546.phy"}]}
