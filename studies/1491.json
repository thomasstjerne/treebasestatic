This new species is distinguished from other named members of\nthis endemic genus by a variety of mensural and discrete morphological\ncharacters. Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial ND2 gene supports\nits recognition as a distinct species and suggests a sister relationship\nwith the much more widespread M. cowani. Microgale jobihely appears to\nbe the only member of this genus to be a very localized endemic and a\nbiogeographic scenario is presented to explain this observation. It is\ncurrently known from a small area of forest, outside of the protected\nareas system, that is faced with considerable anthropogenic\npressure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shrew tenrecs Microgale","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_912.phy"}]}
