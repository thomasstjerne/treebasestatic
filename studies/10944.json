Among the 25 species several are new, and here we describe four\nfrom tropical Australia. The new species C. costatus, C. queenslandicus,\nC. umbellatus, and C. variabilis are illustrated, their distributions\nare mapped based on 7Â–50 collections per species, and information is\nprovided on habitats and conservation status. We also validate C.\nalthaeoides comb. nov. and C. argenteus comb. nov., update the\ndescription of C. picrocarpus, and provide a key to the 11 native and\nnaturalized species of Cucumis occurring in Australia and eastern\nMalesia. The Australasian species diversity of Cucumis, a genus that\nuntil recently was held to be essentially African, is of interest also\nbecause Australia harbours the sister species to the commercially\nimportant melon, C. melo.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucumis trnLF; trnS G; matK; rpl20 rps12; rbcL;\nITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25501.phy"}]}
