The new genus\nTrichiochlaena is proposed on the basis of shared morphological\ncharacters, such as plants with membranous ligules, inflorescences lax\nand open, spikelets ellipsoid to obovoid, pilose or glabrous, lower\nglume ½ to 1/1 the spikelet length, and upper anthecium indurate with\nbicellular microhairs and simple papillae all over its surface. These\nmorphological characteristics were confirmed with molecular phylogenetic\nstudies, analyzing chloroplast ndhF and rpoA sequences. As a result, a\ntotal of 38 American and African species are considered within the genus\nTrichiochlaena, and therefore a total of 38 new combinations are\nproposed. The new genus is compared with other genera of the Paniceae.\nLectotypes are designated for Isachne trochainii A.
