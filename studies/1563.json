Several isolates were baited\nfrom soils collected in various parts of the world, while others were\nassociated with leaf litter or symptomatic plant hosts. Isolates were\ncompared based on morphology, as well as DNA sequence data from their\nb-tubulin and histone gene H3 regions. Two species, Cy. australiense and\nCy. ecuadoriae, are newly described based on morphology and molecular\ndata. The Cylindrocladium species associated with toppling disease of\nbanana is identified as Cy. flexuosum. An epitype is designated for Cy.\nilicicola, and a new name, Curvicladiella, proposed for the mitosporic\ngenus Curvicladium, as the latter name is already occupied.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria spp., 1 of 657 MPTs from beta-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2486.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria spp., 1 of 4 MPTs from H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2487.phy"}]}
