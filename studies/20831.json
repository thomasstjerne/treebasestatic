In this study, one new Epichloë endophytes, Epichloë sinensis\nisolated from Festuca sinensis was collected from northwest of China.\nThe morphological results indicated that this endophyte had typical\nmorphological characteristics in Epichloë genus. Phylogenetic\nrelationships based on introns sequences of the housekeeping genes\nβ-tubulin (tubB) showed that this endophyte was asexual interspecific\nhybrid from E. typhina complex (ETC) and E.sibirica in subclade I-tub.\nMorphology and phylogenetic evidence supported the designation of\nisolates from F. sinensis as a new interspecific hybrid species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103234","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103234.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103235","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103235.phy"}]}
