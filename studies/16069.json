Several Colletotrichum isolates,\npreviously reported as closely related to C. destructivum, are known to\nestablish hemibiotrophic infections in different hosts. The inconsistent\napplication of names to those isolates based on outdated species\nconcepts has caused much taxonomic confusion, particularly in the plant\npathology literature. A multilocus DNA sequence analysis (ITS, GAPDH,\nCHS-1, HIS3, ACT, TUB2) of 83 isolates of C. destructivum and related\nspecies revealed 16 clades that are recognised as separate species in\nthe C. destructivum complex, which includes C. destructivum, C. fuscum,\nC. higginsianum, C. lini and C. tabacum. Each of these species is\nlecto-, epi- or neotypified in this study. Additionally, eight species,\nnamely C. americae-borealis, C. antirrhinicola, C. bryoniicola, C.\nlentis, C. ocimi, C. pisicola, C. utrechtense and C. vignae are newly\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum destructivum species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76585.phy"}]}
