{"Authors":" Nan Song","Year":" 2015","Title":" An assessment of the utility of mitogenome data on the\ndeep-level phylogeny of Holometabola","Journal":" Journal of Systematics and Evolution","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" data treatment, mitochondrial genome, Holometabola,\nphylogeny","DOI":"","Abstract":" Mitochondrial genome is one of the most widely used marker\nfor phylogenetic analysis. Compared to larger genome data, mitochondrial\ngenome is less expensive and more conveniently obtained. However, some\nfeatures like compositional bias and accelerated evolutionary rate\nreduce the effectiveness of mitochondrial genome to insect phylogeny. In\nthis paper, we implemented different data manipulating strategies and\ndistinct substitution models to the phylogenetic inference of\nHolometabola. The result showed that the Degen-coding scheme and the\nsite-heterogeneous CAT model could better correct for some systematic\nerrors and reconstruct a reasonable phylogeny of Holometabola. The\nmonophyly of major supraordinal clades and a monophyletic Holometabola\nwere supported. This paper illustrates the relative strengths and\nshortcomings of the mitochondrial genome data for assessing the\nchallenging problem of higher-level insect phylogenetics, and thereby\nprovides useful pointers for future utilities of this type of data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"pb_185taxa_allgenes","ntax":"184","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90921.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML_185taxa_allgenes","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90920.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB185taxa_pcg_13ry","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90934","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90934.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml_185taxa_pcg123","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90935.phy"},{"tree_label":"185TAXA_PCG123-PB","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90936","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90936.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90918.phy"},{"tree_label":"176taxaRAxML","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90919.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML_185taxa_pcg12","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90924.phy"},{"tree_label":"phylobayes_185taxa_pcg12","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90925","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90925.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml_185taxa_aminoacids","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90928.phy"},{"tree_label":"pb_185taxa_AA185taxa_AA","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90929.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml_185taxa_pcg_1ry+2nd","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90930","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90930.phy"},{"tree_label":"phylobayes_185taxa_pcg_1ry+2nd","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90931","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90931.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml_185taxa_pcg_13ry","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90933","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90933.phy"},{"tree_label":"185taxa ML tRNA","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Holometabola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90891.phy"},{"tree_label":"185taxa PB tRNA","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90892.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml 185taxa pcg degen","ntax":"184","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"raxml 185taxa pcg degen","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90964.phy"},{"tree_label":"phylobayes 185taxa pcg degen","ntax":"183","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90965.phy"},{"tree_label":"raxml_185taxa_pcg_3ry","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90966.phy"},{"tree_label":"phylobayes_185taxa_pcg_3ry","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr90967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90967.phy"},{"tree_label":"PB_149taxa_rrnas.tre","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr91015","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91015.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML 149taxa rrnas.tre","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91014","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91014.phy"}]}
