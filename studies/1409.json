The data are analysed both\nseparately and combined, with parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nanalyses. In total, 19 terminal taxa are examined, including 12\nelytrabearing taxa from all scale-worm groups, Palmyra, Pisione and five\noutgroup taxa. The results show that Palmyra and Pisione are nested\nwithin Aphroditiformia. Palmyra is sister to Aphrodita, and both Pisione\nand Pholoe are positioned within Sigalionidae, suggesting that both\nfamily names Pisionidae and Pholoidae should be treated as junior\nsynonyms of Sigalionidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphroditiformia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2240.phy"}]}
