Our phylogenetic analyses on the basis of an increased number\nof molecular genetic loci from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes\nunambiguously demonstrate that ‘Cepaea’ vindobonensis represents the\nsister group of the Caucasotachea taxa, with C. leucoranea from the\nCaspian region of Azerbaijan and Iran being the sister species of the\nremaining Caucasian and eastern Pontic Caucasotachea species. We argue\nfor the inclusion of ‘Cepaea’ vindobonensis in Caucasotachea rather than\nfor a re-erection of a monotypic genus Austrotachea for the species\nbecause of the overall low degree of morphological differentiation and\nthe low number of species in the group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1+","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caucasotachea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97683.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caucasotachea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91298.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caucasotachea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91340.phy"}]}
