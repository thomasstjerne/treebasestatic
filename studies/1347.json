Warwick, Connie A Sauder","Year":" 2005","Title":" Phylogeny of tribe Brassiceae (Brassicaceae) based on\nchloroplast restriction site polymorphisms and nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and chloroplast trnL intron\nsequences","Journal":" Canadian Journal of Botany","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Using sequence data from the ITS region (internal\ntranscribed spacers ITS-1 and ITS-2 of nuclear DNA and the 5.8 rRNA\ngene), chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence data from the trnL intron and\ncpDNA restriction site polymorphism data, we examined the evolutionary\nrelationships of the tribe Brassiceae (Brassicaceae). A group of\napproximately 50 genera, it is distinguished by the presence of\nconduplicate cotyledons and/or heteroarthrocarpic fruit. cpDNA\nrestriction site data and ITS, trnL, and combined ITS/trnL sequence data\nwere obtained for 22, 104, 94, and 87 taxa in the tribe, respectively.\nResults from maximum parsimony analyses of the cpDNA and ITS and\nITS/trnL sequence data showed a monophyletic origin for the tribe, with\nthe inclusion of controversial members Calepina, Conringia and\nOrychophragmus. ITS- and ITS/trnL-based clades corresponded to taxonomic\nsubtribes: Vellinae, Zillinae, and Savignyinae; but as with previous\ncpDNA studies, there was little support for subtribes Brassicinae,\nRaphaninae and Moricandiinae. Although there was no support for the\nRapa/Oleracea or Nigra cpDNA lineages, many cpDNA subclades within each\nof them were evident in the ITS- and ITS/trnL-based phylogeny. The trnL\nsequence data provided little or no resolution of tribal or subtribal\nlimits. The ITS-based data indicated polyphyletic origins for Brassica,\nDiplotaxis and Erucastrum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassiceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4473.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassiceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4476.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassiceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4474.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassiceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4475.phy"}]}
