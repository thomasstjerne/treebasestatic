In this paper, a new genus,\nSublophiostoma is introduced to accommodate the taxon, S. thailandica\nsp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses using combined ITS, LSU, RPB2, SSU, and\nTEF1 sequences demonstrate that six strains of the new species form a\ndistinct clade within Pleosporales, but cannot be assigned to any\nexsisting family. Therefore, a new family Sublophiostomataceae\n(Pleosporales) is introduced to accommodate the new genus. The sexual\nmorph of Sublophiostomataceae is characterized by subglobose to\nhemisphaerical, ostiolate ascomata, with crest-like openings, a peridium\nwith cells of textura angularis to textura epidermoidea,\ncylindric-clavate asci with a bulbous or foot-like narrow pedicel and a\nwell-developed ocular chamber, and 1-septate ascospores surrounded by a\nlarge mucilaginous sheath. The coelomycetous character of the asexual\nmorph is observed on culture media.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"235","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126748","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126748.phy"}]}
