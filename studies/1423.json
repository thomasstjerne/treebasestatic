Laccaria is an\nimportant group of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes widely used in\nexperimental and applied research. A systematic study of alpine Laccaria\nspecies using morphological, cultural and molecular (ribosomal DNA\ninternal transcribed spacer) data revealed five taxa in the Rocky\nMountain alpine zone: L. laccata var. pallidifolia, L. nobilis (the\nfirst published report for arctic-alpine habitats), L. pumila, L.\nmontana and L. pseudomontana (a newly described taxon similar to L.\nmontana, with more ellipsoidal, finely echinulate basidiospores). All\noccur in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado; however, only L.\npumila and L. montana were found on the Beartooth Plateau in the\nNorthern Rocky Mountains of Montana and Wyoming. All are associated with\ndwarf and shrub Salix species, with L. laccata var. pallidifolia also\nassociated with Dryas octopetala and Betula glandulosa.\nMaximum-parsimony phylogenetic analysis of rDNA-ITS sequences for 27\nLaccaria accessions supports the morphological species\ndelineations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laccaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_318.phy"}]}
