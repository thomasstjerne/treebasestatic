All\nspecies have bi-celled ascospores with a prominent sheath. A second type\nof appendage is present in the former two species, a single tuft of\nfibrillar appendages is present in N. effusa and two occur in N.\nbipolaris. Nimbospora effusa and N. bipolaris are morphologically\nsimilar, but there are major morphological differences in ascomatal\nmorphology between N. effusa/N. bipolaris and N. octonae. In this study,\nmorphology of N. effusa and N. octonae and phylogeny of the three\nNimbospora species based on the partial 18S and 28S rRNA genes were\ninvestigated. Bayesian analysis suggested that Nimbospora is not\nmonophyletic. Nimbospora effusa groups with N. bipolaris in a\nwell-supported clade with Naufragella spinibarbata forming a sister\ngroup. Nimbospora octonae, however, clusters with Haligena elaterophora\nin a separate, well-supported clade. The ascoma of N. octonae differs\nfrom that of N. effusa and N. bipolaris by its thick peridium,\nascospores lacking equatorial tufts of appendages but having polar and\nequatorial subulate appendages after the sheath is dissolved. Based on\nthese characters and the correlating phylogenetic distance, a new genus,\nEbullia, is established to accommodate N. octonae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nimbospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68071.phy"}]}
