Both taxa share brown outer peridium and\n1-septate brown ascospores in uniserriate asci. Amphisphaeria flava is\ncharacterized by ostiole surrounding pale yellow host surface and\ncomparatively thin peridium and ascopores. Amphisphaeria thailandica is\ncharacterized by ellipsoid to oval ascospores. Maximum parsimony,\nMaximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses of a combined ITS and\nLSU DNA sequence data show that A. flava and A. thailandica are distinct\nfrom other Amphispheria species in family Amphisphaeriaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114129.phy"}]}
