Although the genus is distributed\nover northern temperate regions, we know little about the phylogeny and\ndiversity of Tuber species in Japan. We have collected 186 new Tuber\nascoma samples in Japan over a 10 y period. The identities and\nphylogenies of the samples were analyzed with sequences of four nuclear\nloci (i.e.Â internal tran- scribed spacer [ITS] and large subunit [LSU]\nregions of rDNA, elongation factor 1 alpha [EF1-a], and RNA polymerase\nII large subunit [rpb2] genes). Based on the species delimitation of 95%\nsequence matches in the ITS region, which is a suitable region for\nspecies- level identification of higher fungi, we identified 20 Tuber\nspecies. The number of observed species did not reach an asymptote with\nour maximum sampling localities in a species accumulation curve. The\nChao2 species richness estimator indicated that at least 40 Tuber\nspecies should be present in Japan. Molecular phylogenetic analyses\nrevealed that Japanese Tuber species belong to five major phylogroups,\nincluding Macrosporum, which had not been reported previous- ly in Asia.\nTwo Japanese species were morphologically and phylogenetically distinct\nfrom other known phylogroups, and here we propose a new Tuber\nphylogroup, Japonicum. In addition most of the other Japanese species\nformed separate clades within individual major phylogroups and deserve\nto be proposed as new species. Detailed molecular phylogeny within\nindividual phylogroups revealed the existence of phylogeographic\nstructures at both continental and within-Asia scales, indicating that\nmigration and allopatric speciation have occurred even between the\nmainland and islands in Asia. Although our findings substantially\nadvance current understanding of Tuber diversity and phylogeny,\ncomparable richness estimation and multilocus phy- logeny in other\ngeographic regions are necessary to unequivocally address global\npatterns of Tuber diver- sity and biogeography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Macrosporum NJ","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrosporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25409.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rufum NJ","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25413.phy"},{"tree_label":"Melanosporum NJ","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25414.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU ML","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25415.phy"},{"tree_label":"Puberulum ML","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25416.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML2","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles (Tuber spp.)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50411.phy"},{"tree_label":"4loci Bayes2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles (Tuber spp.)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50409.phy"},{"tree_label":"Brumale","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brumale","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25342.phy"},{"tree_label":"Macrosporum ML","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrosporum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25408.phy"},{"tree_label":"4loci ML2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles (Tuber spp.)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Japonicum","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japonicum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25343.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rufum ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25412.phy"},{"tree_label":"Puberulum NJ","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25417.phy"},{"tree_label":"4loci Bayes2_1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Japanese truffles (Tuber spp.)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50410.phy"}]}
