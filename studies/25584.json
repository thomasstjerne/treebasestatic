Multiclavula petricola is described as\na new species based on morphological characters, its unique habitat, and\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA sequence. The fruiting\nbodies of M. petricola were dispersed on wet rock surface with a lot of\ntiny globular lichenized thalli. The phylogenetic analyses indicated\nthat its affiliation is in the genus Multiclavula, however, the\nrelationship with other Multiclavula species was not resolved. The\nbasidiospores of M. petricola germinated on water agar plate, and the\ngrowth on PDA was slow. The brief descriptions of cultural aspects were\nalso provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121403","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121403.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121404","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121404.phy"}]}
