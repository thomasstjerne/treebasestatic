Herein, we sequenced the complete\nplastome genome of P. ovata by using Illumina HiSeq-2000 platform and\nperformed comparative analysis with previously published genome from\nfamily Plantaginaceae. The results revealed that P. ovata plastome is\n162,116 bp with a typical quadripartite structure, containing a large\nsingle copy region of 82,084 bp and small single copy region of 5,272\nbp. The genome contained markedly higher inverted repeats size up to\n37.4 kb suggesting large scale inversion of 13.8 kb within the expanded\ninverted repeat regions. The plastome of P. ovata contain 149 different\ngenes, including 43 tRNA, 8 rRNA and 98 proteins coding. The analysis\nrevealed 139 microsatellites, where 71 were found in non-coding regions.\nSimilarly, about 32 forward, 34 tandem and 17 palindromic repeats were\nalso detected. The complete genome sequences, 72 shared genes, matK and\nrbcL genes from related species suggested that P. ovata formed single\nclade with P. maritima and P. media in phylogenetic analysis. The result\nconcludes that P. ovata has significant variation in inverted repeat\nregion, which suggest the stability of plastome genome of P. ovata as\ncompared to other species of Plantaginaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plantago ovata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117899.phy"}]}
