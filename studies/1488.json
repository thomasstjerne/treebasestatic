Most of the 600 species (in seven families and\n13 genera) are arborescent, but considerable morphological variability\nexists, spanning the giant scaly tree ferns (Cyatheaceae), the low,\nerect plants (Plagiogyriaceae), and the diminutive creeping endemics of\nthe Guyana Highlands in Venezuela (Hymenophyllopsidaceae). In this study\nwe investigate phylogenetic relationships within tree ferns based on\nanalyses of four protein-coding, plastid loci (atpA, atpB, rbcL, and\nrps4). Our results reveal four well-supported clades, with genera of\nDicksoniaceae (sensu Kubitzki, 1990) interspersed among them: A)\n(Loxomataceae, (Culcita, Plagiogyriaceae)), B) (Calochlaena, (Dicksonia,\nLophosoriaceae)), C) Cibotium, and D) Cyatheaceae, with\nHymenophyllopsidaceae nested within. How these four groups are related\nto one other, to Thyrsopteris, or to Metaxyaceae is weakly supported.\nOur results show that Dicksoniaceae and Cyatheaceae, as currently\nrecognised, are not monophyletic and new circumscriptions for these\nfamilies are needed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tree ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_907.phy"}]}
