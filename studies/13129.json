This\nnew lambeosaurine hadrosaurid is characterized by a jugal combining a\nhook-like dorsal edge of the posterior process and a narrow, D-shaped\ninfratemporal fenestra. Blasisaurus differes from Arenysaurus from the\nBlasi 3 site of Aréen mainly by the absence of secondary ridges in the\ndentary teeth, and from Koutalisaurus (probably a junior synonym of\nPararhabdodon) from the Isona region of Lleida by the anteriormost\nportion of the dentary that is modestly deflected ventrally. A\nphylogenetic analysis places Blasisaurus as closely related to\nArenysaurus in a clade of basla lambeosaurines more derived than\nTsintaosaurus and Jaxartosaurus; this clade forms part of a polytomy\nwith Amurosaurus and with more derived lambeosaurines.\nPalaeobiogeographically, the presence of Blasisaurus and other\nhadrosaurids in the Maastrichtian European archipelago suggests one or,\nmore probably, a series of dispersal events from Asia across\nintermittent land bridges during the second half of the Late\nCretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"hadrosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55555.phy"}]}
