Molecular evidences here\nshown will resolve the relationship of the genus Phaeochorella with\nPhyllachorales, and other Sordariomycetes based on a multilocus analysis\nusing sequences of the nuclear rDNA (nuclear large subunit 28S and\nnuclear internal transcribed spacer ITS), the DNA-directed RNA\npolymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and the 1-Î± translation\nelongation factor (TEF1) genomic loci. The phylogenetic analysis\nindicated that Phaeochorella belongs in the Diaporthales instead of\nPhyllachorales. Phaeochorella parinarii, the type species of the genus,\nalso present in native hosts from the Brazilian Cerrado, formed a unique\nclade with high support with Phaeoappendicospora species. Thus, a new\nfamily Phaeochorellaceae, including both genera, is herein presented.\nExcept for P. zonata, the other species previously considered as\nbelonging to Phaeochorella (P. artocarpi, P. ciliata, P. machaerii) were\nexcluded from the genus after an appropriate taxonomic treatment","trees":[{"tree_label":"diaporthales phylogram BI","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114238.phy"}]}
