Sequence analysis of\nthe SSU region of nrDNA, revealed the genus Phaeoisariopsis to be\nindistinguishable from other hyphomycete anamorph genera of\nMycosphaerella, namely Pseudocercospora and Stigmina. A new combination\nis therefore proposed in the genus Pseudocercospora, a name to be\nconserved over Phaeoisariopsis and Stigmina. Further comparisons by\nmeans of morphology, cultural characteristics, and DNA sequence analysis\nof the ITS, calmodulin, and actin gene regions delineated two groups\nwithin P. griseola, which are recognised as two formae, namely\nf. griseola and f. mesoamericana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeoisariopsis griseola, 1 of 13 MPTs from ITS\ndata.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2484.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeoisariopsis griseola, 1 of 15 MPTs from SSU\ndata.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2483.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeoisariopsis griseola, 1 of 3 MPTs from ITS, actin\nand calmodulin data.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2485.phy"}]}
