Here, we identified four unique\nmbf1 genes in the lichenized fungi Endocarpon spp. A phylogenetic\nanalysis based on protein sequences showed the translated MBF1 proteins\nof the newly isolated mbf1 genes formed a monophyletic clade different\nfrom other lichen-forming fungi and Ascomycota groups in general, which\nmay reflect the evolution of the biological functions of MBF1s. In\ncontrast to the lack of function reported in yeast, we determined that\nlysine114 in the deduced Endocarpon pusillum MBF1 protein (EpMBF1) had a\nspecific function that was triggered by environmental stress. Further,\nthe Endocarpon-specific C-terminus of EpMBF1 was found to participate in\nstress tolerance. Epmbf1 was induced by a number of abiotic stresses in\nE. pusillum and transgenic yeast, and its stress-resistant ability was\nstronger than that of the yeast mbf1. These findings highlight the\nevolution and function of EpMBF1 and provide new insights into the\nco-evolution hypothesis of MBF1 and TATA-box-binding proteins.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110470.phy"}]}
