The oomycete Phytophthora\ninfestans, the potato blight agent, is a largely biotrophic pathogen\nthat feeds from living host cells, which become necrotic only late in\ninfection. The related oomycete Pythium ultimum grows saprophytically in\nsoil and as a necrotroph in plants, causing massive tissue destruction.\nTo learn what distinguishes their lifestyles, we compared their gene\ncontents and expression patterns in media and a shared host, potato\ntuber. Results: Genes related to pathogenesis varied in temporal\nexpression pattern, mRNA level, and family size between the species. A\nfamilyâ€™s aggregate expression during infection was not proportional to\nsize due to transcriptional remodeling and pseudogenization. Ph.\ninfestans had more stage-specific genes, while Py. ultimum tended\ntowards more constitutive expression. Ph. infestans expressed more genes\nencoding secreted cell wall-degrading enzymes, but other categories such\nas secreted proteases and ABC transporters had higher transcript levels\nin Py. ultimum. Species-specific genes were identified including new\nPythium genes, perforins, which may disrupt plant membranes. Genome-wide\northolog analyses identified substantial diversified expression, which\ncorrelated with sequence divergence. Pseudogenization was associated\nwith gene family expansion, especially in gene clusters. Conclusion:\nThis first large-scale analysis of transcriptional divergence within\noomycetes revealed major shifts in genome composition and expression,\nincluding subfunctionalization within gene families. Biotrophy and\nnecrotrophy seem determined by species-specific genes and the varied\nexpression of shared pathogenicity factors, which may be useful targets\nfor crop protection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"original","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106956","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106956.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 8+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106963","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106963.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 2+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106957","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106957.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 3+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106958","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106958.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 4+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106959","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106959.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 5+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106960","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106960.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 6+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106961","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106961.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 7+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106962","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106962.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106955","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106955.phy"},{"tree_label":"Rooting 9+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106964","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106964.phy"}]}
