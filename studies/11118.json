We tested the phylogenetic utility of five nuclear loci\nacross the species-rich legume clade Hologalegina: PGDH, TRPT, HRIP,\nRNAR, and CNGC4 (CNGC4-like protein). Our objective was to determine\nwhether any of these nuclear loci could be beneficial at resolving\nlower-level phylogenetic relationships in this clade, with a particular\ninterest in finding markers that might work at the species level. While\nthe phylogenetic utility of these nuclear loci is unknown outside of\nHologalegina, we determined that two of the loci, PGDH and TRPT, are\nuseful for phylogenetic analyses within Hologalegina, depending upon the\ndesired scale of resolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hologalegina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hologalegina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26493.phy"}]}
