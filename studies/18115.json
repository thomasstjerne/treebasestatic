The\nmtDNA of K. sudhausi is comprised of 16,005 bp that includes 36 genes\n(12 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 22 transfer RNA\ngenes) encoded in the same direction. Phylogenetic trees inferred from\namino acid and nucleotide sequence data for the 12 protein-coding genes\nstrongly supported the sister relationship of K. sudhausi with\nPristionchus pacificus, supporting Diplogasteromorpha. The gene order of\nK. sudhausi is identical to that most commonly found in members of the\nRhabditomorpha+Ascaridomorpha+Diplogasteromorpha clade, with an\nexception of some tRNA translocations. Both the gene order pattern and\nsequence-based phylogenetic analyses support a close relationship\nbetween the diplogasterid species and Rhabditomorpha. The nesting of the\ntwo diplogasteromorph species within Rhabditomorpha is consistent with\nmost molecular phylogenies for the group, but inconsistent with certain\nmorphology-based hypotheses that asserted phylogenetic affinity between\ndiplogasteromorphs and tylenchomorphs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig S4","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML of amino acid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89832.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI of nucleotide","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89833.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI of nucleotide excluded third codon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89835.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhabditomorpha BI of amino acid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhabditomorpha ML of nucleotide","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S6","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhabditomorpha ML of nucleotide excluded third\ncodon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89836.phy"}]}
