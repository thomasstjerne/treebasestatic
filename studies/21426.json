Based on morphological characters and phylogeny analysis\ninferred from ITS rDNA gene sequences, species is compared with related\nspecies in subsection Nivei. With veil characters (sub) golobose\nelements and densely elongate diverticulate hyphae, long ellipsoid\nbasidiospores, small size golobose cheilocystidia and lack of\npleurocystidia, C. yokdonensis species can be classified. In phylogeny\nanalysis, C. yokdonensis comes close to C. nivei and C. igarashii but\nthese species differ in veil characters and existing of\npleurocystidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 4.","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106352.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106353","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_106353.phy"}]}
