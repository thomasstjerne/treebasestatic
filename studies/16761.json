Based on the multi-locus(ACT, CAL, GAPDH,\nGS, ITS, TUB2) phylogenetic analysesand phenotypic characters, 11\nspecies weredistinguished, including ninewell-characterisedspecies\n(i.e., C. alienum, C. boninense, C. cliviae, C. fioriniae, C.\nfructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. siamense), one which was\nepitypified (C. camelliae), and two novel species (C. henanense and C.\njiangxiense). Of these, C. camelliae proved to be the most dominant\nandprobably host specifictaxon occurring on Camellia. Colletotrichum\njiangxienseis shown to be phylogenetically closely related to the coffee\nberry pathogen C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.Pathogenicity testsand pairwise\nhomoplasy index test suggest that C. jiangxiense and C. kahawae subsp.\nkahawae are two independent species. This study represents the first\nreports of C. alienum and C. cliviae occurring on Camellia sinensis. In\naddition, our study demonstrated that the combineduse of ApMat and GS\nloci in phylogenetic analysis is able to resolve all currently accepted\nspecies in the C. gloeosporioides species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 1 ACT CAL GAPDH ITS TUB2 GS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"317","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 3 & Fig. S2 apmat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 2 act gapdh its tub","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79981.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 2 act gapdh its tub","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79982.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"159","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 4 apmat Gus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. S1 ACT CAL GAPDH ITS TUB GS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94202.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"317","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum Fig. 3 & Fig. S2 apmat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79985.phy"}]}
