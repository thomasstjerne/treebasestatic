A phylogenetic analysis based on five genes (ITS, GPDH, Alt a1,\nRPB2 and TEF1) indicated that the species was closely related with\nAlternaria deserticola but clearly fell into distinct evolutionary taxa.\nThey were significantly different from each other based on cultural\nfeatures on SNA and PCA. Besides, A. deserticola was morphologically\nconsidered as A. acalyphicola and separated as a single species based on\nmulti-gene sequence analysis. In the result of conidial characters, the\nspecies was distinct from A. acalyphicola in conidia shape, size and\ntransverse septa. Pathogenicity tests indicated that it could induce\nnecrotic symptoms on its host. In a word, the species was illustrated\nhere a new species, Alternaria hydrangeae caused leaf spot on H.\npaniculata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria hydrangeae new sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115858.phy"}]}
