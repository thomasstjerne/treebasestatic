In a survey\non oak decline, 57 Biscogniauxia isolates were obtained from infected\ntwigs and trunks of oak trees showing decline symptoms in Zagros\nforests, west of Iran. Based on morphology, cultural characteristics and\nDNA sequences data (ITS region and part of the Î²-tubulin gene) isolates\nwere characterized as Biscogniauxia rosacearum and Obolarina persica.\nPathogenicity test of B. rosacearum and O. persica on 2-year-old potted\nhealthy oak seedlings confirmed the pathogenicity of both species on\nQuercus brantii. We report B. rosacearum for the first time on Q.\nbrantii, Q. infectoria and Q. libani in the world. Furthermore, O.\npersica is reported for the first time on Q. libani and from West\nAzarbaijan Province. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, four species in\ntwo genera Camillea (C. obularia and C. tinctor) and Obolarina (O.\ndryophila and O. persica) are transferred to the genus Biscogniauxia\nKuntze and two new combinations Biscogniauxia tinctor and Biscogniauxia\npersica are introduced.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con50majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135480","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135480.phy"},{"tree_label":"con50majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135481","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135481.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135482","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135482.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135483","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135483.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135484","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135484.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135485","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135485.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135486","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135486.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135487","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135487.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135488","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135488.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135489","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135489.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135490","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135490.phy"},{"tree_label":"con50majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135491","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135491.phy"},{"tree_label":"con50majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135492","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135492.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135493.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135478","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135478.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135479","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135479.phy"}]}
