Recent molecular phylogenetic studies using the mitochondrial\nmatR gene placed Rafflesia, Rhizanthes and Sapria (Rafflesiaceae s.\nstr.) in the angiosperm order Malpighiales and Mitrastema\n(Mitrastemonaceae) in Ericales. These phylogenetic studies did not,\nhowever, sample two additional groups traditionally classified within\nRafflesiales (Apodantheaceae and Cytinaceae). Here we provide molecular\nphylogenetic evidence using DNA sequence data from mitochondrial and\nnuclear genes for representatives of all genera in Rafflesiales. Results\nOur analyses indicate that the phylogenetic affinities of the\nlarge-flowered clade and Mitrastema, ascertained using mitochondrial\nmatR, are congruent with results from nuclear SSU rDNA when these data\nare analyzed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The\nrelationship of Cytinaceae to Malvales was recovered in all analyses.\nRelationships between Apodanthaceae and photosynthetic angiosperms\nvaried depending upon the data partition: Malvales (3-gene),\nCucurbitales (matR) or Fabales (atp1). The latter incongruencies suggest\nthat horizontal gene transfer (HGT) may be affecting the mitochondrial\ngene topologies. The lack of association between Mitrastema and Ericales\nusing atp1 is suggestive of HGT, but greater sampling within eudicots is\nneeded to test this hypothesis further. Conclusion Rafflesiales are not\nmonophyletic but composed of three or four independent lineages\n(families): Rafflesiaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Apodanthaceae and\nCytinaceae. Long-branch attraction appears to be misleading parsimony\nanalyses of nuclear small-subunit rDNA data, but model-based methods\n(maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses) recover a topology that is\ncongruent with the mitochondrial matR gene tree, thus providing\ncompelling evidence for organismal relationships. Horizontal gene\ntransfer appears to be influencing only some taxa and some mitochondrial\ngenes, thus indicating that the process is acting at the single gene\n(not whole genome) level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_231.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1993.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1995.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional File 2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1996.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional File 4","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1997.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional File 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1994.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional File 3","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rafflesiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1998.phy"}]}
