In culture studies, this fungus\nwas revealed to produce ascomycete [or ascomycetous] teleomorph\nstructures. Molecular phylogenetic study and morphological observation\nshowed this fungus is a new species of the genus Teratosphaeria\n(Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes) and is phylogenetically close to\nAcidomyces acidophilus and Bispora sp., which were previously reported\nas acidophilic anamorphic fungi. This new fungus is described here as a\nnew species of Teratosphaeria and its physiological properties adapting\nto its habitat are demonstrated. This is the first report of\nteleomorphic fungus having highly acidophilic and thermophilic\nproperties.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Teratosphaeria acidotherma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9372.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Teratosphaeria acidotherma","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9373.phy"}]}
