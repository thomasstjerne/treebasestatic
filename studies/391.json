The fifteen fungal isolates\nsequenced herein were obtained during a fungal biodiversity survey of\ntropical soils or from the collections of R. T. Hanlin. Fifteen species\nwere selected from the published data. The aligned sequences of the\n5*portion of the 18S ribosomal DNA were analyzed to infer the\nphylogenetic relationships among Chaetomium and related genera. The\nsequence data confirmed the generic entity of Achaetomium and placed\nAscotricha within the Xylariaceae. The analyses also defined the\nmonophyletic lineage of the Microascaceae and the evolutionary linkages\nbetween the families Sordariaceae and Chaetomiaceae. The placement of\nConiochaeta in the Coniochaetaceae and Chaetomium and Achaetomium in the\nChaetomiaceae, under the order Sordariales, is supported by this\nstudy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetomium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3338.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetomium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3339.phy"}]}
