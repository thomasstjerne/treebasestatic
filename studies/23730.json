Tamhinispora\nsaraburiensis is characterized as dark brown to black, obpyriform, and\ndictyoseptate and has conidia with long appendages arising from the\nconidial tip. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined ITS and LSU rDNA\nsequence data demonstrated that this species formed distinctly from\nother species and that it belongs in the family Tubeufiaceae.\nTamhinispora saraburiensis is therefore introduced here with a\ndescription, morphological illustrations and molecular data. A key to\nthe species of Tamhinispora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115288","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115288.phy"}]}
