Now referred to a single species, Psittacosaurus\nmongoliensis, these remains include a growth series from hatchlings to\nadults. In subsequent years, 15 species have been added to the genus\nPsittacosaurus and a second genus, Hongshanosaurus, was recently\ndescribed, all from Early Cretaceous rocks in Asia. Although the second\ngenus and about one-half of the species attributed to Psittacosaurus are\npotentially invalid, Psittacosaurus remains the most species-rich\ndinsaurian genus, with interspecific variation concentrated in the skull\nand dentition. This paper reviews evidence differentiating the named\ngenera and species of psitacosaurs, outlines major cranial changes in a\ngrowth series from hatchling to adult in Psittacosaurus mongoliensis,\nand provides evidence of two species groups within the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 2.23 E","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psittacosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55885.phy"}]}
