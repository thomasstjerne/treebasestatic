According to the recent cladistic analyses\nof the Polytrichales, Pogonatum is among the youngest lineages of the\norder together with Polytrichastrum, Polytrichum and Eopolytrichum.\nPhylogenetic analyses of Pogonatum were conducted using morphology and\nsequence data from the chloroplast rps4 and the trnL-F gene regions,\nplus the nuclear-encoded ITS2. Our analyses included all known species\nof the genus (16 of them represented only by morphology) plus 18 species\nfrom other polytrichalean genera used as outgroups. Phylogenetic trees\nwere constructed with simultaneous parsimony analyses of all sequences\nplus morphology. Analyses were performed both on a reduced data matrix\nwith ambiguously aligned regions deleted, and using direct optimization\nusing all available data. Our results confirm inclusion of Pogonatum\nsinense and species of Racelopus-group within Pogonatum. Our results do\nnot lend support for earlier division to four subgenera as currently\ndelimited although some of the species-groups are similar, or partly\nsimilar with those based on morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 tree 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pogonatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4423.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 tree 1","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pogonatum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4424.phy"}]}
