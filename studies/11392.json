A controversial proposal is that most\nchanges in genome size are initially deleterious and therefore are\nlinked to episodes of decrease in effective population sizes. Support\nfor this hypothesis comes from large-scale comparative analyses, but\nvanishes when phylogenetic nonindependence is taken into account.\nAnother approach to test this hypothesis involves analyzing sequence\nevolution among clades where duplications have recently fixed. Here we\nshow that episodes of fixation of duplications in mitochondrial genomes\nof the gecko Heteronotia binoei (2 independent clades) and of mantellid\nfrogs (5 distinct branches) coincide with reductions in the ability of\nselection to purge slightly deleterious mutations. Our results support\nthe idea that genome complexity can arise through nonadaptive processes\nin tetrapods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronotia Dataset 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43204.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1c","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mantellid Frogs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43205.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"215","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronotia Dataset 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43898.phy"}]}
