We investigated the importance\nof this connection for Neotropical fishes using peacock cichlids (Cichla\nspp.) as a model system. We tested whether the Casiquiare provides a\nconduit for gene flow between contemporary populations, and investigated\nthe origin of biogeographic distributions that span the Casiquiare.\nUsing sequences from the mitochondrial control region of three focal\nspecies (C. temensis, C. monoculus, and C. orinocensis) whose\ndistributions include the Amazonas, Orinoco, and Casiquiare, we\nconstructed maximum likelihood phylograms of haplotypes and analyzed the\npopulations under an isolation-with-migration coalescent model. Our\nanalyses suggest that populations of all three species have experienced\nsome degree of gene flow via the Casiquiare. We also generated a\nmitochondrial genealogy of all Cichla species using >2000 bp and\nperformed a dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) to reconstruct the\nhistorical biogeography of the genus. This analysis, when combined with\nthe intraspecific results, supports two instances of dispersal from the\nAmazonas to the Orinoco. Thus, our results support the idea that the\nCasiquiare connection is important across temporal scales, facilitating\nboth gene flow and the dispersal and range expansion of species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cichla","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6799.phy"}]}
