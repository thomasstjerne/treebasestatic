The sexual morph develops\nmulti-locular perithecial stromata and produce hyaline apiospores\nusually surrounded by a thick gelatinous sheath. Four Arthrinium species\ncollected in Kunming, China, are described and illustrated in this\npaper. Based on the morphology and DNA sequence data of the internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS) and 5.8S rRNA gene of the nrDNA, two new\nspecies Arthrinium garethjonesii and A. neosubglobosa are introduced,\ntogether with descriptions of sexual morphs of two hitherto described\nspecies, A. hydei and A. hyphopodii. Phylogenetically close taxa and\nmorphologically similar species are discussed","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Arthirinium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110628.phy"}]}
