The Italian Peninsula is considered to be one of the principal\nglacial refugia in Europe but few plant population genetic and\nphylogeography studies have been undertaken in this region. The combined\nanalysis of chloroplast and nuclear loci (ITS, cpSSR and ISSR) enabled\nus to detect extensive DNA variation and proved to be a very powerful\ntool for the reconstruction of the phylogeography. Molecular data\nsupport the hypothesis of a long-term separation of the North Western\n(Maritime Alps, Sardinia, Corsica, Northern Apennines) and South Eastern\n(Southern Apennines and Balkan area) lineages in glacial refugia. The\nexistence of allopatrically fragmented lineages is most probably the\nresult of isolation in different glacial refugia, possibly due to the\nLast Glacial Maximum cooling and the topographic complexity of the\nItalian peninsula. The most plausible hypothesis assumes the formation\nof two migration paths during more recent periods: the first one\nstarting with southward migration and the second one moving northwards.\nThe Central Apennines should be considered the confluence of migration\nroutes radiating from separate refugia according to this\nhypothesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbia spinosa Chronogram","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum 45","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49540.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum 49","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Uniform 45-49","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49538.phy"},{"tree_label":"Minimum 45","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49537.phy"},{"tree_label":"Minimum 49","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49536.phy"}]}
