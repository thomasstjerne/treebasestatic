The diversity of 64\nAustralian isolates of Xanthomonas spp. associated with bacterial leaf\nspot in tomato, capsicum and chilli crops in eastern Australia was\ndetermined using multi-locus sequence analysis of atpD, dnaK, efp and\ngyrB genes, species-specific PCR assays and biochemical analyses. At\nleast five species of Xanthomonas associated with bacterial leaf spot\nwere identified in Australian tomato, capsicum and chilli crops.\nPhylogenetic and biochemical analyses identified Xanthomonas arboricola,\nX. euvesicatoria, X. perforans and X. vesicatoria as the most frequently\nrecovered species. A genetically distinct clade of Xanthomonas sp.\nsister to X. arboricola was identified by phylogenetic analysis and\nrepresents a novel species. The suitability of the identification\nmethods used and the implications of the detection of these species will\nbe discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108558","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108558.phy"}]}
