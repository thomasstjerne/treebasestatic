To characterize algicolous fungal communities using\nculture dependent methods, macroalgae were collected from different\nsampling sites in the Ria de Aveiro estuary, Portugal. From a collection\nof 486 isolates that were obtained, 213 representative isolates were\nselected through microsatellite-primed PCR (MSP-PCR) fingerprinting\nanalysis. The collection yielded 33 different genera, which were\nidentified using the ITS region of the rDNA. The results revealed that\nthe most abundant taxa in all collections were Acremonium-like species:\nAlternaria, Cladosporium, Leptobacillium and Penicillium. The fungal\ncommunity composition varied with macroalgae species. Through multilocus\nphylogenetic analyses based on ITS, tub2, tef1-α and actA sequences, in\naddition to detailed morphological data, we propose Cladosporium rubrum\nsp. nov. (type strain=CMG 28=MUM 19.39) and Hypoxylon aveirense sp. nov.\n(type strain=CMG 29=MUM 19.40) as novel species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132752.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132753.phy"}]}
