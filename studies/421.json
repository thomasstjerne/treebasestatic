(Agaricaceae, Agaricales) were evaluated using parsimony\nanalyses of morphological and molecular characters. Thirty-eight\nmorphological characters were studied using macroscopic, microscopic,\nand biochemical analysis of fruit-body, basidiospores, and vegetative\ncultures. These characters were used in parsimony analysis of 25 species\nwithin Lepiota s. l., which represent a broad sampling within the six\nkey segregate genera recognized by Singer: Lepiota s. s., Cystolepiota,\nLeucocoprinus, Leucoagaricus, Macrolepiota, and Chlorophyllum. In\naddition, five other members of the Agaricales were evaluated from\nAgaricus, Cystoderma, and Ripartitella, as well as two dark-spored\nallies from Coprinus section Comati and a dark-spored secotioid\nrelative. Additional outgroups were used to evaluate the root of the\nphylogeny. Morphology-based analyses support the use of the Lepiota\nsegregate genera recognized by Singer that are included in the tribes\nLepioteae and Leucocoprineae, with two exceptions: Lepiota section\nEchinatae is in a clade with Cystolepiota, and Leucoagaricus appears\nparaphyletic. Molecule-based analyses using both nuclear and\nmitochondrial rDNA data provide less resolution but support the transfer\nof Lepiota section Echinatae to Cystolepiota and a paraphyletic\nLeucoagaricus, as well as a distinct Chlorophyllum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepiota sensu lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3437.phy"}]}
