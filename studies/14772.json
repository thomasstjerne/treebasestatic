In bipartite thalli,\ncyanobacteria can either be restricted to a well-delimited layer within\nthe thallus (‘pannarioid’ thalli) or spread over the thallus that\nbecomes gelatinous when wet (‘collematoid’ thalli).  We studied the\ncollematoid genera Kroswia and Physma and an undescribed tripartite\nspecies along with representatives of the pannarioid genera\nFuscopannaria, Pannaria and Parmeliella.
