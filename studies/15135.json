Studies exploring the\necology and biosystematics of thermophilic fungi have lagged behind\nstudies in applied biology. The species most recently known as\nScytalidium thermophilum (Chaetomiaceae) is one of the most frequently\nencountered organisms in surveys of thermophilic fungi. There is\nevidence that it is ecologically and economically important, for example\nin the context of commercial mushroom growing. As described here, this\nspecies should not be placed in the genus Scytalidium or any other\nexisting genus. We propose a new genus and combination, Mycothermus\nthermophilus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 3","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thermophilic fungi Beta Tubulin Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77500.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leotiomycetes ITS Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77498.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thermophilic fungi Three gene parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77502.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes ITS Parsimony","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77499.phy"}]}
