We investigated its phylogenetic\nrelationships within Elaphoglossum based on analyses of three\nnon-coding, plastid loci (trnL-trnF, rps4-trnS, atpB-rbcL) in 30 other\nspecies representative of the diversity of sections. Our results show\nthat E. nidusoides belongs to section Squamipedia. This is an unexpected\nphylogenetic position regarding the morphology of the new species, which\nexhibits short-creeping rhizomes, phyllopodia, fronds glabrous or nearly\nso, fronds more than 15 cm long, and lacks the characteristic peg-like\naerophores on the rhizome. Nevertheless, its position as sister-taxon to\nanother Malagasy species, E. marojejyense, is supported by the succulent\nfronds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaphoglossum nidusoides and Squamipedia Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_506.phy"}]}
