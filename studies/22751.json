Parietarieae is distributed in both of these floristically\nclosely related regions and contains two island endemic genera.\nGesnouinia is endemic to Macaronesia and was considered a Tertiary\nrelict from a European paleotropical vegetation. This, however, may\ncontradict the general idea of insular woodiness also proposed for this\ngenus. For the origin of the western Mediterranean island endemic\nSoleirolia, a vicariance scenario, i.e., the split of the Hercynian\nmassif in southern Europe has been suggested. To evaluate these\nhypotheses and to provide a time frame for island and inter-island\ncolonization, we applied molecular phylogenetics and dating based on two\nplastid and one nuclear DNA marker. Additionally, we performed ancestral\narea reconstruction, analyzed the anatomy of the stem and reconstructed\nthe ancestral character states of woodiness. Our results indicate that\nGesnouinia colonized Macaronesia during the Miocene via long-distance\ndispersal and may, therefore, be a Tertiary laurel forest relict.\nDiversification between the laurel forest species Gesnouinia arborea and\nthe rupicolous and more xeric G. filamentosa occurred within Macaronesia\nduring the Pleisto- cene, possibly due to climate fluctuations.\nTherefore, G. arborea is not a relict from the Tertiary. Stem anatomy\nsuggests that although woodiness in Gesnouinia likely is derived, it may\nhave evolved prior to island colonization. Soleirolia originated in the\nMediterranean during the Miocene. This rules out vicariance from the\nsplit of the Hercynian massif in southern Europe during the Oligocene.\nThe di- vergence of Soleirolia from Majorca, Corsica, Sardinia and the\nItalian mainland dates to the Pleistocene. This indicates long-distance\ndispersal as predominant colonization mode, not ruling out that\nmigration between these areas was possibly facilitated by land bridges\nduring the Pleistocene glaciation cycles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS MCC","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parietarieae ITS MCC BEAST perennial clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111992.phy"},{"tree_label":"consenus","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urticaceae trnLF matK MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112139.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urticaceae trnLF matK ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112140.phy"},{"tree_label":"con","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Urticaceae trnLF matK BEAST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112141.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF consensus tree 50 majority rule","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnLF MrBayes tree Urticaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112283.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF ML tree RAxML","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnLF ML tree Urticaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112284.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK consensus tree 50 majority rule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK MrBayes tree Urticaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112285.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK ML tree","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"matK ML tree Urticaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112286.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS consensus tree 50 majority rule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS MrBayes tree Parietarieae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112287.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parietarieae ITS ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112288.phy"}]}
