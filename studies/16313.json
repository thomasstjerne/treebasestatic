Here, we present one of the\nfirst, complete assessments of the geographic modes of speciation for\nthe flora of a small, oceanic island. Cocos Island (Costa Rica) is\npristine; it is located 550 km off the Pacific coast of Central America.\nIt harbours 189 native plant species, 33 of which are endemic. Using\nphylogenetic data from insular and mainland congeneric species, we show\nthat all of the endemic species are derived from independent\ncolonisation events rather than in situ speciation. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the results of a study carried out in a comparable system,\nLord Howe Island (Australia), where as much as 8.2% of the plant species\nwere the product of sympatric speciation. Differences in physiography\nand age between the islands may be responsible for the contrasting\npatterns of speciation observed. Importantly, comparing phylogenetic\nassessments of the modes speciation with taxonomy-based measures shows\nthat widely used island biogeography approaches overestimate rates of in\nsitu speciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"182","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77329","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77329.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77298","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77298.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77300.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77301","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77301.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77302.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77305","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77305.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77310","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77310.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77328.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77303","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77303.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77314","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77314.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77299","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77299.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77304.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77309","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77309.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77319","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77319.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77308","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77308.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77318","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77318.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77311","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77311.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77315","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77315.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77316","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77316.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77320","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77320.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"117","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77321.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"206","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77322.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77324","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77324.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77306.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77307","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77307.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77327.phy"}]}
