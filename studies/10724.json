We used DNA barcoding to\ninvestigate how inclusion of the often neglected adult females would\ninfluence the species count from springs and spring brooks at SÃ¸lendet\nNature Reserve in Central Norway. Using DNA barcodes we were able to\nassociate 77.6% of the females with males from the study site or other\nregions while the remainder were unlinked and could therefore only be\nidentified to genus level. Our results show that the number of recorded\nspecies increased by 27% when females were included. We also found that\nDNA barcoding is effective for the detection of taxonomically\nchallenging species and species groups. Using DNA barcoding in\ncombination with traditional taxonomy, we recognized at least five\nspecies new to science and three species and one genus new to\nNorway.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MB con","ntax":"402","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chironomidae, MB con all compat","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25388.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ K2P","ntax":"402","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chironomidae, NJ K2P boot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25387.phy"}]}
