Here, we reanalyze the 18S and 28S data\n(unaligned about 4.4 kb) using an objective and a semi-objective\nalignment approach, based on MAFFT and BAli-Phy, respectively.\nFurthermore, we present the first analyses of a substantial\nprotein-coding data set (4.6 kb from one mitochondrial and four nuclear\ngenes). Our results indicate that previous studies may have suffered\nfrom inflated support values due to subjective alignment of the\nribosomal sequences, but apparently not from significant biases. The\nprotein data provide independent confirmation of several earlier\nresults, including the monophyly of non-xyelid hymenopterans,\nPamphilioidea + Unicalcarida, Unicalcarida, Vespina, Apocrita,\nProctotrupomorpha and core Proctotrupomorpha. The protein data confirm\nthat Aculeata are nested within a paraphyletic Evaniomorpha, but cast\ndoubt on the monophyly of Evanioidea. Combining the available\nmorphological, ribosomal and protein-coding data, we examine the\ntotal-evidence signal as well as congruence and conflict among the three\ndata sources. Despite an emerging consensus on many higher-level\nhymenopteran relationships, several problems remain unresolved or\ncontentious, including rooting of the hymenopteran tree, relationships\nof the woodwasps, placement of Stephanoidea and Ceraphronoidea, and the\nsister group of Aculeata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"EF1a F2 con 50 majrule","ntax":"118","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60751","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60751.phy"},{"tree_label":"rRNA BAliPhy","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60758","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60758.phy"},{"tree_label":"Protein coding Amino Acids","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60757","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60757.phy"},{"tree_label":"Protein coding 1st and 2nd codon position","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60756","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60756.phy"},{"tree_label":"Molecular MAFFT con 50 majrule","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60753","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60753.phy"},{"tree_label":"Molecular BAliPhy con 50 majrule","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60752","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60752.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a F1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60750","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60750.phy"},{"tree_label":"CO1 con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60749","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60749.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAD con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60748","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60748.phy"},{"tree_label":"POL con 50 majrule","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60755","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60755.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology con 50 majrule","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60754","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60754.phy"},{"tree_label":"rRNA MAFFT","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60763","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60763.phy"},{"tree_label":"TE MAFFT","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60762","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60762.phy"},{"tree_label":"TE BAliPhy","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60761","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60761.phy"},{"tree_label":"Protein coding all codon positions","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60759","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60759.phy"}]}
