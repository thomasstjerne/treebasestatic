The fourth intron of the rhodopsin gene (567bp)\nand partial sequence of the second intron of the vimentin gene (403bp)\nwere used to assess phylogenetic relationships among 20 species of\nCtenomys and 3 octodontid species. The main groups of Ctenomys species\npreviously reported in the literature (e.g. the ìboliviensisî and the\nìmendocinusî groups) are confirmed, as is the lack of resolution of\nbasal nodes. This star-like pattern of diversification of tuco-tucos\nrelative to their sister taxon, the octodontids, was evaluated with the\nnew nuclear dataset and an expanded mitochondrial dataset, providing\nfurther and independent evidence that Ctenomys underwent a phase of\nrapid diversification early in its history.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ctenomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_292.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ctenomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4387.phy"}]}
