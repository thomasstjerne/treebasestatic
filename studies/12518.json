It is\nconsidered to pose a serious threat to melon (Cucumis melo) production\nin Italy. In the present study, an intensive sampling of diseased\ncucurbits as well as tomato and bell pepper was done and the fungal\npathogens present on them were isolated. Phylogenetic relationships of\nthe isolates were determined through a study of ribosomal RNA gene\nsequences (ITS cluster and D1/D2 domain of the 28S rRNA gene). Combining\nmorphological, culture and molecular data, six species were\ndistinguished. One of these (Pa. cucumerina) is already known. Four new\nspecies are described as Plectosphaerella citrullae, Pa. pauciseptata,\nPa. plurivora, and Pa. ramiseptata. Acremonium cucurbitacearum is shown\nto be a synonym of Nodulisporium melonis and is transferred to\nPlectosphaerella as Plectosphaerella melonis comb. nov. A further three\nknown species of Plectosporium are recombined in Plectosphaerella.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella D1D2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51735.phy"},{"tree_label":"D1D2 Bayesian","ntax":"102","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella D1D2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51736.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51738.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51756.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51752.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51743.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51754.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51737.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51742.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51755.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51739.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51740.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51741.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51744.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51745.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51746.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51747.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51748.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51749.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51750.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51751.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Plectosphaerella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51753.phy"}]}
