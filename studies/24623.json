The species delimitation was based on concordance\nof gene genealogies. The Pygmaeomyces cultures were isolated from the\nroots of mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) and pitch pine (Pinus\nrigida) from the acidic and oligotrophic New Jersey Pygmy Pine Plains\nhowever; they probably have a broader distribution because their\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences have high similarity with a\nnumber of environmental sequences from multiple independent studies.\nBased on the phylogeny and phenotypical characters, a new family\nPygmaeomyceceae is proposed to accommodate this new lineage in\nMucoromycotina. Results from this work will facilitate ecological and\nevolutionary studies on root-associated fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces RPB2 tree","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118679","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118679.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces ITS environmental tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118680","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces 3-gene tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123836","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces LSU 5-2020 tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123837","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces RPB2 5-2020 tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123835","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123835.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces ACT tree","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118678","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces 2 gene tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118684","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces 28S tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118683","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pygmaeomyces SSU tree","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123834","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123834.phy"}]}
