The isolates were divided into three\ndistinct clades which exhibited significant geographic isolation. Clade\nI consisted of isolates from North and South America while clade II\ncontained isolates from Asia and Australia. Also present in clade II was\nan isolate from a patient in United States, but the origin of infection\nmay in fact be in the Middle East. Clade III was comprised of isolates\nfrom Thailand and the United States. All 23 P. insidiosum isolates were\nmore closely related to each other than to any other Pythium species in\nthis study. Additionally, all Pythium isolates formed a clade separate\nfrom both outgroup species, Phytophthora megasperma and Lagenidium\ngiganteum. The ITS sequence results tend to support evidence for\ngeographic variants within P. insidiosum or that P. insidiosum is in\nfact comprised of more than one species. As well, the sequence\ninformation obtained provides an abundance of molecular data for\napplications in the diagnosis of pythiosis and identification of P.\ninsidiosum from clinical samples.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium insidiosum, NJ ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_615.phy"}]}
