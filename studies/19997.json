They typically produce basidiomes in\nthe spring and summer. Only one species, C. colymbadinus, is widespread,\noccurring in Europe and North America, but has not been reported from\nthe mountains of California. Cortinarius bridgei, C. flavobasilis, C.\nrumoribrunsii, C. vernalishastensis, and C. vernalisierraensis are new\nspecies. The first two are found throughout the western mountains, while\nthe latter three are known only from California. Cortinarius ahsii, a\ncommon species in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, also has\nnot been recorded from California. Early work on these species was done\nby K. H. McKnight, M. M.
