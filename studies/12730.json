Nelsen,\nLücking & Rivas Plata is proposed. This taxon lacks ascomata and\nproduces unique isidia-like structures for vegetative dispersal. Its\nsystematic position was clarified by incorporating molecular sequence\ndata from the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribo¬somal DNA (mtSSU)\nand small and large subunits of the nuclear ribososomal DNA (nuSSU and\nnuLSU). Our phylogenetic hypotheses suggest this taxon is not part of\nHerpothallon in the class Arthoniomycetes, but is supported as a member\nof the genus Diorygma (Graphidaceae) in the class Lecanoromycetes. This\nagrees with morphological and chemical features of this species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diorygma, Broad Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52956.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diorygma, Broad Combined ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52955.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diorygma, Detailed Concatenated BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52959.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diorygma, Detailed Combined MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52958.phy"}]}
