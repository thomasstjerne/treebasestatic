Cladistic analyses of these\ndata indicate that several plastome groups correspond well to subtribes\nrecognized largely on the basis of morphological variation. Based on\nthese cpDNA data, the tribe as a whole does not appear to be\nmonophyletic, a result in accordance with current, morphologically-based\nhypotheses. Plastomes of several genera belonging to subtribes\nconsidered basal within Phaseoleae have as their sister groups plastomes\nof non-Phaseoleae tribes, notably Millettieae, the tribe considered to\nrepresent the ancestral stock from which diverse elements of Phaseoleae\nwere derived. More unexpectedly, plastomes of the tribe Desmodieae fall\nwithin the clade that includes the most derived chloroplast genomes of\nPhaseoleae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaseoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1546.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaseoleae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1547.phy"}]}
