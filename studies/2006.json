Monophyly of several widely\ndistributed genera was also tested and the biogeography of the subfamily\nwas inferred. The partitioned Bayesian analyses performed do not recover\na monophyletic Doryctinae, though the relationships involved were weakly\nsupported. Strong evidence was found for rejecting the monophylies of\nDendrosoter, Doryctes, Ontsira, Rhaconotus, and Spathius. A\ndispersal-vicariance analysis showed a strong geographical signal for\nthe taxa included, with molecular dating estimates for the origin of\nDoryctinae and its subsequent radiation occurring during the Eocene. The\ndivergence time estimates suggest that diversification in the subfamily\ncould have in part occurred due to the continental break-up events that\ntook place in the southern hemisphere, though more recent dispersal\nevents account for the current distribution of several widespread taxa.\nSeveral taxonomic inferences are made to the higher level classification\nof Doryctinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doryctinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2984.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Doryctinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2985.phy"}]}
