We\ntest these models using the largest of the species rich plant groups\nthat characterise the botanically diverse Cape Floristic Region (CFR):\nthe genus Erica L. We generate a novel phylogenetic hypothesis informed\nby nuclear and plastid DNA sequences of c. 60% of the c. 800 Erica\nspecies (of which 690 are endemic to the CFR), and use this to estimate\nclade ages (using RELTIME; BEAST), net diversification rates (GEIGER),\nand shifts in rates of diversification in different areas (BAMM; MuSSE).\nResults: The diversity of Erica species in the CFR is the result of a\nsingle radiation within the last c. 15 million years. Compared to\nancestral lineages in the Palearctic, the rate of speciation accelerated\nacross Africa and Madagascar, with a further burst of speciation within\nthe CFR that also exceeds the net diversification rates of other Cape\nclades. Conclusions: Erica exemplifies the “hotbed” model of assemblage\nthrough recent speciation, implying that with the advent of the modern\nCape a multitude of new niches opened and were successively occupied\nthrough local species diversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95026","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"612","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90783.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90787.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95024","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95024.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95025","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95025.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95023","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95023.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"611","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90784","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90784.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"597","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90786.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"595","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90788.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"596","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90785.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95021","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95021.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95020","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95020.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"556","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95019","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95019.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95018","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95018.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"556","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95017","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95017.phy"}]}
