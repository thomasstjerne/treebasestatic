The percentage of inhibition of\nradial growth values of L. gongylophorus were ranging from 58% to 69%\nand the average mean value of T. koningiopsis against all L.\ngongylophorus strains was 65%. In dual plate tests Trichoderma\nkoningiopsis proved to be an effective biocontrol agent against three\nLeucoagaricus gongylophorus strains from nest of leaf cutting ants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycoparasitic Trichoderma koningiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96276.phy"}]}
