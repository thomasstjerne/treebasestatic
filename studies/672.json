Trichoderma\naureoviride was isolated originally from a specimen identified as H.\naureoviridis and thus is H. aureoviridis. The morphological and\nmolecular characters of most strains identified as T. aureoviride differ\nfrom those of the ex-type but are more typical of T. harzianum, a member\nof sect. Pachybasium. Molecular data do not support inclusion of T.\naureoviride in sect. Trichoderma, nor was there strong phenotypic\nsimilarity between H. aureoviridis and H. rufa. In the ITS phylogeny the\nT. aureoviride ex-type and other collections of H. aureoviridis form a\nstrongly supported clade that is separate from any other recognized\nsection of Trichoderma. Hypocrea vinosa, which was originally included\nin the T. aureoviride aggregate species concept, is distinct from T.\naureoviride. but closely allied with H. rufa/T. viride. Trichoderma\naureoviride/H. aureoviridis is a rare species, restricted to the UK and\nthe Netherlands. We redefine T. aureoviride, limiting it to strains with\nvery slow growth rate, effuse conidiation, and the ITS-1 and 2 sequence\ntype D.","trees":[{"tree_label":"alt tree","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma aureoviride","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma aureoviride","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3673.phy"}]}
