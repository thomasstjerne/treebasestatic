This edible mushroom has macroscopic characteristics similar\nto those of Panus lecomtei. In this study, we used evidence obtained\nfrom a morphological comparison, molecular analyses and mating tests to\nclarify the taxonomic status of P. strigellus and show differences\ncompared to the sympatric species of Panus. In addition, this paper\ndiscusses and reports some yet to be described morphological\ncharacteristics of P. strigellus. The tetrapolar mating system of P.\nstrigellus and the incompatibility between P. lecomtei and P. strigellus\nwas confirmed. The geographical distributions of both species in the\nAmericas are presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61039","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61039.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61040.phy"}]}
