Overexpression of several of these genes results in similar\npleiotropic phenotypes: shortened rosette leaves and floral organs,\naltered silique development, and stalks at the base of pedicels and\ntrichomes. Silenced lines or insertional mutants have no noticeable\nphenotype. More than 20 DVL/RTFL genes have been identified in\nArabidopsis. The corresponding proteins (40-144 amino acids) share a\nhighly conserved region of 30 amino acids located close to the C\nterminus, which is sufficient for their function. The overexpression\nphenotypes might be explained by alterations in polarized cellular\nproliferation. The mechanism of action of these small proteins is\ncurrently unknown. They appear to be localized to the plasma membrane\nwhere they might interact with a receptor. DVL/RTFL overexpression\nalters a large number of genes involved in signaling pathways,\nparticularly in hormonal responses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"DVL in Arabidopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48608.phy"}]}
