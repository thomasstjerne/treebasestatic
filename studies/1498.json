New records include Pestalotiopsis\nmatildae, Sarcostroma lomatiae, Truncatella betulae and T. hartigii. To\nresolve generic affiliations, phylogenetic analyses were performed on\nITS (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2) and part of 28S rDNA. DNA data support the\noriginal generic concept of Truncatella, which encompases Pestalotiopsis\nspecies having 3-septate conidia. The genus Sarcostroma is retained as\nseparate from Seimatosporium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8 MP","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotioid fungi from Restionaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8b NJ","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotioid fungi from Restionaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9 MP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotioid fungi from Restionaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_924.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9b NJ","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pestalotioid fungi from Restionaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_925.phy"}]}
