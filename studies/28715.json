The phylogenetic analyses\ninferred from the combined dataset of ITS+LSU, show that\nSistotremastraceae forms a monophyletic lineage with high support within\nTrechisporales (100% BS, 100% BP, 1.00 BPP, Fig. 12). The new family is\ncharacterized by resupinate thin basidioma, smooth, verruculose or\nodontioid-semiporoid hymenophore, a monomitic hyphal structure, and\ngenerative hyphae bearing clamp connections, the presence of cystidia\nand hyphidia in some species, thin-walled, smooth, inamyloid and\nacyanophilous basidiospores. In addition, four new species are described\nand illustrated in this paper, i.e., Trechispora dentata, T. dimitiella,\nT. fragilis and T. levispora. Besides, three new combinations, i.e.,\nBrevicellicium daweishanensis, B. xantha and Sertulicium limonadense,\nare also proposed based on examination of type materials or phylogenetic\nanalyses of type sequences. Besides, two Trechispora spp. and one\nSistotremastrum sp. are proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133087","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133087.phy"}]}
