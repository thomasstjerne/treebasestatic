Together with interspecific reactions between the\nmycoparasites, it could be stated out, that (i) no differences are\nevident in the spectrum of non-parasitic hosts tested within this study,\n(ii) Absidia parricida parasitizes all other fusion parasites, (iii)\nAbsidia parricida is ancestral to all other parasites, (iv) Absidia\nparricida is reported for the first time as phylogenetically basal to\nall other mucoralean fungi except the Umbelopsidaceae, and (v) based on\nphylogenetic analyses as well as physiological and morphological\ncharacteristics the slow growing species Absidia parricida and Absidia\nzychae are removed from the genus Absidia and reclassified in the newly\ndescribed genus Lentamyces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 NJ","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5260.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MB","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5259.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 PD","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5258.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 ML","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5261.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 MP","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5262.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8 MB","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucorales, BayesTraits","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5263.phy"}]}
