It has been isolated from a large\ndiversity of natural sources, like fruit, air, water, soil, but most\nfrequently from processed food products. The classification of this\nyeast species urgently needs clarification. The heterogeneity in\ntaxonomic criteria has resulted in the description of varieties linked\nto D. hansenii. The aim of this study was to re-examine and classify D.\nhansenii using a polyphasic approach. A total of 65 Debaryomyces\nhansenii isolates were examined, 57 representing the variety hansenii\nand nine the variety fabryi. The selection of strains for whole genome\ncomparisons and phylogenetic analysis was based on polymerase chain\nreaction mediated fingerprints using four mini- and microsatellite\nspecific primers. The discriminating power of growth at 35°C and 37°C\nwas re-examined and ascospore production was observed. Whole genome\ncomparisons and phylogenetic analyses were performed on selected\nisolates from each of the clusters obtained from the DNA fingerprint\nanalyses. The data indicated the presence of three distinct species\nwithin the D. hansenii group, which were represented by type strains of\nformer species and that are proposed to be reinstated: D. hansenii (CBS\n767T=MUCL 49680T), D. fabryi (CBS 789T=MUCL 49731T) and D. subglobosus\n(CBS 792T=MUCL 49732T).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Debaryomyces hansenii strains, 1 of 2 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3064.phy"}]}
