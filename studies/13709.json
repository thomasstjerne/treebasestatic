In this\nissue, 21 Healy et al. (2012) make a great leap forward by describing\nand identifying asexual 22 anamorphic structures that produce mitotic\npropagules or spores in many ectomycorrhiza23 forming truffle and\nnon-truffle species on soil surfaces worldwide (Fig. 1). Although such\n24 anamorphic forms have been reported sporadically from certain\nectomycorrhizal and 25 saprotrophic Pezizomycetes (e.g. Warcup 1990),\nHealy et al. (2012) demonstrate that these 26 asexual forms are both\ntaxonomically and geographically more widespread and, in fact, 27 much\nmore common than previously understood. With a single exception,\nconspicuous 28 spore mats were found exclusively from ectomycorrhizal\ntaxa in natural habitats, implying 29 that asexual forms of saprotrophic\nspecies are minute or rarely induced in nature.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59318.phy"}]}
