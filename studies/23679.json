The two species are determined as distinct species\nbelonging into Sect. Radicina of Alternaria based on morphology and a\nmultigene analysis of ITS, EF-1α, RPB2 and ATPase sequences. Alternaria\nglehniae is illustrated here as a novel species because the conidial\nsize, septa and sporulation patterns are different from its closely\nrelated species. A. carotiincultae is also described as a new record in\nChina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria 123","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115131.phy"}]}
