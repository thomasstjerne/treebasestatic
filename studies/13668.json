The monophyly and intergeneric\nrelationships of this group have not been rigorously assessed. We\nestimated the phylogeny of Chlorogaloideae using four chloroplast DNA\nregions: rpl16 intron and trnDtrnYtrnEtrnT, psbJpetA, and trnStrnfM\nspacers, with the goals of evaluating 1) the monophyly of\nChlorogaloideae, 2) the monophyly of each genus and generic\ninterrelationships, 3) the placement of Chlorogaloideae in Agavaceae,\nand 4) the history of adaptation onto serpentine soils. Maximum\nparsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses provided concordant\nestimates of the phylogeny supporting the monophyly of a clade\nconsisting of Camassia, Chlorogalum, and Hastingsia, but suggest that\nSchoenolirion may be more closely related to Hesperoyucca and\nHesperaloe. Each genus of Chlorogaloideae was found to be monophyletic\nexcept Chlorogalum, with C. parviflorum and C. purpureum forming a\nparaphyletic grade to other Chlorogalum, Camassia, and Hastingia.\nAncestral character reconstructions employing parsimony, likelihood, and\nstochastic mapping suggest that serpentine tolerance evolved multiple\ntimes in Chlorogaloideae. We discuss the significance of the estimated\nphylogeny for the evolution of the distinctive bimodal karyotype of\nAgavaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree RaXML","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59083","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59083.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict consensus no indels","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59081","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59081.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict consensus with indels","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59080","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59080.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree GARLI","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59082","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes consensus 50% majority rule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr59084","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59084.phy"}]}
