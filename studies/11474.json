Climacium dendroides occurs around the globe at northern\nlatitudes with disjunct populations in Mexico and New Zealand, whereas\nC. americanum and C. kindbergii are endemic to eastern North America and\nC. japonicum is limited to eastern Asia. We tested the hypothesis that\nC. americanum and C. kindbergii from eastern North America have a sister\ngroup relationship with C. japonicum from eastern Asia. Phylogenetic\ninferences were based on nucleotide sequence data from five plastid loci\nplus the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. Climacium japonicum is resolved\nas sister to a clade containing C. dendroides, C. americanum, and C.\nkindbergii. Climacium americanum and C. kindbergii were not resolved by\nthe sequence data but a clade containing both taxa is sister to C.\ndendroides. Geographically disjunct populations of C. dendroides in\nAsia, Mexico, the United States, and Canada vary at only a few\npolymorphic nucleotide sites across the three loci. Nevertheless,\nphylogenetic analyses suggest some infraspecific geographic structure\nwith western North American and Australasian clades. The disjunctive New\nZealand plants of C. dendroides are related to Asian accessions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 0","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Climacium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_44921.phy"}]}
