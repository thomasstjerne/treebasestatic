It can\nbe distinguished from its closest morphological taxon, V. macrorhiza, by\nits entire, spathulate leaves with serrulate margin, and falcate fruits,\n22.5 mm long, crowned by the reduced annular calyx shifted toward the\nventral face. A phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences of plastid\nmarkers trnLF and trnK intron supported V. macrorhiza as its closest\nrelated species. We also provide a key to differentiate V. serratifolia\nfrom the epappose species of Valeriana from Argentina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Valeriana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112921.phy"}]}
