The aim of the present study was to characterize a collection\nof Cylindrocarpon-like isolates recovered from the roots of a broad\nrange of forest hosts from nurseries showing decline by morphological\nand molecular studies. Between 2009 and 2012, 17 forest nurseries in\nSpain were surveyed and a total of 103 Cylindrocarpon-like isolates were\nobtained. Isolates were identified based on DNA sequences of the partial\ngene regions histone H3 (his3). For the new species, the internal\ntranscribed spacer and intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS) region,\nβ-tubulin (tub2), and translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) were also\nused to determine their phylogenetic position. Twelve species belonging\nto the genera Cylindrodendrum, Dactylonectria, and Ilyonectria were\nidentified from damaged roots of 15 different host genera. The species\nC. alicantinum, D. macrodidyma, D. novozelandica, D. pauciseptata, D.\npinicola, D. torresensis, I. capensis, I. cyclaminicola, I. liriodendri,\nI. pseudodestructans, I. robusta, and I. rufa were identified. In\naddition, two Dactylonectria species (D. hispanica sp. nov. and D.\nvalentina sp. nov.), one Ilyonectria species (I. ilicicola sp. nov.),\nand one Neonectria species (N. quercicola sp. nov.) are newly described.\nThe present study demonstrates the prevalence of this fungal group\nassociated with seedlings of diverse hosts showing decline symptoms in\nforest nurseries in Spain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like btub RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109251.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like RaXML his3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109237.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like his3 MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109239.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule_his3_Fig2","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109238","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109238.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like ITS RaXML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109250.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like tef1 RaXML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109253.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like his3 RaXML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109252.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocarpon-like ITS btub his3 tef1 RaXML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109254.phy"}]}
