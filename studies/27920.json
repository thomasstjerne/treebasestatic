In Taiwan, a brown spot disease on the leaf was commonly\nfound in avocado orchards. From 2017 to 2019, sixty-three fungal\nisolates were collected from the brown spots or lesions on avocado\nleaves in five orchards located in Chiayi, Chunghua, and Tainan\nCounties, Taiwan. Ten isolates were selected and investigated through\nmorphological and phylogenetic analysis to clarify the identity of the\nfungus. The phylogenetic analysis based on ITS, LSU and TUB sequences\nshowed these fungal isolates formed a distinct clade with bootstrap\nvalue of 100% in both Maximum likelihood and Maximum parsimony analysis,\nand this clade resided within the genus Pseudoplagiostoma. Compared the\nmorphological traits in vivo and in vitro as well as phylogenetic\nrelatedness with the currently known eight Pseudoplagiostoma spp., the\nfungus was recognized and described as a new species, Pseudoplagiostoma\nperseae, and a key to the currently known nine Pseudoplagiostoma species\nwas provided. Pathogenicity test was conducted via Kochs postulate on\nfive avocado cultivars, namely ‘Hass’, ‘Pinkerton’, ‘Tainung No.1 Tasty\nRed’, ‘Tainung No.2 Green Gold’, as well as on ‘Hung Shin Yuan’, and\nleaf spots were found on the all five cultivars six weeks after\ninoculation. Kochs postulate validated that P. perseae is actually the\nnew causal agent of brown spot disease on avocado leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129500","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129500.phy"}]}
