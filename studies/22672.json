A polyphasic taxonomic approach comprising\nmorphylogical characters and molecular data (the nuclear large subunit\nribosomal DNA and the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene\nsequences) was applied to determine their novel taxonomic status in the\ngenus Conidiobolus. C. mirabilis is phylogenetically related to C.\nthromoides (ATCC12587), and differed from C. thromoides by the special\nformation of zygospores occuringamong 2-4 adjacent hyphal segments and\nsmaller primary conidia. C. pachyzygosporus with thick-walled zygospore\nlocated in a single clade in the phylogenetic tree. Both species are\ngenetically distinct from morphylogically related species revealed by\nphylogenetic analyses except C. lamprauges, C. multivagus and C.\nthermophilus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr111613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111613.phy"}]}
