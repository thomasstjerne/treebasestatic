Phalloideae (Fr.) Quél. are\nresponsible for many fatalities worldwide. However, some species in this\nsection have previously been reported as non-lethal and lacking deadly\ntoxins. Sequences of five genes (ITS, nrLSU, RPB2, TEF1-α, TUB2) of\nspecies belonging to the section from tropical Africa, America, Asia,\nAustralia, and Europe were included in this study to elucidate the\nphylogenetic relationships among the species. The results indicated that\nthe lethal species are in one clade (subclade I) while the non-lethal\nspecies are divided into two clades (subclade II and III) within the\nsection. Moreover, two non-lethal species from tropical Africa, namely\nA. ballerinoides and A. bulbulosa are newly described based on both\nmorphology and molecular approaches. Phylogenetically, they cluster in\nthe same subclade III with other known non-lethal amanitas, including A.\nballerina, A. chuformis, A. franzii, A. levistriata, and A.\npseudogemmata. Neither amatoxins nor phallotoxins were detected in A.\nballerinoides and A. bulbulosa by LC-HRMS, which agrees with their\nplacement in the non-lethal subclade III within A. sect. Phalloideae.\nFinally, a key to the West African species of Amanita sect. Phalloideae\nis provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita sect.
