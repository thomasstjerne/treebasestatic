Very\nlittle is known regarding the occurrence or diversity of these fungi in\nSouth America. The aim of this study was to consider their occurrence on\nnative Nothofagus trees in the Patagonian Andes of Argentina. Isolates\nwere collected in national parks and provincial reserves in Patagonia\nbetween 2009 and 2011. These were grouped based on morphology and 22\nrepresentative isolates were included in phylogenetic analyses based on\nsequence data of multiple loci (28S, ITS, BT, TEF). The isolates could\nbe assigned to ten different taxa and included eight species of\nOphiostoma s.l., one species of Leptographium, and one species in the S.\nlignivora complex. Three of the species are described as new, including\nOphiostoma patagonicum, Leptographium gestamen and Sporothrix cabralii.\nOphiostoma quercus and O. noveae-zelandiae are reported for the first\ntime from Argentina, and we show that the latter species is distinct\nfrom O. pluriannulatum, in contrast to previous suggestion that they are\nsynonymous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported
