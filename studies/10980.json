Recent collections on leaves of a\nleguminous host, Dimorphandra mollis, in Mato Grosso, Brazil, led to the\ndiscovery of a new species of Johansonia, described here as J.\nchapadiensis. Based on DNA sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal DNA\n(LSU), Johansonia is revealed to represent a member of Dothideomycetes,\nCapnodiales. Although its family could not be resolved, it clustered\nbasal to Schizothyriaceae and Mycosphaerellaceae, and could well\nrepresent a species of Saccardiaceae. DNA sequence data of other members\nof Saccardiaceae would be required, however, to confirm this\nclassification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"What is Johansonia?","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25510.phy"}]}
