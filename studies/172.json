A total of 783 cpDNA restriction sites\nwas surveyed using 22 restriction endonucleases, revealing 110\npolymorphic restriction sites among or within the species. We observed a\nrelatively low level of cpDNA sequence divergence among Tripsacum\nspecies (0.0 to 0.0036 substitutions per site) as compared to other\ngenera of flowering plants. The level of cpDNA sequence divergence\nbetween Zea and Tripsacum is also low (0.007 substitutions per site),\nsuggesting that these genera are closely related. Variable restriction\nsites were used to construct parsimony phylogenetic trees. These trees\nfailed to show close agreement with taxonomic relationships within\nTripsacum. The trees do not show a division of Tripsacum into sects.\nTripsacum and Fasciculata. Chloroplast DNA also indicates that T.\ndactyloides is not monophyletic. Comparison of cpDNA and rDNA\nrestriction site variation suggests that interspecific introgressive\nhybridization could explain the low level of congruence between taxonomy\nand cpDNA. Tests of the molecular clock hypothesis indicate that cpDNA\nevolves more rapidly in Zea than in Tripsacum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tripsacum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_542.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tripsacum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_541.phy"}]}
