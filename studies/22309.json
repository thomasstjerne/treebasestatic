We reconstructed the\nphylogeny using two distinct fungal barcoding markers (nr internal\ntranscriber spacer ITS and mt cytochrome oxidase subunit 3) and assessed\nthe value of morphological traits and geographic range as important\nfeatures for discriminating lineages. The morphology of the teliospore\npedicels and the rust speciesÂ’ geographic range explained the\nrelationships within this group where two major lineages were\ndistinguished. Four Puccinia species are recognized on Lycieae in the\nNew World lineage and four in the Old World lineage. Puccinia tumidipes\nfrom North America is resurrected, P. spinulosa from Madagascar is\nreduced to a synonym of P. engleriana and P. dimidipes is described from\nSouth America. Descriptions and identification key are presented for the\naccepted species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Puccinia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114174.phy"}]}
