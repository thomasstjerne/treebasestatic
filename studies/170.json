The former three species have allopatric distributions, occur\nin disturbed habitats, and are terrestrial. Heppiella repens is\nsympatric with H. ulmifolia and H. verticillata, occurs in mist forests,\nand is usually climbing and epiphytic. Heppiella has apparently\ndeveloped from ancestors close to Gloxinia, and this latter genus was\nused as an outgroup in a cladistic analysis. The only derived features\nthat the widespread and variable H. ulmifolia possesses are those that\ndistinguish Heppiella from Gloxinia. The three more restricted species\nhave no derived features in common, and have apparently evolved\nindependently from geographically isolated populations of H.\nulmifolia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heppiella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_181.phy"}]}
