From 2016 to 2021, a stem rot has been observed on\nA. longiloba in Guangdong Province, China. Once the disease becomes\nsevere plants wilted and died. A fungus was isolated from the diseased\nstem and identified as Fusarium elaeidis by both morphological\ncharacteristics and molecular analysis of RNA polymerase II second\nlargest subunit (rpb2), translation elongation factor-1α (tef1) gene,\nand beta-tubulin (tub2) gene. The pathogenicity test showed the fungus\nwas able to produce typical symptoms on A. longiloba as those in the\nfield. From inoculated plants pathogen was reisolated to confirm Kochs\npostulates. This is the first report of Fusarium elaeidis causing stem\nrot on A. longiloba. These results will provide and baseline to identify\nand control diseases associated with A. longiloba.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132043","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132043.phy"}]}
