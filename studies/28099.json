Three isolates were\nobtained from dead aerial stems of unknown hosts in three locations in\nGuizhou province, China. Though morphology assigned it to be a typical\nbotryosphaeriaceous species, a phylogenetic analyses based on a combined\nDNA dataset of large subunit (LSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nand a part of the elongation factor 1-α (tef) gene were carried out to\njustify their placement within Botryosphaeriaceae. The phylogenetic\nresult verified that three isolates of the present collection formed a\nwell-supported monotypic clade within the genus Sardiniella, and can be\nrecognized as a distinct lineage. Hence, the new collection is\nidentified as Sardiniella guizhouensis sp. nov. by providing detailed\ndescriptions and illustrations of both sexual and asexual morphs. This\nis the first study which reveal the sexual morph of the genus\nSardiniella, and the genus is characterized with 24(6)-spored asci. The\ninvestigations of Sardiniella species in both tropical and temperate\nregions are still needed as many novelties remain to be discovered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133944.phy"}]}
