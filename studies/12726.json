Several type collections were also examined. Four species\nwere identified: C. harrisonii sp. nov, C. neosanguineus sp. nov., C.\nsanguineus, and C. sierraensis comb. nov. Of these, C. sanguineus also\noccurs in Europe together with C. puniceus, a fifth member of the\nsection. Typical features of these species include Â± red, fairly small\nbasidiomata, stipe basal mycelium often with yellow to reddish yellow\ntints, amygdaloid to ellipsoid spores, and aniline-red lamellar trama\nand pileipellis hyphae when mounted in KOH. Two other species with red\nlamellae C. marylandensis comb. nov. and C. smithii stat. nov. &\nnom. nov. are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius section Sanguinei in North America","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52918.phy"}]}
