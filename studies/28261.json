The novel\nspecies is introduced based on the morpho-molecular approach.\nMorphologically, A. hongheensis fits well with Amphibambusa and is\ncharacterized by immersed, globose to subglobose ascomata, with\nprotruding carbonaceous papilla, unitunicate, cylindrical to elongate\nfusiform, subsessile to short pedicellate asci with a J+, subapical\nring, and fusiform, hyaline to pale brown, 1-septate ascospores,\nlongitudinally striated, and surrounded by a thick mucilaginous sheath.\nPhylogenetic analyses of a concatenated ITS-LSU sequence dataset based\non maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference criteria revealed the\nphylogenetic affinity of A. hongheensis within Cainiaceae (Xylariales,\nSordariomycetes). Amphibambusa hongheensis formed an independent\nsubclade sister to A. bambusicola with moderate support (81% ML, 0.96\nPP) and clustered with the genus Arecophila in Cainiaceae. Amphibambusa\nhongheensis is the second species accommodated in Amphibambusa and is\nreported from Yunnan, China, for the first time. Detailed description,\nillustration and updated phylogeny are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131078.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131079","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131079.phy"}]}
