Gymnosporangium corniforme has been demonstrated to\nhave its spermogonial and aecial host plant on Sorbus randaiensis by the\nmolecular characteristics and inoculation experiments. A pear rust\npathogen G. unicorne is detected with newly developed specific primers\nand the rust is first reported in Taiwan. Roestelia niitakayamensis sp.\nnov on leaves of Photinia niitakayamensis is distinct from other species\nby the presence of smooth outer wall, rugose side wall, and coralloid\nprojection inner wall on the peridial cells, and the echinulate\nprocesses on aeciospores using scanning electron microscopy.\nPhylogenetic relationships of the species are estimated from the\nsmall-subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA sequences, internal transcribed\nspacers (ITS), and large-subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_103656.phy"}]}
