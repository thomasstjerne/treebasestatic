Recent studies have claimed that rather\nthan the generally accepted date of ~3 million years ago (Ma), the\nIsthmus was effectively complete by the middle Miocene, 13 Ma. We\npresent a fossil calibrated phylogeny of the new world sand dollar genus\nEncope, based on one nuclear and four mitochondrial genes, calibrated\nwith fossils at multiple nodes. Present day distributions of Encope are\nlikely the result of multiple range contractions and extinction events.\nMost species are now endemic to a single region, but one widely\ndistributed species in each ocean is composed of morphotypes previously\ndescribed as separate species. The most recent separation between\neastern Pacific and Caribbean extant clades occurred at 4.90 Ma,\nindicating that the Isthmus of Panama allowed genetic exchange until the\nPliocene. The rate of evolution of mitochondrial genes in Encope has\nbeen ten times slower than in the closely related genera Mellita and\nLanthonia. This large difference in rates suggests that splits between\neastern Pacific and Caribbean biota, dated on the assumption of a\n“universal” mitochondrial DNA clock are not valid.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Encope concatenated COI, ATPase-6, ATPase-8, 16S and\n28S data","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106359.phy"}]}
