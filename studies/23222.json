Comparative morphology\nand phylogenetic analyses with 28S and ITS regions of rDNA showed that\nthese specimens belong to Pucciniastrum, although no telial stage was\nfound and they were different to Pucciniastrum species previously\nreported from the same host genera. Therefore, the rust fungus on Galium\nand another on Aster and Kalimeris are described as P. coronisporum, and\nP. verruculosum, respectively. Both new species are mainly characterized\nby having two types of uredinia producing morphologically different\nurediniospores, which are intermingled in most of the uredinia.\nPucciniastrum coronisporum has echinulate and coronate urediniospores,\nwhile those of P. verruculosum are echinulate and verrucose to\nnail-headed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pucciniastrum 28S alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117989.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pucciniastrum ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117990.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pucciniastrum 28S CT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117991.phy"}]}
