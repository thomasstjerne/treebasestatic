Four of these nine ICGs are partially compatible\nand belong to the H. crustuliniforme aggregate. Different levels of\npartial compatibility have been found between these four ICGs. Between\nICGs 3 and 4, 15% of the combinations were compatible. One strain was\ncompatible with all isolates of both ICGs 3 and 4 and also with one\nisolate of ICG 2. Both a nuclear phylogeny, based on ribosomal IGS\nsequence data, and a mitochondrial phylogeny, based on a group-I intron\nlocated in the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LrRNA), were\nreconstructed. The level of incompatibility was compared with the\nphylogenetic history of individuals belonging to this clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma crustuliniforme CTB Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3724.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hebeloma crustuliniforme IGS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3723.phy"}]}
