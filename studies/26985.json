Both species are morphologically distinct from\nall known species. Pythium monoclinum, sp. nov., is morphologically\ncharacterized by the pres¬ence of a swollen element in oogonial stalks\nbelow terminal oogonia, mostly monoclinous antheridia originating at\nvarious distances from the oogonia that occasionally arising from\ninflated part of oogo¬nial stalk and, rarely production of peanut-shaped\nand double oospores. Pythium iranense, sp. nov., is distinguished from\nother species of the genus by the production of smooth-walled oogonia\nthat occasionally have 1-3 papillae, globose to rarely elongated\noogonia, 1-2(-5) antheridia per oogonium or crowd of antheridia around\noogonia, 1-2 rarely 3-4 oospores per oogonium, rarely peanut-shaped\noospores and immature oospores provided with 1-6 projections.\nPhylogenetic relationships of the isolates belonging to these new\nspecies with other related species were investigated using internal\ntranscribed spacers of rRNA genes and partial cytochrome c oxidase\nsubunit I sequence data. The phylogenetic analyses separated the two\nspecies from closely related species and placed P. iranense, sp. nov.,\nin clade J1 but the clade of P. monoclinum, sp. nov., was unknown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126262","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_126262.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126263","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126263.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126265","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126265.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126264.phy"}]}
