We sequenced the genomes of an\nadditional 5 taxa from Zoopagales using single cell methods. We\nassembled and binned the genomes using a combination of ESOM, RSCU, and\nGC-coverage blob plots. We inferred a maximum likelihood tree using 192\nproteins and performed an ancestral state reconstruction to determine\nthe ancestral life style of the clade. Our results indicate that\nZoopagales is a monophyletic lineage and that predacious taxa evolved\nfrom mycoparasite ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoopagales ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118944.phy"},{"tree_label":"con","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zoopagales ASTRAL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118945.phy"}]}
