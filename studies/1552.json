According to molecular phylogenetic\nanalysis of the ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2 rDNA regions and morphological\ncharacteristics, LtVB3 was identified as Meliniomyces variabilis, which\nis a recently described species (formerly called “Variable White Taxon”,\nor VWT). In vitro inoculation experiments showed that the fungus can\ncolonize endophytically the roots of torch azalea and eucalyptus. The\nhyphae formed typical structures of ericoid mycorrhizas within root\nepidermal cells of azalea but did not produce any typical\nectomycorrhizal structures with or within root cells of eucalyptus.\nMeliniomyces variabilis are probably diverse in nature but may be\npreferred to colonize roots of plants belonging to ericaceous plant\nfamilies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"dark septate endophytic fungal taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2465.phy"}]}
