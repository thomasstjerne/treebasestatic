We\nredescribed M. caraganae in the new genus Stromatonectria. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of LSU sequences place the genus in the Bionectriaceae,\nHypocreales. S. caraganae occurs on branches of Caragana spp., Colutea\narborescens and Laburnum anagyroides of the Fabaceae. It is\ncharacterized by sphaeroid perithecia partly or entirely immersed in a\nHypocrea-like stroma, a Nectria-like centrum and bicellular hyaline\nascospores. Conidia of S. caraganae are produced in compound pycnidia\nthat are formed prior to or in association with perithecia. Sporodochia\nbut no pycnidia are formed in culture. We discussed genus Myrmaeciella\ncompared S. caraganae with species of the Nectriacea,e including Nectria\nbalansae, N. eustromatica and N. paraguayensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stromatonectria gen. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20847.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stromatonectria gen. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20848.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stromatonectria gen. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stromatonectria gen. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20846.phy"}]}
