We have combined this technique with\nkaryological studies to explore species boundaries in the Western\nMediterranean representatives of Veronica subgen. Pentasepalae. Several\nmembers of this subgenus are represented in the Iberian Peninsula and\nNorth Africa by morphologically similar populations, which lead to\ndifferent taxonomic hypotheses. We have analyzed genetic variation with\ntwo different objectives: first, to provide a basis on which one\ntaxonomic hypothesis is favored against its alternatives, and second, to\nobtain a satisfactory interpretation of phylogeographic patterns. The\nusefulness of several parameters and analyses is considered in order to\nhelp rank taxa and to reveal details of their speciation modes. Some of\nthese parameters are presented with a geographical background to\nfacilitate phylogeographic interpretations. The data support one of the\npreviously proposed taxonomic hypotheses, which results in the\nrecognition of eight taxa. An east-to-west migration route within the\nIberian Peninsula is hypothesized, coinciding with the general pattern\nproposed for Veronica subgen. Pentasepalae. Further data on genetic\nvariability and chromosome counts for 41 populations are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Veronica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1973.phy"}]}
