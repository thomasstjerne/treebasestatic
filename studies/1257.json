Strains were recognized and selected based on\ntheir antifungal activity caused by the triterpene glycoside,\nenfumafungin, or based on morphological characteristics and\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA (ITS) sequence data. Examination of 13 strains from\n8 different sites demonstrated that they share a common set of\nmorphological features. The strains have identical or nearly identical\nsequences of rDNA from ITS regions. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS region\nand intron-containg actin gene sequences demonstrated that these strains\ncomprised a lineage closely allied to, but distinct from, Hormonema\ndematioides, and other dothideaceous ascomycetes with Hormonema\nanamorphs. Therefore, a new species, Hormonema carpetanum, is proposed\nand illustrated. The strains form a pycnidial synanamorph that resembles\nthe coelomycete genus Sclerophoma in agar culture and on sterilized\njuniper leaves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hormonema carpetanum, sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1986.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hormonema carpetanum, sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1985.phy"}]}
