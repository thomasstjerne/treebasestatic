Notostraca, or tadpole shrimps, are an\nancient, globally distributed order of branchiopod crustaceans regarded\nas ‘living fossils’ because their rich fossil record dates back to the\nearly Devonian and their morphology is highly conserved. Recent\nphylogenetic reconstructions have shown a strong biogeographic signal,\nsuggesting diversification due to continental breakup, and widespread\ncryptic speciation. However, morphological conservatism makes it\ndifficult to place fossil taxa in a phylogenetic context. Here we reveal\nfor the first time the timing and tempo of tadpole shrimp\ndiversification by inferring a robust multilocus phylogeny of\nBranchiopoda and applying Bayesian divergence dating techniques using\nreliable fossil calibrations external to Notostraca. Our results suggest\nat least two bouts of global radiation in Notostraca, one of them\nrecent, so questioning the validity of the ‘living fossils’ concept in\ngroups where cryptic speciation is widespread.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maximum clade credibility time tree of Notostraca for\nBEAST analysis","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62128","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62128.phy"}]}
