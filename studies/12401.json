Thelonectria coronata and T. veuillotiana occur\nsympatrically in several geographical areas in tropical, subtropical,\nand temperate regions. Recent studies in fungal systematics have\ndemonstrated that within species significant diversity can be masked by\nphenotypic similarity. Previous taxonomic studies including T. coronata\nand T. veuillotiana suggested these fungi could represent cryptic\nspecies complexes; however, the morphological characters exhibit few\ndifferences useful for resolving species limits. In order to assess the\nstatus of T. coronata and T. veuillotiana, phylogenetic analyses of six\ngenomic regions were combined with a morphological examination of\nspecimens. Based on the multigene phylogeny reconstructed using Maximum\nParsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, five\nphylogenetic groups in T. coronata and six in T. veuillotiana could be\nidentified. As is common for cryptic species, clear and unequivocal\ndiagnostic morphological characters could not be identified; however,\naverage values of morphological traits tend to be different among the\nphylogenetic groups. An increased level of non-synonymous/synonymous\nsubstitutions in ÃŸ-tubulin gene and a decreased or absent production of\nconidia was detected within the T. coronata complex, possibly indicating\nthe homothallic nature of these isolates. Here, T. coronata and T.\nveuillotiana and related species are described and illustrated; a\ndichotomous key to all species is provided","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
