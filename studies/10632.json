Â— It is widely recognized that many genes and\nlineages do not adhere to a molecular clock, yet molecular clocks are\ncommonly used to date divergences in comparative genomic studies. We\ntest the application of a molecular clock across genes and lineages in a\nphylogenetic framework, utilizing 12 genes linked in a 1-Megabase region\non chromosome 13 of soybean (Glycine max), homoeologous copies of these\ngenes formed by polyploidy in Glycine, and orthologous copies in G.\ntomentella, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Medicago truncatula. We compare\ndivergence dates estimated by two methods each in three frameworks: a\nglobal molecular clock with a single rate across genes and lineages\nusing full and approximate likelihood methods based on synonymous\nsubstitutions; a gene-specific clock assuming rate constancy over\nlineages but allowing a different rate for each gene; and a relaxed\nmolecular clock where rates may vary across genes and lineages,\nestimated under penalized likelihood and Bayesian inference. We use the\ncumulative variance across genes as a means of quantifying precision.\nOur results suggest that divergence dating methods produce results that\nare correlated, but that older nodes are more variable and more\ndifficult to estimate with precision and accuracy. We also find that\nmodels incorporating less rate heterogeneity estimate older dates of\ndivergence than more complex models, as node age increases. A mixed\nmodel nested ANOVA testing the effects of framework, method, and gene\nfound that framework had a significant effect on the divergence date\nestimates but that most variation among dates is due to variation among\ngenes, suggesting a need to further characterize and understand the\nevolutionary phenomena underlying rate variation within genomes, among\ngenes, and across lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"r8sgeneF","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9833.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneG","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9834","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9834.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneH","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9835","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9835.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneI","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9836","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9836.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneM","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9838.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneJ","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9837","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9837.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneO","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9839.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneA","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9828","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9828.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8s7genes","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9840.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8s7genes","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9841.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneC","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9830","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9830.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneE","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9832","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9832.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneD","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9831","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9831.phy"},{"tree_label":"r8sgeneB","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9829","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9829.phy"}]}
