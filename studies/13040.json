In contrast to\nmost derived forms from the Upper Cretaceous, the most basal taxa of the\ngroup are poorly known. Thus, studies on these forms are of special\ninterest for understanding the origin and early evolution of\nTitanosauria. Chubutisaurus insignis del Corro, 1975, is known from\npostcranial remains found in the Bayo Overo Member of the Cerro Barcino\nFormation (Chubut Group), which is commonly regarded as AptianCenomanian\nin age. Phylogenetic analyses that include Chubutisaurus recovered this\ntaxon as the sister group to Titanosauria. Nevertheless, most published\nstudies have not in- cluded this taxon, probably due to its brief\ndescription and fragmentary remains. Fieldwork conducted in the quarry\nwhere the holotype was found yielded new materials that are regarded as\npart of the same specimen. These new materials, together with additional\nundescribed, and briefly described elements, originally collected by G.\ndel Corro, are described here. The new information allows the\nrecognition of a more extensive diagnosis of this taxon. The\nphylogenetic analysis presented here resolves Chubutisaurus as the most\nbasal somphospondylian.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 17","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neosauropoda Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55293.phy"}]}
