We show that their most conspicuous functional\nspecializations–a proportionately large skull, incisiform premaxillary\nteeth, expanded jaw-closing musculature, diminutive forelimbs, and\nhindlimbs with cursorial proportions–were present in a new,\nsmall-bodied, basal tyrannosauroid from Lower Cretaceous rocks in\nnortheastern China. These specializations, which were later scaled up in\nLate Cretaceous tyrannosaurids with body masses approaching 100 times\ngreater, drove the most dominant radiation of macropredators of the\nMesozoic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4B","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tyrannosauroidea Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55998.phy"}]}
