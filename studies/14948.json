Ammonium transporters are separated into two\ndistinct families (AMT1 and AMT2), each comprised of five members on\naverage in angiosperms. Nitrate transporters also form two discrete\nfamilies (NRT1 and NRT2), with angiosperms having four NRT2s, on\naverage. In contrast, NRT1s share an evolutionary history with peptide\ntransporters (PTRs). The NRT1/PTR family in land plants usually has more\nthan 50 members and contains also members with distinct activities, such\nas glucosinolate and abscisic acid transport.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGE","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_SGE","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68059.phy"},{"tree_label":"AMT1_IncOut","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AMT1_IncOut","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68048.phy"},{"tree_label":"AMT2","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AMT2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68051.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_IncOut","ntax":"1103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_IncOut","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68052.phy"},{"tree_label":"AMT2_IncOut","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AMT2_IncOut","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68050.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT2","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68055.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT2_IncOut","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT2_IncOut","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68054.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGA","ntax":"179","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_SGA","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68056.phy"},{"tree_label":"NTR1","ntax":"1078","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NTR1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68053.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGFG","ntax":"258","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_SGFG","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68060.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGCD","ntax":"269","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_SGCD","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68058.phy"},{"tree_label":"NTR1_SGHI","ntax":"252","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NTR1_SGHI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68062.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGJ","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NRT1_SGJ","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68063.phy"},{"tree_label":"NRT1_SGB","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NTR1_SGB","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68057.phy"},{"tree_label":"AMT1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AMT1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68049.phy"}]}
