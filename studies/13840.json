While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of\nEarths land surface, more than half the worlds plants and two-thirds of\nterrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical\nSoutheast Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing\nfour biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential\ndrivers of species richness is confounded by the regions dynamic\ngeological and climatic history. Here, we use multi-locus molecular\ngenetic data from dense multi-species sampling of freshwater fishes\nacross three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary\nclimate change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal\ndiversification. While Cenozoic geological processes have clearly shaped\nevolutionary history in Southeast Asian halfbeak fishes, we show that\npaleo-drainage re-arrangements resulting from Quaternary climate change\nplayed a significant role in the spatiotemporal evolution of lowland\naquatic taxa, and provides priorities for conservation efforts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"184","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60644","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60644.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60645","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60645.phy"}]}
