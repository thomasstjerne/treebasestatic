ABC transporters are one of the large\ngroups of transporter proteins found both in plants and in fungi. The\ncrucial role of plant ABC transporters in the formation of the\nmycorrhizal symbiosis has been demonstrated recently. Some of the fungal\nABC transporter-encoding genes are also induced during the mycorrhiza\nformation. However, no experimental evidences of the direct involvement\nof fungal ABC transporters in this process are available so far. To\nfacilitate the identification of fungal ABC proteins with a potential\nrole in the establishment of the mycorrhizal symbiosis, we have\nperformed an inventory of the ABC protein-encoding genes in the genomes\nof 25 species of mycorrhiza-forming fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87000","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87000.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87001","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87001.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87002","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87002.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87003","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87003.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87004","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87004.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87005","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87005.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87006","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87006.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87007","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87007.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87008","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87008.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87009","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87009.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87010","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87010.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87011","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87011.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87012","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87012.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87013","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87013.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87014","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87014.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87015","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87015.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87016.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87017","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87017.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88789.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88790","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88790.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88791.phy"}]}
