Botryosphaeria and\nNeofusicoccum are two well-known genera of the family. In this study 125\nisolates morphologically resembling members of this family were\ncollected from about 20 different fruit and forest trees in Iran. Based\non morphology, MSP-PCR profile and DNA sequence data (ITS and EF1-Î±)\nfour species were identified. Of these, Botryosphaeria dothidea,\nNeofusicoccum mediterraneum and N. parvum are known while Botryosphaeria\nscharifii is described here as a new species. N. mediterraneum is a new\nrecord for Iran and is reported here for the first time on mango trees.\nHigh level of diversity within Iranian population of N. parvum suggest\nthe need to revise and reassess the morphological species description of\nN. parvum and closely related species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPhr TEF","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum MPhr TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53331.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI ITS TEF","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum Bayes ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53332.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI TEF","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum Bayes TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53334.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPhr ITS TEF","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum MPhr ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53329.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPhr ITS","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MPhr ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53330.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI ITS","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum Bayes ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53333.phy"}]}
