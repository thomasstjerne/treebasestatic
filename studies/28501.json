In this study, we seek to understand how mass\nextinction and continental drift have influenced the evolutionary\nhistory of the superorder Osteoglossomorpha, an early lineage of\nfreshwater teleost (bony) fishes. We predict that vicariance resulting\nfrom continental drift will establish deep-node macroevolutionary\nrelationships, but that mass extinction will be followed by a rapid\nincrease in diversification due to a decrease in interspecific\ncompetition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr132061","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132061.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"173","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr132062","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132062.phy"}]}
