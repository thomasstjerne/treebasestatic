Twelve novel species are\ncharacterized based on combined sequence data analyses of internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), beta tubulin (β-tubulin) and translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (EF1α) coupled with morphological characters.\nThe taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of pestalotioid-fungi are\nreappraised with suggestions for future work.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116874.phy"}]}
