In\naddition to strict parsimony, phylogenetic estimates were derived using\nfour different methods that employ stratigraphic data. The resultant\nphylogenies are generally very similar to one another and to the\nphylogeny proposed by Pojeta and Runnegar (1976). All estimates\n(including the Pojeta and Runnegar estimate) imply much lower\nmorphologic separations among post-Ordovician rostroconchs (measured\nhere as the frequency of character state change per branch) than among\nCambro-Ordovician rostroconchs. However, the data do not suggest that\nmorphologic evolution became more constrained among rostroconchs as a\nwhole, but instead suggest a reduced characteristic rate of morphologic\nchange in the clade that happened to survive the end-Ordovician\nextinction. Likelihood ratio tests provide strongest support for the\nhypothesis that morphologic evolution was more constrained within a\nderived subclade (corresponding to previous definitions of the\nConocardioidea, minus the Eopteriidae) than it was in a broad paraphylum\n(corresponding to the Ribeirioidea + Eopteriidae). Estimates from each\nof the phylogenetic methods lead to the same conclusions. Various\nmetrics indicate that the pattern is not due to poor sampling of\nCambro-Ordovician species and thus merits a biological explanation.\nNonphylogenetic analyses of morphologic disparity suggest a similar\nhistory of morphologic evolution, including the apparent difference in\ncharacteristic rates of morphologic evolution between paraclade and\nsubclade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1323.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_543.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conocardiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_544.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conocardiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_621.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_622.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_677.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conocardiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1324.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conocardiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1325.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rostroconchia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1326.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conocardiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1327.phy"}]}
