Separate analyses using ITS, RPB1 and RPB2 DNA\nsequence data are in agreement and show these two species and the type\nspecies, L. pulcherrima form discrete clades within a distinct\nLeuconeurospora clade. The three species are distinguishable\nmorphologically by their anamorphs, having dark conidia in L. capsici,\nhyaline conidia in L. polypaeciloides and no conidia in L. pulcherrima.\nAscomata and ascospores are produced in L. pulcherrima and in mated\nisolates of L. polypaeciloides, but have not been observed in L.\ncapsici. Leuconeurospora species are psychotolerant, with faster growth\nand heavier conidial development at 7 C than at 22 C. Of 151 bats\nsampled from 10 caves, 51 yielded isolates of L. polypaeciloides and 15\nyielded L. capsici. The results were not uniform: neither species was\nisolated from bats in 3 caves, while 3 caves yielded isolates of both\nspecies and 2 yielded L. polypaeciloides only. These species were also\nisolated from cave walls and arthropods in the cave.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RPB1 MPT","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96126","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96126.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB1 bayesian consensus tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96125","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96125.phy"}]}
