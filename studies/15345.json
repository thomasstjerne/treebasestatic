Recent studies of the gamete fusogen\nGCS1/HAP2 indicate that this protein is deeply conserved across\neukaryotes, and its exclusive and/or functional expression generally\nresides in males or in male homologues. However, little is known\nregarding the conserved or primitive molecular traits of males and\nfemales within eukaryotes. Here, using morphologically indistinguishable\nisogametes of the colonial volvocine Gonium pectorale, we demonstrated\nthat GCS1 is differently regulated between the sexes. G. pectorale GCS1\nmolecules in one sex (homologous to âmaleâ) are transported from the\ngamete cytoplasm to the protruded fusion site, whereas those of the\nother sex (âfemalesâ) are quickly degraded within the cytoplasm upon\ngamete activation. This molecular trait difference might be conserved\nacross various eukaryotic lineages and may represent male and female\nprototypes originating from a common eukaryotic ancestor.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gamete fusogen GCS1/HAP2 Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70404.phy"}]}
