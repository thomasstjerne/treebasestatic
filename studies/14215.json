The phylogenetic relationships and generic limits within\nNaucleeae have previously been assessed using combined\nmolecular-morphological data, however the generic status of some genera\nremains questionable. The evolutionary relationships within\nHymenodictyeae have never been investigated before. We performed\nBayesian analyses of the Hymenodictyeae-Naucleeae clade using combined\nnuclear [nrETS; nrITS] data and chloroplast [ndhF; rbcL; rps16; trnT-F]\ndata and a large sampling from both tribes. Our study supports the\nmonophyly of the tribes, all subtribes of Naucleeae (Adininae,\nBreoniinae, Cephalanthinae, Corynantheinae, Mitragyninae, Naucleinae,\nand Uncariinae), and the Hymenodoctyeae genera Hymenodictyon and\nParacorynanthe. Five genera, Adina, Corynanthe, Fleroya, Nauclea, and\nNeonauclea, are non-monophyletic, as Adinauclea, Burttdavya, Haldina,\nLudekia, Metadina, Mitragyna, Myrmeconauclea, Ochreinauclea,\nPausinystalia, Pertusadina, and Sarcocephalus are nested within the\nformer genera. We provisionally maintain the current generic status of\nBreonia and its satellite genera, also Diyaminauclea, and Neonauclea and\nits allied genera, pending further study. In summary, we recognize 17\ngenera: Adina s.l., Breonadia, Breonia, Cephalanthus, Corynanthe s.l.,\nDiyaminauclea, Gyrostipula, Janotia, Khasiaclunea, Ludekia, Mitragyna\ns.l., Myrmeconauclea, Nauclea s.l. Neolamarckia, Neonauclea,\nOchreinauclea, and Uncaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian 50 % Majority Rule consensus of chloroplast\n[ndhF, rbcL, rps16, & trnT-L-F] and nuclear [ETS & ITS]\ndata.","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63481","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63481.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian 95 % Majority Rule consensus of chloroplast\n[ndhF, rbcL, rps16, & trnT-L-F] data","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63483","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63483.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian 95 % Majority Rule consensus of nuclear [ETS\n& ITS] data.","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63484","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63484.phy"},{"tree_label":"Based on a Parsimony bootstrap 50 % Majority Rule\nconsensus tree of chloroplast [ndhF, rbcL, rps16, & trnT-L-F] and\nnuclear [ETS & ITS] data.","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63482","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63482.phy"}]}
