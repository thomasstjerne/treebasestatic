Based on morphological characters\nand molecular analysis, B9 was identified as Umbelopsis isabellina. The\nsupernatant fermented fluid of B9 showed antibacterial activity against\nBacillus cereus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and the metabolite\nextracted from mycelium showed strong activity against all five tested\nstrains, including Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Arthrobacter\nnicotianae, Klebsiella peneumoniae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. For\nantifungal activity, the metabolite extracted from mycelium, not the\nsupernatant fermented fluidï¼shown to be significantly inhibitory to\nfour tested strains (Eurotium rubrum, Alternaria sp., Lasiodiplodia\npseudotheobromae, Diaporthe phaseolorum) except Pestalotiopsis\nmicrospora. This is the first report on the antimicrobial potentials of\nUmbelopsis isabellina strain isolated from marine environment and\nexhibits brilliant future for biological control.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Umbelopsis 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92099.phy"}]}
