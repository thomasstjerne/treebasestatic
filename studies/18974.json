To clarify species boundaries and\ndiversity, we studied the morphology of 74 specimens of Geopyxis from\nthe Northern Hemisphere, including five types, and sequenced four loci\nfor 57 representatives: the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS), D1-D2 domains\nof nuc 28S rDNA (28S), translation elongation factor (tef1), and (or)\npart of the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II (rpb2) (5Â–7\nregion). Eight species are delimited. Six species are shown to be highly\nsupported as reciprocally monophyletic: G. aleurioides sp. nov., G.\nalpina s. l., G. carbonaria, G. delectans, G. korfii, and G. majalis. In\naddition, coalescent-based Bayesian species delimitation shows G. alpina\ns. l. constitutes three cryptic species: G. alpina s. str., G. deceptiva\nsp. nov., and G. rehmii. ITS-28S sequences of type material show that G.\nvulcanalis and G. foetida are synonyms of G. carbonaria. A lectotype is\ndesignated for Humaria delectans and the name is combined in Geopyxis.\nMorphological characters that can be used to distinguish Geopyxis\nspecies are presence/absence of a long stipe, spore size and shape, and\npigmented resinous exudates in medullary and ectal excipulum. Geopyxis\ncarbonaria and G. delectans produce apothecia almost exclusively on\nburned ground. Bayesian analyses detected highly supported conflicts\namong different loci regarding generic delimitation and species\nrelationships. Two hypogeous genera, Stephensia and Hydnocystis, are\nconfirmed to nest within Geopyxis. The relationships between species of\nGeopyxis and Tarzetta, Stephensia shanorii and Paurocotylis pila, are\nunresolved. Six out of eight species of Geopyxis recognized in this\nstudy have intercontinental disjunct distributions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis ef1a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94887.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis ef1a rpb2 LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94890.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis ITS LSU for Run","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94666.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis 20150704 ITS","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94675.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis LSU","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94678.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geopyxis rpb2","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_94681.phy"}]}
