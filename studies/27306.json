Hyphoderma sinense is\ncharacterized by an annual growth habit, resupinate basidiomata with\nsmooth hymenial surface, a monomitic hyphal system with generative\nhyphae bearing clamp connections, IKI, CB, presence of encrusted and\nmoniliform cystidia and cylindrical to allantoid, colorless,\nthin-walled, smooth, basidiospores measuring as 811.5 × 35 µm.\nHyphoderma floccosum is characterized by resupinate basidiomata with\nfarinaceous hymenial surface, a monomitic hyphal system with generative\nhyphae bearing clamp connections, and tubular cystidia and leptocystidia\nand ellipsoid to allantoid, colorless, thin-walled, smooth\nbasidiospores. Sequences of ITS+nLSU nrRNA gene regions of the studied\nsamples were generated and phylogenetic analyses were performed with\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods.\nThese phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of ITS+nLSU\nsequences showed that two new species clustered into Hyphoderma, in\nwhich H. sinense grouped with H. transiens, and H. floccosum grouped\nwith a clade comprising H. pinicola, H. setigerum and H.\nsubsetigerum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"paup","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyphoderma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130900.phy"}]}
