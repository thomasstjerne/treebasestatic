We present a\ncase study using (1) 18S rDNA primary sequences and (2) 18S rDNA\nsequences, and simultaneously their individual secondary structures, to\ninfer the phylogeny of Pseudo-nitzschia and its relatives. Fifty taxa\nclassified in the Bacillariophyceae and Fragilariophyceae were analyzed\nby distance-based (neighbor-joining, NJ) and character-based (maximum\nlikelihood, ML) methods, using different substitution models available\nfor sequence-only and/or sequence-structure data. Four different\nanalyses were performed using NJ to access the influence of different\nsubstitution models in conjunction with the sequence-structure\ninformation on the phylogenetic inferences. Using sequence-only data or\nsequence-structure data yielded different results that are discussed in\nrelation to morphology. Sequence-structure data revealed more robust\nphylogenetic trees that revealed monophyletic clades of morphologically\ndescribed species complexes, the P. seriata and the P.\npseudodelicatissima/delicatissima complexes, with more\nbootstrap-supported branches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"NJ-B tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_84620.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_84761.phy"}]}
