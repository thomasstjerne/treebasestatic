The closest group (group A) to S.\nbambusicola produced distinctive prawn-shaped conidioma-like structures\nthat differed from conidiomata in the anamorph of S. bambusicola.\nCurrently, none of the morphological structures and molecular database\nrecords was compatible with our Shiraia-like fungi. These results reveal\nthat Shiraia-like fungi group A is supposed to be a new species that\nshould be assigned into a novel genus/species related to S.\nbambusicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS tree","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shiraia-like fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3039.phy"},{"tree_label":"betatub","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shiraia-like fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3040.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S tree","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Shiraia-like fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3041.phy"}]}
