The Australian pathogen, previously identified as\nPhoma ligulicola var. inoxydabilis, represents a new species described\nas Stagonosporopsis tanaceti based on morphological characters and a\nfive-gene phylogeny employing partial sequences of the actin,\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha, internal transcribed spacers and\n5.8S of the nrDNA, 28S large subunit and beta-tubulin 2 gene sequences.\nFurthermore, the two varieties of Stagonosporopsis ligulicola are\nelevated to species level as S. chrysanthemi and S. inoxydabilis based\non their DNA phylogeny and morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ray blight pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52323.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ray blight pathogens","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52324.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stagonosporopsis species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52321.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stagonosporopsis species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52322.phy"}]}
