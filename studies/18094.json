Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses of\ncombined SSU, ITS and LSU gene sequence data show that N. didymospora\nbelongs in Didymosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales. The new species is compared\nwith other morphologically and phylogenetically similar species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89788.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89789.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89790","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89790.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89791.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89792","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89792.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89793","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89793.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89794","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89794.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89795","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89795.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89796","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89796.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89797","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89797.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89798","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89798.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89799","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89799.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89800","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89800.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89801","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89801.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89802","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89802.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89803","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89803.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89804.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89805","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89805.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89806","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89806.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89807.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89808","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89808.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89809","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89809.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89810.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89811","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89811.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89812.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89813","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89813.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89814","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89814.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89815.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89816","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89816.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89817","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_89817.phy"}]}
