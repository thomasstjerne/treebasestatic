In a\nrecent paper we described in detail H. subsection Denudata and fifteen\nEuropean species recognized within this subsection. In this paper we\ncontinue this work and describe in detail three additional subsections,\nbuilding upon our work above and complementing the work of D.K. Aanen\nand co-workers. Using refined morphological and molecular methods we\nhave been able to recognize individual taxa within these subsections.\nWithin H. subsection Hiemalia, we recognise just one species, Hebeloma\nhiemale. Here we propose an epitype in order to unambiguously define\nthis taxon. Nine species occurring in Europe are assigned to H. subsect.\nClepsydroida, namely: Hebeloma ammophilum, H. cavipes, H. fragilipes, H.\ningratum, H. laetitiae, H. limbatum, H. matritensis, H. pseudofragilipes\nand H. vaccinum. Of these, we describe three as new, namely H. limbatum,\nH. matritensis and H. pseudofragilipes. Finally, we introduce H.\nsubsection Echinospora with three species: Hebeloma echinosporum, H.\npopulinum and H. rostratum. Although only two of these are described as\nnew, we provide descriptions of all three of these species in order to\nclarify the taxonomy of this section. We provide a key to H. section\nDenudata. We demonstrate that within these subsections there is good\noverall consistency between morphological, phylogenetic and biological\nspecies concepts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 3 V9","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88680","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2C RPB2","ntax":"207","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88681","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2B V6","ntax":"286","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88683","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1B MCM7","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88684","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 5 constrained","ntax":"202","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88685","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2A Tef1a","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88682","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88682.phy"},{"tree_label":"fig1A ITS","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88678","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4 best","ntax":"198","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88679","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88679.phy"}]}
