Stem blight or dieback of\nblueberry plants has been frequently observed in commercial plantations,\nwith incidences between 15 and 30% being observed in China. The causal\nagent of blueberry stem blight and dieback were surveyed at four\ncommercial blueberry plantations in China during 2017 and 2018.\nTwenty-eight isolates of Neofusicoccum were obtained from 75 diseased\nand dead stem samples of blueberry plants. Two novel species, N.\nvaccinii and N. highlandense, were identified based on morphological\ncharacteristics and nucleotide DNA sequence analysis of concatenated\ninternal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor-1α gene and\nβ-tubulin gene sequences. Tests of Kochs postulates indicated that both\nN. vaccinii and N. highlandense were pathogenic toward blueberry plants.\nMycelial growth of Neofusicoccum spp. occurred at temperatures ranging\nfrom 5 to 35 °C, while the optimal temperature for the mycelial growth\nof both N. vaccinii and N. highlandense was 30 °C.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126253.phy"}]}
