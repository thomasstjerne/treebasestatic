These two species are unusual in\nthis genus on account of their brown, one-septate ascospores.\nPhylogenetic analysis based on ITS and EF1-a sequences place them within\nthe clade containing species with Fusicoccum anamorphs. The brown,\none-septate conidia, however, do not conform to Fusicoccum. Therefore,\nphylogenetically and morphologically the anamorphs of these two species\nbelong in a genus distinct from any of the currently accepted anamorph\ngenera assigned to Botryosphaeria. Through a study of the type species\nof Dothiorella this genus is resurrected to accommodate anamorphs of\nBotryosphaeria with brown, one-septate conidia. Botryosphaeria\nsarmentorum is shown to be the teleomorph of Diplodia sarmentorum, which\nin turn is transferred to Dothiorella. Otthia quercus is transferred to\nBotryosphaeria as B. quercicola nom. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1941.phy"}]}
