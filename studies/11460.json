(Glomeromycota) is described\nand illustrated. It forms single spores, which are hyaline through their\nentire life cycle, globose to subglobose, (35‒)63(‒78) µm diam,\nsometimes egg-shaped, 50‒70 × 65‒90 µm, and have an unusually narrow,\n(3.2‒)4.6(‒5.9) µm wide, cylindrical to slightly flared subtending\nhypha. The spore wall of P. majewskii consists of an evanescent,\nshort-lived outermost layer, a laminate middle layer, and a flexible\ninnermost layer, which adheres tightly to the middle layer. None of the\nspore wall layers stain in Melzers reagent. In one-species cultures with\nPlantago lanceolata as the host plant, P. majewskii formed arbuscular\nmycorrhizae staining violet in trypan blue.\nP. majewskii has been isolated from several, distant geographic regions,\nand from different habitats. Its SSU rDNA sequences are highly similar\nto in planta arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal sequences from different\nhabitats in Spain and Ecuador.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr43900","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_43900.phy"}]}
