We sampled this\ngroup worldwide to address questions about subclade relationships, the\norigin of C4 photosynthesis, the evolution of weeds, and the role of\nhybridization and long-distance dispersal in the diversification of the\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS ML tree","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26135","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26135.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS_Bayes_majority rule","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26133","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26133.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA bayes consensus","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26136","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26136.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA ML tree","ntax":"154","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26137","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26137.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMB2765 Bayes tree","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26140","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26140.phy"},{"tree_label":"EMB2765 Garli tree","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr26141","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26141.phy"}]}
