The draft genome\nsequence of E. mundtii was recently announced. Its genome encodes at\nleast 2,589 genes and 57 RNAs, and 4 putative genomic islands have been\ndetected. The objective of this study was to compare the genetic content\nof E. mundtii with respect to other enterococcal species and, more\nspecifically, to identify genes coding for putative virulence traits\npresent in enterococcal opportunistic pathogens. Results: An in-depth\nmining of the annotated genome was performed in order to uncover the\nunique properties of this microorganism, which allowed us to detect a\ngene encoding the antimicrobial peptide mundticin among other relevant\nfeatures. Moreover, in this study a comparative genomic analysis against\ncommensal and pathogenic enterococcal species, for which genomic\nsequences have been released, was conducted for the first time.\nFurthermore, our study reveals significant similarities in gene content\nbetween this environmental isolate and the selected enterococci strains\n(sharing an âenterococcal gene coreâ of 805 CDS), which contributes to\nunderstand the persistence of this genus in different niches and also\nimproves our knowledge about the genetics of this diverse group of\nmicroorganisms that includes environmental, commensal and opportunistic\npathogens. Conclusion: although E. mundtii CRL1656 is phylogenetically\ncloser to E. faecium, frequently responsible of nosocomial infections,\nthis strain does not encode the most relevant relevant virulence factors\nfound in the enterococcal clinical isolates and bioinformatic\npredictions indicate that it possesses the lowest number of putative\npathogenic genes amonf the most representative enterococcal species.\nAccordingly, infection assays using the Galleria mellonella model\nconfirmed its low virulence.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of E. mundtii CRL1656","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75193.phy"}]}
