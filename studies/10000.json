The present study focuses on diploid speciation in a\npoorly explored ancestral group of the genus Cardamine that is\ndistributed in the amphi-Adriatic territory. Morphological data and DNA\nsequences (plastid trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer, ITS of nrDNA, and\nsingle-copy nuclear gene CHS) were used to address taxonomic,\nphylogenetic and evolutionary questions. Recognition of several\npreviously described, but recently not accepted narrow endemics is\nsupported (C. fialae, C. rupestris, C. serbica). C. maritima s.str. is\nsegregated into three distinct entities, giving them a species rank. A\nnew taxonomic concept of the group is proposed, including detailed\nchorological survey, identification key and nomenclatural accounts with\nsynonymy, typifications, description of the new species C. montenegrina,\nand publication of C. adriatica, nomen novum. Chloroplast data indicate\ninitial radiation of the ancestral lineage into a series of distinct\nendemic species; the lack of resolution at internal nodes and\nincongruence with nuclear phylogenies suggest that this occurred\nrapidly. Nuclear data, in turn, partly show geographic structuring\nwithin the core of the studied group, indicating more recent\nhybridization events. It is assumed that glacial-induced local-scale and\naltitudinal migrations along the Balkan coastline and in adjacent\nmassifs caused contacts between previously isolated populations,\nresulting in occasional interspecific gene-flow. Trans-Adriatic contacts\nand gene exchange are suggested as well.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 rep2","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 rep1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6362.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 rep2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6363.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 con 50 majrule","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6320.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 con 50 majrule","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6042.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 rep1","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6578.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 rep2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6241.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 con 50 majrule","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6310.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 rep1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cardamine maritima","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6240.phy"}]}
