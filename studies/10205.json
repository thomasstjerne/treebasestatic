This species was characterized based\non its morphology, nuclear rDNA and partial ?-tubulin gene sequences.\nThe fungus grew optimally at 25 Â°C on 2% malt extract agar and showed a\nhigh level of tolerance to cycloheximide. The Leptographium sp. has\nlong, grouped conidiophores and is morphologically most similar to L.\nabietinum while is genetically close to O. abiocarpum. Comparison of DNA\nsequence data as well as morphological and physiological\ncharacteristics, confirmed that this fungus represents a new species\ndescribed here as L. fruticetum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spruce-Colonizing Leptographium Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6004.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13L","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptographium Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6601.phy"}]}
