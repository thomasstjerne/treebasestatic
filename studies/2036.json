Despite the obvious impact these lice have\nhad on their human hosts, it is unclear whether head and body lice\nrepresent two morphological forms of a single species or two distinct\nspecies. To assess the taxonomic status of head and body lice, we\nprovide a synthesis of publicly available molecular data in Genbank, and\nwe compare phylogenetic and population genetic methods using the most\ndiverse geographic and molecular sampling presently available. Our\nanalyses find reticulated networks, gene flow, and a lack of reciprocal\nmonophyly, all of which indicate that head and body lice do not\nrepresent genetically distinct evolutionary units. Based on these\nfindings, as well as inconsistencies of morphological, behavioral, and\necological variability between head and body lice, we contend that no\nknown species concept would recognize these louse morphotypes as\nseparate species. We recommend recognizing head and body lice as\nmorphotypes of a single species, P. humanus, until compelling new data\nand analyses (preferably analyses of fast evolving nuclear markers in a\ncoalescent framework) indicate otherwise.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3030.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"170","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3028.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3029.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3031.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3032.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4c","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5133.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5134.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5141.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5c","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Human head lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5142.phy"}]}
