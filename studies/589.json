Phylogenies based on\nmolecular data and those based on morphological data both place\ncetaceans among ungulates but are incongruent in other respects.\nMorphologists argue that cetaceans are most closely related to\nmesonychians, an extinct group of terrestrial ungulates. They have\ndisagreed, however, as to whether Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) or\nArtiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) is the extant clade most closely\nrelated to Cetacea, and have long maintained that each of these orders\nis monophyletic. The great majority of molecule-based phylogenies show,\nby contrast, not only that artiodactyls are the closest extant relatives\nof Cetacea, but also, that Artiodactyla is paraphyletic unless cetaceans\nare nested within it, often as the sister group of hippopotamids. We\ntested morphological evidence for several hypotheses concerning the\nsister taxon relationships of Cetacea in a maximum parsimony analysis of\n123 morphological characters from 10 extant and 30 extinct taxa. We\nadvocate treating certain multistate characters as ordered because such\na procedure incorporates information about hierarchical morphological\ntransformation. In all most-parsimonious trees, whether multistate\ncharacters are ordered or unordered, Artiodactyla is the extant sister\ntaxon of Cetacea. With certain multistate characters ordered, the\nextinct clade Mesonychia (Mesonychidae + Hapalodectidae) is the sister\ntaxon of Cetacea, and Artiodactyla is monophyletic. When all fossils are\nremoved from the analysis, Artiodactyla is paraphyletic with Cetacea\nnested inside, indicating that inclusion of mesonychians and other\nextinct stem taxa in a phylogenetic analysis of the ungulate clade is\nintegral to the recovery of artiodactyl monophyly. Phylogenies derived\nfrom molecular data alone may risk recovering inconsistent branches\nbecause of an inability to sample extinct clades, which by a\nconservative estimate amounts to 89% of the ingroup. Addition of data\nfrom recently described cetacean astragali attributed to cetaceans does\nnot overturn artiodactyl monophyly.
