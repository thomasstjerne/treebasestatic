On the\nbasis of perianth morphology, current taxonomic treatments recognize two\nsections that do not correspond to geographic distributions. A recent\nphylogenetic study using ITS sequences found strong support for separate\nOld and New World clades, but did not include all New World species. We\nelaborate on this previous study by including all known New World\nspecies of Illicium, as well as three additional Asian species, using\nITS and the plastid loci trnL, the trnL-F spacer, and trnG. We estimated\ndivergence times within Illicium, using penalized likelihood and\nmultiple fossil calibration points. Our results support separate New and\nOld World clades, and we re-circumscribe current sectional groupings\nbased on these data. The Illicium crown group appears to have arisen\nduring the Cretaceous, with New World extant taxa diversifying as\nrecently as the late Miocene or early Pliocene. These dates are\nconsistent with recent fossil evidence and molecular estimates for\nminimum ages of the angiosperms, and for timing of diversification\nevents in other ancient groups, such as Nymphaeales and\nChloranthaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Illiciaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_985.phy"}]}
