They are\ndistinguished by the association with the endemic cCow-tail fFir that\nknown only froofm Taiwan, small light brown ascocarp with dark brown\ngleba , with 1 to 4-spored asci and, ascospores mostly dark brown and\nellipsoid ascospore with alveolate reticulum in a dark brown gleba. They\nresembled several Asian white truffles species like Tuber thailandicum\nSuwannarach, Kumla & Lumyong, Tuber T. panzhihuanense Deng &\nWang, Tuber T. latisporum Chen & Liu and Tuber T. sinopuberulum Fan\n& Cao in Asia, however detailed morphological and phylogenetic\nanalysis have revealed them as a new species and we describe here as\nTuber xitouense, as the first white truffle species in Taiwan.. It is an\nimportant discovery in Taiwan and advance the understanding in the\ndistribution and polygenticpolygenetic relationship in Tuber that are\nespecially scarce in Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tuber xitouense","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109017.phy"}]}
