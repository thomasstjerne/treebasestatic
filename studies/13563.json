Colour\npictures, macro and micro morphological data and scanning electron\nmicroscopy of the spores are provided. Molecular analyses based on\nsequencing the ITS rRNA regions and rpb2 protein-coding gene suggested a\nstrong molecular divergence of C. magenteiannulatus with its closest\nknown relatives and supported the monophyly of the new species within\nCortinarius. Cortinarius veronicae and C. veronicoides were found as the\ntwo closest relatives to C. magenteiannulatus. Surprisingly, these three\nspecies were recovered within a strongly supported monophyletic clade\nthat includes northern hemisphere species belonging to section\nVeneti.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"211","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58228.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"211","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58229.phy"}]}
