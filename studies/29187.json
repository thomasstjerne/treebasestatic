A field\nsurvey was conducted in the mayor blueberry production area, comprising\nlatitudes 32°49’S to 40°55’S, to determine the occurrence and\ndistribution of Botryosphaeriaceae species in Chile. A combined\nmultilocus analysis, morphological characterization and\nphytopathogenicity testing was used to identify 51 Neofusicoccum\nisolates belonging to N. nonquaesitum (28 strains), N. parvum (22\nstrains), and N. australe (1 strain). Of these, N. parvum and N.\nnonquaesitum were the most commonly found, being N. parvum most frequent\nfrom latitude 37° 40’S to the north, while N. nonquaesitum was\npredominantly located from the same latitude towards the south.\nMorphological traits of the isolates were consistent with the species\nidentified molecularly, despite of the overlapping of conidial size of\nsome isolates between species. Pathogenicity trials showed that the\nthree species were pathogenic to blueberry plants and revealed that N.\nparvum and N. nonquaesitum were the most aggressive species, although\nvariability in virulence responses were observed within the N. parvum\nand N. nonquaesitum isolates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135009.phy"}]}
