These characters\nare typical of Triplophyllum and suggest that T. brauniana might belong\nto that genus instead of Tectaria. To determine the phylogenetic\nrelationships of T. brauniana, we used sequence evidence from four\nchloroplast DNA markers (rbcL, rps4-trnS, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF) to\ngenerate a phylogenetic hypothesis for the Tectariaceae. The analysis\nincluded the tectarioid genera Arthropteris, Hypoderris, Psammiosorus,\nPteridrys, Tectaria, and Triplophyllum. Tectaria brauniana was recovered\nsister to a clade formed by Hypoderris brownii and Tectaria\nnicotianifolia, and these three species were sister to Triplophyllum.\nThese two clades were in turn sister to the rest of Tectaria. Thus, to\npreserve the monophylly of Tectaria, T. brauniana and T. nicotianifolia\nshould be classified in Hypoderris, a genus previously considered\nmonotypic. Accordingly, we make the following new combinations:\nHypoderris brauniana and H. nicotianifolia. In this expanded sense,\ncreeping rhizomes, two-ranked leaves, and spiny perispores characterize\nHypoderris morphologically. Hypoderris, with its three species, occurs\nin the Caribbean region, Central America, and the Andes from northern\nVenezuela to Bolivia","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tectaria brauniana and the recognition of\nHypoderris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_65464.phy"}]}
