{"Authors":" Seiji Hayashi","Year":" 2005","Title":" The Molecular Phylogeny of the Buccinidae (Caenogastropoda:\nNeogastropoda) as Inferred from the Complete Mitochondrial 16S rRNA Gene\nSequences of Selected Representatives","Journal":" Molluscan Research","Volume":" 25","Issue":" NA","Pages":" NA","Keywords":"","DOI":" NA","Abstract":" Complete mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene sequences from 35\ncaenogastropods were obtained to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship\nof the family Buccinidae at the intra-supra familial level. With respect\nto intergeneric relationships within the family, the molecular phylogeny\nsupported three clades with statistical significance: Buccinum +\nNeptunea, Engina + Pisania + Pollia and Penion + Kelletia. These\ngroupings are generally consistent with the morphological and\npaleontological evidence. In particular, it is noteworthy that the\nmonophyly of Penion and Kelletia was established. Their close\nrelationship as antitropical genera is confirmed for the first time.\nBabylonia was positioned remotely from the other buccinids confirming\nrecent morphological and molecular work. The monophyly of the current\nconcept of Buccinidae was violated by intercalations of nassariids and\nfasciolariids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buccinidae, WMP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4528.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buccinidae, NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4526.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buccinidae, UMP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4527.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Buccinidae, ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4529.phy"}]}
