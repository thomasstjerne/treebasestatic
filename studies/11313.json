We describe Alogomyces tanneri as the first lobulomycetalean\nchytrid isolated from horse manure; A. tanneri is also the first species\nin the order to possess a rumposome in its zoospore. This species widens\nthe range of habitats, ultrastructural variation, and thallus morphology\nfor Lobulomycetales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alogomyces tanneri","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31333.phy"}]}
