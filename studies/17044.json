Antrodia subserpens sp.\nnov. is described and illustrated. Both the morphology and phylogenetic\nanalysis support this new species. Morphologically, it is characterized\nby annual, resupinate to effused-reflexed basidiocarps, a dimitic hyphal\nsystem with clamped generative hyphae, clavate cystidioles, and\nellipsoid to oblong ellipsoid basidiospores; moreover, it causes a brown\nrot. Molecular data suggested a close relationship between A. subserpens\nand A. serpens, but the former has slightly smaller pores and shorter\nbasidiospores. Morphologically, A. subserpens is similar to A. tanakae,\nbut separates by its smaller pores and wider basidiospores. An\nidentification key to species of the A. heteromorpha complex is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia ITS+LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107810.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia ITS+Tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107809.phy"}]}
