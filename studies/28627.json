The new species are lookalikes, morphologically\nonly separable by their spore morphology. Descriptions and illustrations\nof the new genus and new species are given, as well as comments on\necology, distribution and morphological differences with other gilled\nBoletaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paxilloboletus ITS LSU rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135012.phy"},{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"321","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paxilloboletus LSU rpb1 rpb2 tef1-a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135013.phy"}]}
