Most\ndiversity is centred in the Indo-Pacific, but several genera are present\nin multiple ocean basins, or across regions separated by biogeographic\nbarriers. The monophyly of these widespread genera had not been tested\npreviously. We used 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA, and COI sequence data to\ngenerate a molecular phylogeny for this group. We recovered evidence of\nparaphyly or polyphyly in all of the widespread genera examined\n(Hypselodoris, Mexichromis, Chromodoris, Glossodoris). East Atlantic\nHypselodoris and west Atlantic + east Pacific Mexichromis species were\nmore closely related to each other than they were to their Indo-Pacific\ncongeners. The addition of Southern Ocean species of Digidentis\ndemonstrated an interesting alternative to this relationship, becoming\nthe sister group for the east Atlantic Hypselodoris on the basis of 16S\nand 18S data, but not COI data. Sister group relationships were\nrecovered for most monotypic or enigmatic genera. Ardeadoris is linked\nto Glossodoris, as is Diversidoris; Pectenodoris is sister to the\nIndo-Pacific Mexichromis clade, and Verconia is the sister to Noumea\nhaliclona. Controversy surrounding the placement of the three most basal\ngenera was only partially resolved. Using Actinocyclus to root the\nmitochondrial trees, Cadlinella was the unsupported sister to the\nChromodorididae (excluding Cadlina), and Tyrinna occupied a relatively\nbasal position, although this also did not receive significant\nstatistical support. Adding nuclear 18S data gave support for Cadlina as\nthe sister group to the rest of the Chromodorididae s. s.. Otherwise,\nlike previous molecular studies, mitochondrial genes supported an\nalternative position for Cadlina (with other dorid genera).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S+COI+18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_355.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes MJ","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2920.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae COI, positions 1 and 2 only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes MJ","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae COI, positions 1 and 2 only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2922.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S+COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S+COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4980.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S+COI+18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4981.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4982.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP strict","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chromodorididae 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4983.phy"}]}
