They\nseemed to belong to one morphospecies. However, sequences of the small\nsubunit rDNA and internal transcribed spacers, including the 5.8S rDNA,\nrevealed that six represent different species of the genus\nAllovahlkampfia while one belongs to an unknown genus of which the\nclosest relative is the genus Fumarolamoeba. Some unnamed strains of\nwhich the sequences had been published before are also given species\nstatus within the genus Allovahlkampfia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Allovahlkampfia ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69255.phy"}]}
