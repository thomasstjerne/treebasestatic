In recent studies the presence of six species\nin Europe was confirmed, namely Tricholomopsis rutilans, T. decora, T.\nflammula, T. sulphureoides, T. pteridicola and T. badinensis. T.\nrutilans and T. decora are characterized as common species in Europe,\nwhereas T. flammula and T. sulphureoides are considered rare with\nlimited references.This study reports the presence of T. flammula and T.\nsulphureoides in Greece, providing new data on the morphology,\nphylogeny, distribution and rarity of these species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129308","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129308.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129309","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129309.phy"}]}
