As a\nresult of EGT, a set of genes was transferred to the nucleus of the\nhost. Many genes of Calvin cycle enzymes are considered EGT-derived, and\nphosphoribulokinase gene (PRK) may be ideal to trace historical events\nof plastid EGT due to its conservative sequences and few evolutionary\nreplacement from mitochondrial homologues. Although the previous\nphylogenetic research on PRK genes demonstrated a chromalveolate- or\nred-derived PRK gene from Euglenophyta or Chlorarachniophyta,\nrespectively, only a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) (Euglena\nand Bigelowiella) was analyzed in each of these two secondary “green”\nphotosynthetic eukaryotic groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PRK1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PRK1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47810.phy"},{"tree_label":"SBP1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SBP1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_47812.phy"}]}
