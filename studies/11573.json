Light\nmicroscopic and environmental scanning electron microscopic observations\nconfirm the details of the unusual meristem arthric conidium ontogeny\npresented in the protologue. For phylogenetic analysis, a data set of\n122 species representing nine classes of euascomycetes was assembled\nincluding sequences from nuclear small and large subunits and\nmitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA and the largest and second\nlargest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1, RPB2). A five gene\nphylogeny suggests that the fungus is phylogenetically related to the\nEurotiomycetes. It sits alone on a long branch as a sister to the\nMycocaliciales of the Mycocaliciomycetidae. Cirrosporium exhibits\nseveral morphological characters similar to those of members of the\nMycocaliciales; however, the paucity of known anamorphs in this order\ndoes not offer any further clarification on possible relationships. It\nis clear that the rare and broadly distributed meristem arthric\nontogenetic pattern is polyphyletic, occurring in widely separately\ngroups of anamorphs of both the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Eurotiomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50780.phy"}]}
