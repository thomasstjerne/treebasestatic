It is characterized by the\nbrightly colored multi-storied basidiocarps, non-amyloid and\nthick-walled ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores, distribution in\nsubtropical to tropical regions. In this study, P. ailaoshanensis is\ndescribed and illustrated as a new species based on morphological and\nmolecular evidence. This species is characterized by its multi-storied\nbasidiocarps, zonate and fuzzy pileus, light ivory to yellow orange\npileal surface, hollow main axis and globose to subglobose basidiospores\n(4.15 × 3.94.8 μm). Phylogenetically, on the basis of combined dataset\nof ITS, nLSU, EF1-α and nSSU, P. ailaoshanensis is strongly supported as\na new species of Podoserpula.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Podoserpula ailaoshanensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95220.phy"}]}
