Dorsal scute ‘wings’ are expanded and subrectangular in\nEllimma and other members of the family Paraclupeidae Chang and Chou\n(1977), approximately equal to Ellimmichthyidae Grande (1982a).\nConsequently, Ellimma branneri is classified here within the family\nParaclupeidae. Paraclupeidae are known from the Lower Cretaceous to the\nmiddle Eocene. In the present work, two monophyletic groups are\nidentified within the Paraclupeidae. One group (subfamily Paraclupeinae\nof Chang and Grande, 1997), known only from the Lower Cretaceous\n(HauterivianAlbian), includes Paraclupea,Ellimmichthys, and Ellimma.\nThese taxa are united by strongly sculptured, skull-roofing bones with\nridges radiating from the growth center, and a dorsal scute ornament of\nprominent ridges. Scutatuspinosus may also belong in this group. The\nother group includes Diplomystus (Upper CretaceousEocene) and Armigatus\n(Upper Cretaceous), which are united by a single homoplaseous character\n(pres- ence of a posteriorly expanded third hypural, leaving no gap\nbetween hypurals 2 and 4): this character also occurs in\npristigasteroids, Erichalcis, osteoglossids, some elopomorphs\n(Lebanichthys lewisi, and most Albula spp.), and a number of\nostariophysans not included in our analysis. Paraclupeines are\ncustomarily regarded as being more closely related to the Clupeiformes\nthan to other teleosts (i.e., as clupeomorphs), although no derived\ncharacters are uniquely shared by Ellimma branneri and modern\nClupeiformes. The relationships of Ellimma and certain other extinct\nherring-like teleosts (including other paraclupeines) with the\nClupeiformes are unclear, and they may collectively form a paraphyletic\nassemblage. No biogeographical hypothesis satisfactorily explains the\nknown distribution of nonmarine paraclupeine fishes in the Cretaceous. A\nsubstantial portion of their nonmarine fossil record is missing (as\nevidenced by the recent discovery of a possible paraclupeine,\nEzkutuberezi carmeni Poyato-Ariza et al., 2000, in Spain), and some\naspects of their early distribution pattern may have involved marine\ndispersal. Eocene Diplomystus occurs on both sides of the Pacific Ocean,\nbut the ‘Pacifica’ hypothesis (which lacks empirical support) is\nabandoned as an explanation for such Eocene (and younger) trans-Pacific\ndistribution patterns of nonmarine fishes. Instead, a ‘freshwater Arctic\nOcean’ hypothesis is favored. According to this hypothesis (for which\nthere are several independent lines of geological evidence), temporary\ndesalination of the Arctic Ocean occurred during the Paleocene and early\nEocene, which may have permitted freshwater fishes to move unimpeded by\nsalt-water barriers between Asia and North America; this temporary\ndesalination event may eventually become recognized as a significant\nfactor in the holarctic distribution patterns of various Tertiary-Recent\nfreshwater fishes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 13B+","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ellimma branneri and Diplomystus shengliensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53735.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13A+","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ellimma branneri and Diplomystus shengliensis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53734.phy"}]}
