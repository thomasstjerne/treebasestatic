We investigate the\nsaline resistance of P. thunbergii root endophytes in relation to site\n(Goseong, Uljin, Busan) and location (inland, shoreline) using culturing\nand molecular methods. Endophytic fungi were isolated from root tips of\nP. thunbergii and growth rates of pure cultured isolates were measured\nand compared between PDA with and without 3% NaCl to confirm their\nsaline resistance. A total of 259 endophytic fungi were isolated and\norganized into 136 morphotypes. DNA sequencing of the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) identified 58 species among the morphotypes.\nRepresentatives of three fungal phyla were present: 44 Ascomycota, 8\nZygomycota, and 6 Basidiomycota. Penicillium spp. and Trichoderma spp.\nwere the dominant endophytic fungi, and many grew well in saline media.\nWe find five endophyte species common to all sites, with three being\nsaline resistant. No statistical difference in endophyte communities\nbetween sites or location was found. However, more saline resistant\nspecies associated with Busan and with shoreline environments. Analyzing\nsoil properties, Busan had higher salt and nitrogen levels that were\nstatistically significant. These soil differences may influence the\nnumber of saline resistant endophytes present at a site. This\ninvestigation indicates that many endophytic fungi of P. thunbergii\npossess the ability to proliferate in saline soil and potentially play a\nrole in growth and regeneration of coastal P. thunbergii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"140","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66034","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66034.phy"}]}
