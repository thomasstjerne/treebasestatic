Nuclear sequences from nrDNA ITS, LEAFY, and\nGBSSI (two copies), along with morphological characters, recognize two\nclades (series Crataegifolia and Micrantha). However, chloroplast\nphylogenies based on ndhF, trnL-F, and psbA-trnH are significantly\nincongruent with the nuclear trees and show two major clades with\nspecies from Asian continent minus the northeast (AS-N) in one clade and\nthose from Asian Pacific Islands plus the northeast Asia (PINAS) in the\nother. Ancient hybridization and chloroplast capture may have occurred\nacross the species boundaries of the two series in both geographic\nareas. The two series diverged at 46.3 mya, which is before the\nformation of the Japanese Sea in the early Miocene (32-18 mya). The\nJapanese Sea may be the barrier for the seed exchange between the two\ngeographic areas, and was responsible for the formation of the disjunct\ndistribution of section Macrantha between the AS-N and PINAS areas, and\nbetween eastern Asia and North America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrantha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6104.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrantha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6217.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrantha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrantha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6694.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrantha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6620.phy"}]}
