This new species is characterized by 3 resupinate basidiocarps,\nporoid hymenophore, pseudodimitic hyphal system, nodose-4 septate\nhyphae, four kinds of cystidia (capitate, acicular or cylindrical,\nsubulate to 5 ventrose cystidia, and apically-encrusted), and\nthin-walled, colorless, smooth and 6 ellipsoid basidiospores. Both\nMaximum Parsimony and Bayesian algorisms were used to 7 constructed\nphylogenies inferred from internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of\nrDNA. 8 Morphological and molecular studies, along with\nintercompatibility test confirmed the 9 independent status of this\nspecies. A global key to known species of Hyphodontia s.l. 10 with\nporoid, irpicoid or raduloid hymenophore were provided for further\nconvenience in 11 identification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105980","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105980.phy"}]}
