It is typified by P.\nbubalina sp. nov., and the new species is characterized by an annual\ngrowth habit, resupinate basidiocarps, a monomitic hyphal system with\nsimple septa, dextrinoid and thick-walled generative hyphae, presence of\nabundant thin-walled dendrohyphidia in the subiculum, and small, smooth,\nellipsoid basidiospores. Phylogenetic analysis of P. bubalina and its\nrelated species was inferred from ITS and nLSU rDNA sequences, which\nindicates that it belongs to the Meruliaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79667.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79666.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79665.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79664.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79663.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79662.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79661.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79660.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phlebiporia bubalina gen. et. sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79668.phy"}]}
