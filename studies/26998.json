Location: focus on Antarctica, in\ncomparison to data from all over the world. Taxon: Rotifera Bdelloidea.\nMethods: We analysed different metrics of genetic diversity, also\nspatially explicit ones, including number of haplotypes, accumulation\ncurves, genetic distances, time to the most recent common ancestor,\nnumber of independently evolving units from DNA taxonomy, strength of\nthe correlation between geographic and genetic distances, population\ngenetics neutrality and differentiation indices, potential historical\nprocesses, obtained from an extensive sample of cytochrome oxidase\nsubunit I (COI). We analysed 2244 individuals from 23 species in a\ncomparison between Antarctic and non-Antarctic species, subdivided into\na dataset of nine well-sampled species to provide reliable inference,\nand a secondary dataset of 14 less well-sampled species to support the\ngenerality of the results obtained from the main dataset. Results:\nAntarctic species had consistently lower genetic diversity and younger\nage than non-Antarctic species, even if they were similar in sample\nsize, geographical extent, neutrality and differentiation indices, and\ncorrelation between genetic and geographic distances. Main conclusions:\nThe extensive survey of genetic diversity in one mitochondrial marker in\nAntarctic bdelloids support the previous suggestions from other\norganisms that the origin of terrestrial Antarctic fauna occurred\nthrough extinctions and not new adaptations, that the harsh conditions\nhave maintained a reduced genetic diversity, and that also in Antarctica\nbiogeographical barriers may have an effect on structuring genetic\ndiversity in space.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126337","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126337.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126338","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126338.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126339.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126340.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126341","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126341.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126344","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126344.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126322.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"300","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126323.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126326","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126326.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126327.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126333","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126333.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126335","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126324","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126324.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126325","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126325.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126329","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126329.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126334.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126336.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126328.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126330.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126331","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126331.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126332","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126332.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126342","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126342.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126343","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126343.phy"}]}
