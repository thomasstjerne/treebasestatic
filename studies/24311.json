Yet, their taxonomy\nstill consists of a single order - Caudovirales, composed of just four\nfamilies: Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and the newly described\nAckermannviridae family. In recent years this morphology-based\nclassification scheme has started to crumble, undermined by the constant\nflood of phage sequences, revealing that tailed phages are even more\ngenetically diverse than once thought. This prompted us (the Bacterial\nand Archaeal Viruses Subcommittee of the International Committee on\nTaxonomy of Viruses, ICTV) to consider overall reorganization of phage\ntaxonomy. In this study, we used a wide range of complementary methods \nincluding comparative genomes, core genome analysis and marker gene\nphylogenetics  to show that the group of Bacillus phage SPO1-related\nviruses previously classified into the Spounavirinae subfamily is\nclearly distinct and its diversity deserves the rank of an autonomous\nfamily. Thus, we propose to remove them from the Myoviridae family and\ncreate “Herelleviridae”  a new taxon with the same rank. In the process\nof the taxon evaluation we explored the feasibility of different\ndemarcation criteria and critically evaluated the usefulness of our\nmethods for phage classification. The convergence of results, drawing a\nconsistent and comprehensive picture of a new family with associated\nsubfamilies, regardless of method demonstrates that the tools applied\nhere are particularly useful in phage taxonomy. We are convinced that\ncreation of this novel family is a crucial milestone towards much-needed\nre-classification in the Caudovirales order.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Herelleviridae IQtree concatenated markers tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117248.phy"},{"tree_label":"6117 00043 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117249.phy"},{"tree_label":"6121 00047 ATP dependent helicase 41 tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117250.phy"},{"tree_label":"6132 00058 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117251.phy"},{"tree_label":"6133 00059 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117252","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117252.phy"},{"tree_label":"6147 00073 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117256","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117256.phy"},{"tree_label":"6141 00067 Virion protein 5 tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117253","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117253.phy"},{"tree_label":"6148 00074 Putative major capsid protein precursor tree\n1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117257","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117257.phy"},{"tree_label":"6142 00068 Putative tail sheath protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117255","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117255.phy"},{"tree_label":"6150 00076 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117258","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117258.phy"},{"tree_label":"6151 00077 hypothetical protein tree 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117259.phy"}]}
