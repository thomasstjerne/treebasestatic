The following taxonomic changes in Artocarpus subgenus\nPseudojaca Trécul, based on recent phylogenetic work, are presented with\ndiagnostic characters. Artocarpus griffithii (King) Merr. is reinstated\nas distinct from A. lamellosus Blanco (which is called A. nitidus Trécul\nin the earlier literature), also requiring the reinstatement of the\nfollowing taxa not found in Singapore: A. borneensis (Merr.)\nF.M.Jarrett, A. humilis Becc., A. vrieseanus Miq. var. subsessilis\nF.M.Jarrett and A. xanthocarpus Merr. Artocarpus dadah Miq. is\nreinstated as distinct from A. lacucha Roxb. ex Buch.-Ham., thereby\nnecessitating the reinstatement of the following taxa not found in\nSingapore: A. fretessii Teijsm. & Binn. ex Hassk., A. ovatus Blanco,\nand A. vrieseanus var. refractus (Becc.) F.M.Jarrett. Artocarpus\ngomezianus Wall. ex Trécul is restricted to the type subspecies, and A.\nzeylanicus (F.M.Jarrett) E.M.Gardner & Zerega, formerly a\nsubspecies, is elevated to species level. Thirteen lectotypes and two\nneotypes are designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML supermatrix","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125455.phy"},{"tree_label":"ASTRAL speciesTree","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125456","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125456.phy"}]}
