Morphological characters were studied and\nwith support from phylogenetic analyses of combined ITS, LSU, SSU and\nTEF1-Î± sequence data we introduce two new species Neodeightonia\nrattanica, and N rattanicola The new species are introduced with\ndescriptions and illustrations and compared with other Neodeightonia\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodeightonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97622.phy"}]}
