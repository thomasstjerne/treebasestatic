Many names have not\nbeen used consistently and in some instances the same species has been\ndescribed two or more times under separate names. This study focuses on\nsubgenus Phlegmacium as traditionally defined and includes species from\nboreal and temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Our goals for\nthis project were to i) study type materials to determine which species\nhad already been described, ii) stabilize the use of Friesian and other\nolder names by choosing a neo- or epitype, iii) describe new species\nthat were discovered during the process of studying specimens, and iv)\nestablish an accurate ITS barcoding database for Phlegmacium species. A\ntotal of 238 types representing 156 species were studied. Of the names\nonly 61 were currently represented in GenBank. Twenty-five new species\nare described and six new combinations made. Neotypes are proposed for\n21 species, and epitypes are designated for three species. As a\nconsequence an ITS barcoding database of 180 species is released.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"461","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67439","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67439.phy"}]}
