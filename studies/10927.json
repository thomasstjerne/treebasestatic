Here we\ndescribe a new member of the section Merrillosphaera originating from\nTexas (USA): V. ovalis M.A.Â Pocock ex H. Nozaki et A.W. Coleman, sp.\nnov. Asexual spheroids of V. ovalis are ovoid or elliptical, with a\nmonolayer of 1,000-2,000 somatic cells that are not linked by\ncytoplasmic bridges, an expanded anterior region, and 8 to 12 gonidia in\nthe posterior region. Visibly asymmetric cleavage divisions do not occur\nin V. ovalis embryos as they do V. carteri Stein, V. obversus (Shaw)\nPrintz and V. africanus West, so the gonidia of the next generation are\nnot yet recognizable in V. ovalis embryos prior to inversion. Molecular\nphylogenetic analyses of the five chloroplast genes and the internal\ntranscribed spacer regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA indicated that V.\novalis is closely related to V. spermatosphaera Powers and/or V. tertius\nMeyer; however, V. ovalis can be distinguished from V. spermatosphaera\nby its larger gonidia, and from V. tertius by visible differences in\ngonidial chloroplast morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox sect.
