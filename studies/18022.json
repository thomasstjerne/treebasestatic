The\nreconstruction revealed that Corynopuntia and Grusonia as currently\ndefined were polyphyletic. Quiabentia, Micropuntia, Pereskiopsis and\nCylindropuntia were the only genera recovered as monophyletic. Grusonia\ns.s. (only including G. bradtiana) is nested in a polytomy with the rest\nof the species of Corynopuntia. Grusonia s.l. (G. bradtiana plus\nCorynopuntia) and Corynopuntia as currently defined are polyphyletic\nbecause G. pulchella is sister to Pereskiopsis. Some previous taxonomic\nproposals for Cylindropuntia and Grusonia recognized polyphyletic series\nand subgenera that do not conform to the strongly sup- ported\nmonophyletic groups here recovered. This study proposes redefining the\npolyphyletic Grusonia excluding G. pulchella in order to recognize a\nstrongly supported monophyletic genus and the acceptance of a monotypic\nMicropuntia (G. pulchella) avoiding a new combination into Pereskiopsis.\nThe infrageneric classification for Grusonia is discussed and the\nrecognition of only four monophyletic strongly supported series\n(Bigelovianae, Imbricatae, Leptocaules and Ramosissimae) for\nCylindropuntia is presented","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89313","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_89313.phy"}]}
