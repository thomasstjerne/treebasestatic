Deliciosi was\ninvestigated employing both molecular and morphological characters. We\nused the nrDNA ITS sequences and an 800 bp fragment of the gene encoding\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd). Results confirm that\nLactarius sect. Deliciosi forms a monophyletic group within subgenus\nPiperites. The section contains nine accepted species in Europe, eight\nof which are traditionally being placed in sect. Deliciosi. Lactarius\nporninsis, a species with white latex that is usually classified in\nsect. Zonarii, also falls within in sect. Deliciosi. Some recently\ndescribed species are not confirmed here (L. sanguineovirescens) or\ntheir status remains doubtful because of a lack of collections (L.\ncyanopus). AFLP results show a clear distinction between the closely\nrelated L. deterrimus and L. fennoscandicus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius sect.
