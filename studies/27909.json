We study the phylogeny and diversity of Sidera\nherein by using both morphological and molecular methods. Phylogenetic\nanal-yses are based on ITS dataset, the combined 2-gene dataset\n(5.8S+nLSU) and 7-gene dataset (ITS+nLSU+RPB1+RPB2+TEF1+mtSSU+nSSU) of\n15 taxa of Sidera all over the world. Among these four species are new\nto science, viz.Â S. inflata, S. malaysiana, S. punctata and S.\nroseo-bubalina. In addition, three taxa are treated as Sidera vulgaris\nsensu lato. New species are all described and illustrated. An\nidentification key to 14 accepted species of Sidera in worldwide is\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Sidera and related species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132023.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Sidera new species and related\nspecies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132024.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Sidera and related species","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132025.phy"}]}
