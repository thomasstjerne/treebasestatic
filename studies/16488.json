Its generic assignment has been controversial,\nbeing included in Eudema, Brayopsis, and Onuris. In order to clarify its\ngeneric affinities, we studied its morphology and phylogenetic\nrelationships using multilocus/multispecies coalescent species-tree\nanalyses based in four DNA regions (ITS, trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and rps16\nintron). Results show that while O. hauthalii is related to Onuris s.s.,\nit represents a well-differentiated lineage characterized primarily by\nhaving branched rhizomes, rosette flowering with ebracteate flowers, and\nlatiseptate silicles. Based on the morphological and molecular evidence,\nwe place this species in the new monospecific genus Alshehbazia. A\ndescription, morphological key, updated geographical distributions, map,\nand illustration are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae ITS MCCT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78371.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnL-F MCCT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78372.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnH-psbA MCCT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78373.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae rps16 intron MCCT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78374.phy"}]}
