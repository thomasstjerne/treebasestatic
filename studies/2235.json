The group contains the most economically important of all\nbird species, each with a long history of domestication, and is an ideal\nmodel for studying ecological and evolutionary patterns. Yet, despite\nboth the socio-economic and biological importance of fowls, the\nspecies-level relationships within this clade remain controversial. Here\nwe used the supertree method matrix representation with parsimony to\ngenerate a robust estimate of species-level relationships of fowls. The\nsupertree represents one of the most comprehensive estimates for the\ngroup to date, including 376 species (83.2 % of all species; all 162\nAnseriformes and 214 Galliformes) and all but one genus. The supertree\nwas well-resolved (81.1","trees":[{"tree_label":"Galloanserae strict MRP","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Galloanserae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5459.phy"},{"tree_label":"Galloanserae majority Rule MRP","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Galloanserae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5460.phy"}]}
