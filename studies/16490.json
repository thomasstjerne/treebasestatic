A phylogenetic analysis including this species\nand 30 other Acarosporaceae shows that T. versipellis clearly belongs to\nthis family, but is not related to Polysporina subfuscescens (which is\nheterogeneous) nor to the genus Myriospora. It belongs to the same clade\nthan two morphologically and anatomically very distinct species,\nThelocarpella gordensis and Acarospora rhizobola. As a result, the genus\nTrimmatothelopsis is maintained (with a single species, T. versipellis),\nas well as the genus Thelocarpella (also monospecific), whereas\nAcarospora rhizobola, which has to be excluded from Acarospora, most\nprobably belongs to a new genus. T. versipellis is also compared with\nthree species of Melanophloea for which the taxonomic placement is still\ndebated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acaroporaceae RAxML mtSSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78376.phy"}]}
