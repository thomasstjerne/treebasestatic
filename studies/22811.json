In the Neotropical tribe Myrteae\n(Myrtaceae), species of two genera, Acca and Myrrhinium, offer fleshy,\nsugary petals to the consumption of birds that otherwise eat fruits,\nthus pollinating the plants in an unusual plant-animal interaction:\nfruit-bird ornithophily. The phylogenetic position of these genera has\nbeen problematic, and so it was the understanding of the evolution of\nthis interaction. Here we include new sequences of Myrrhinium\natropurpureum in a comprehensive molecular phylogeny based on two\nplastid and two nuclear markers, with the aim of providing the\nhistorical framework of the fruitbird ornithophily syndrome. We\ndeveloped and scored 13 flower and inflorescence characters that depict\nthe macroscopic morphological components of this syndrome. Bayesian and\nparsimony phylogenies concur in placing both Acca and Myrrhinium in a\nclade with Psidium species; with Myrrhinium sister to Psidium. Mapping\nof morphological characters indicated some degree of convergence (e.g.,\nfleshy petals, purplish display) but also considerable divergence in key\ncharacters that point to rather opposing pollination strategies and also\ndifferent degrees of specialization in Acca versus Myrrhinium.\nFruit-bird ornithophily represents a special case of mutualism that\nhighlights the evolutionary complexities of plant-animal\ninteractions","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mirtaceae ITS-ETS-psbA-matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112920.phy"}]}
