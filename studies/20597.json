Both sexual and asexual states of L. chinensis were\nobserved, which is characterized by its broadly clavate to clavate asci,\nfusiform, hyaline and aseptate ascospores, and initially hyaline,\naseptate, ovoid to ellipsoid conidia that become pigmented and\n1Â–2-septate with longitudinal striations when mature. Phylogenetically,\nL. chinensis is closely related to L. pseudotheobromae, L. sterculiae\nand L. lignicola. Morphological comparisons of these four species lead\nto the conclusion that the collected taxon is new to science.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107046.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107047.phy"}]}
