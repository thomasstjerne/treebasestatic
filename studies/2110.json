This system is\nparticularly difficult because under strict criteria of geographical\nconcordance coupled with estimates of genetic divergence, an unrealistic\nnumber of population lineages would qualify as species (20-60). Our\nnovel phylogeographic approach, which is generally applicable but\nparticularly relevant to highly structured systems, uses genealogical\nexclusivity to establish a topological framework to examine lineages for\ngenetic and ecological exchangeability in an effort to delimit cohesion\nspecies. Both qualitative assessments of habitat and niche-based\ndistribution modeling are employed to evaluate selective regime and\necological interchangeability among genetic lineages; adaptive\ndivergence among populations is weighted more heavily than simple\ngeographical concordance. Based on these analyses we conclude that five\ncohesion species should be recognized.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"153","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aptostichus atomarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3075.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aptostichus atomarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3076.phy"}]}
