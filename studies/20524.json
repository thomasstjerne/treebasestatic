It is characterized by producing annual, fragile and\nnodulose basidiomata, a monomitic hyphal system with clamp connections\non generative hyphae, hyaline, thin-walled and fusiform to mango-shaped\nbasidiospores (67.5 × 2.3 3 μm), and causing a typical brown rot. In\nphylogenetic analysis inferred from ITS and nLSU rDNA sequences, the new\nspecies forms a distinct lineage in the Antrodia s. l., and has a close\nrelationship with A. oleracea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antrodia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107814.phy"}]}
