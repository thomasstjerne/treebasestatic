This species\nresembles Cy. naviculatum, but is distinct in having longer and wider\nconidia. Sequence data derived from the beta-tubulin gene also support\nCy. pseudonaviculatum as being distinct from the taxa presently\nacknowledged in Cylindrocladium. No Calonectria teleomorph was observed\nin culture, and mating studies proved unsuccessful. Cy. insulare and Cy.\npauciramosum are also recorded for the first time from Vietnam, where\nthey are associated with leaf spot symptoms on Eucalyptus spp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cylindrocladium tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4047.phy"}]}
