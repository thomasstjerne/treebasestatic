The evidence for asiloid\nmonophyly is limited, and few characters define the relationships\nbetween the families of Asiloidea and Eremoneura. Additionally,\nenigmatic genera, Hilarimorpha and Apystomyia, retain morphological\ncharacters of both asiloids and higher flies. We use the nuclear\nprotein-coding gene CAD and 28S rDNA to test the monophyly of Asiloidea\nand to resolve its relationship to Eremoneura. We explore the effects of\ntaxon sampling on support values and topological stability, the\nresolving power of additional genes, and hypothesis-testing using\nfour-cluster likelihood mapping. We find that: (1) the ‘asiloid’ genus\nApystomyia is sister to Cyclorrhapha, (2) the remaining asiloids are\nmonophyletic at the exclusion of the family Bombyliidae, and (3) our\nbest estimate of relationships places the asiloid flies excluding\nBombyliidae as the sister group to Eremoneura, though high support is\nlacking.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asiloidea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25786.phy"}]}
