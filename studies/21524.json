(Phallomycetidae, Basidiomycota)","Journal":" MycoKeys","Volume":" 58","Issue":"","Pages":" 103-127","Keywords":" Phallus indusiatus, Neotropics, phalloid fungi, Amazonia,\nPhallales, ITS","DOI":"","Abstract":" Studies have demonstrated that cosmopolitan species\nactually consist of divergent clades that present high levels of\nmorphological stasis through their evolutionary histories. Phallus\nindusiatus s.l. has been described as a circumtropical species, although\nthis distribution may actually reflect the lack of taxonomic resolution\ndue to the small number of morphological diagnostic characters, which\nleads to the identification of new records as populations of P.\nindusiatus. Here, we examine the P. indusiatus-like species diversity in\nBrazilian Amazonia. We show a clear congruence between detailed\nmorphological data and ITS, nuc-LSU and atp6 based phylogenetic\nanalysis, and describe five new species and a new combination (Phallus\nindusiatus f. rosea) within the indusiate clade. These results highlight\nthe importance of more detailed investigation with the inclusion of\nmolecular information in Neotropical fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133603.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133602.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phallus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133604.phy"}]}
