Low coverage genome assemblies were\nsequenced for all Rhizopogon species-level clades and a novel data\nmining method, genome-scale sequence typing, was developed to produce a\ngenome-scale phylogenetic dataset. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic\nanalyses support a single evolutionary origin of the\nRhizopogon-Pseudotsuga ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in coastal western\nNorth America with a single migration into Asia and two independent\nmigrations east into the Intermountain West of North America. Our\nresults suggest that the Rhizopogon-Pseudotsuga ectomycorrhizal\nsymbiosis predates species radiation in Pseudotsuga and that these\ngenera have undergone processes of comigration and\ncodiversification.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110435","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110435.phy"}]}
