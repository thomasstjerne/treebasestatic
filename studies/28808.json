All species were isolated from Rhododendron sp. in\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China. All taxa are described based on\nmorphology and DNA sequence data analyzed to infer their phylogenetic\nrelationships. A multigene phylogenetic analysis based on LSU, ITS,\nRPB2, TEF1 and TUB2 sequence data indicate that Discosia\nrhododendronicola is closely related to Discosia muscicola.\nNeopestalotiopsis rhododendronicola and Diaporthe nobilis, reported\nherein as a new geographical record for China and its phylogeny is\ndepicted based on ITS, TEF1 and TUB2 sequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133778.phy"}]}
