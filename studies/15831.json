The origin of SIVs in\nprimates is not well understood. Endogenous lentiviral ancestors of SIVs\nhave previously been found in two species of lemur living in Madagascar,\nraising questions about how these viruses passed from Madagascar to the\nmainland. We have identified and characterised the first endogenous\nlentivirus in a mainland African primate, the Mohol bushbaby, which\nappears to be another ancestor of modern SIVs. We therefore propose that\nSIVs in old world monkeys are the result of a direct transmission from\nother mainland African primates. The Mohol bushbaby lentivirus is\nextremely similar to the lemur lentiviruses, so we also propose routes\nthrough which lentiviruses circulating in mainland primates may have\nreached Madagascar.","trees":[{"tree_label":"pSIVmb","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Endogenous lentiviruses pSIVmb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75128.phy"}]}
