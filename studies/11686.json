Here, the most\ncomprehensive fern phylogeny to date, representing over one-fifth of the\nextant global fern diversity, is inferred based on four plastid genes.\nParsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses provided a mostly congruent\nresults and in general supported the prevailing view on the higher-level\nfern systematics. At a deep phylogenetic level, the position of\nhorsetails depended on the optimality criteria chosen, with horsetails\npositioned as the sister group either of Marattiopsida-Polypodiopsida\nclade or of the Polypodiopsida. The analyses demonstrate the power of\nusing a ‘supermatrix’ approach to resolve large-scale phylogenies and\nreveal questionable taxonomies. These results provide a valuable\nbackground for future research on fern systematics, ecology,\nbiogeography and other evolutionary studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"2957","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ferns Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47158.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"2957","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ferns Tree of Life","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47159.phy"}]}
