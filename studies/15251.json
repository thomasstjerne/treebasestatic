These included the aeroaquatic fungal\nspecies Cancellidium applanatum and mitosporic ascomycetes, Cordana\nabramovii and Sporoschisma saccardoi. These taxa are reported herein\nfrom the neotropics with an accompanying phylogeny based on partial 28S\nnuclear ribosomal large-subunit sequence data. The teleomorph of S.\nsaccardoi has been linked to Melanochaeta hemipsila through cultural\nstudies. Molecular data from ascospores and conidia of S. saccardoi were\nused to show a genetic anamorph-teleomorph connection for the first time\nresulting in a new combination, Sporoschisma hemipsila. Cancellidium\napplanatum, Cordana abramovii, S. juvenile and S. uniseptatum are\nreported herein as new records for Perú.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dematiaceous microfungi 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70171.phy"}]}
