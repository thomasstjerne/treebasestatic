Despite good support for the\norder, molecular studies to date have suggested contradictory, poorly\nsupported interfamilial relationships. Our reappraisal of relationships\nwithin Fabales addresses past taxon sampling deficiencies, and employs\nparsimony and Bayesian approaches using sequences from the plastid\nregions rbcL (166 spp.) and matK (78 spp.). Five alternative hypotheses\nfor interfamilial relationships within Fabales were recovered. The\nShimodaira-Hasegawa test found the likelihood of a resolved topology\nsignificantly higher than the one calculated for a polytomy, but did not\nfavour any of the alternative hypotheses of relationship within Fabales.\nIn the light of the morphological evidence available and the comparative\nbehavior of rbcL and matK, the topology recovering Polygalaceae as\nsister to the rest of the order Fabales with Leguminosae more closely\nrelated to Quillajaceae + Surianaceae, is considered the most likely\nhypothesis of interfamilial relationships of the order. Dating of\nselected crown clades in the Fabales phylogeny using penalized\nlikelihood, suggests rapid radiation of the Leguminosae, Polygalaceae\nand (Quillajaceae + Surianaceae) crown clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"data set 2 rbcL","ntax":"166","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Strict consensus tree from parsimony analysis\nof rbcL sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3177.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree 2","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Combined rbcL matK partial taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3178.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Post burn-in trees used for chronogram\ncalculation based on matK","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3179.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Six MP trees from parsimony analysis of matK\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3180.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus tree 1","ntax":"169","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Combined rbcL matK all taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3181.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabales, Chronogram based on one of the post burn-in\nmatK trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3182.phy"}]}
