Our study applies\nmolecular phylogenetic methods to test the monophyly and relationships\nof Mertensia. We used DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal nrITS\nregion and four cpDNA regions (matK, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-trnF) to examine\nthe placement of Mertensia among a sampling of accessions from\napproximately 70% of the genera of Boraginaceae s. l. Phylogeny\nreconstructions using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and\nBayesian inference were largely congruent with previous molecular\nphylogenetic analyses of Boraginaceae that had applied far fewer taxa.\nWe recovered five deep clades that correspond to Boraginaceae\nsubfamilies Boraginoideae, Cordioideae, Heliotropioideae,\nHydrophylloideae, and Ehretioideae (including Lennoa and Pholisma). In\nsub- family Boraginoideae, we recovered clades that correspond to the\ntribes Echiochilieae, Lithospermeae, Cynoglosseae, and Boragineae,\nalthough several tribes previously circumscribed on the basis of\nmorphological data were not recovered as monophyletic in our results.\nBased on the sister relationship between the genus Codon and subfamily\nBoraginoideae found in our phylogeny reconstructions, we propose\nCodoneae as a new tribe of Boraginoideae. We recovered strong support\nfor the monophyly of Mertensia and the placement of the monotypic genus\nAsperugo as its sister. Mertensia and Asperugo were strongly supported\nas members of Cynoglosseae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best maximum likelihood tree from combined data\nanalysis","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 4","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 5","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum likelihood tree bootstrap from combined data\nanalysis","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 2","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48920.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 3","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48921.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48932","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48932.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 1","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48927","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48927.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48929","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48929.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 6","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48924","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48924.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 8","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48926","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48926.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict consensus maximum parsimony","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48928","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48928.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"191","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48930","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48930.phy"},{"tree_label":"Parsimony tree 7","ntax":"208","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48925","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48925.phy"}]}
