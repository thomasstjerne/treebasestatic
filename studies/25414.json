The main aim of this study was\nto elucidate the lifestyle evolutionary patterns, and to readdress the\nphylogenetic backbone of Capnodiales by including numerous new\ncollections of sooty moulds, and using four nuclear loci, LSU, ITS,\nTEF-1Î± and RPB2. Based on these results Capnodiales is shown to be\npolyphyletic, representing seven different orders. The sooty moulds are\nrestricted to Capnodiales s. str., while Mycosphaerellales is\nresurrected, and five new orders including Cladosporiales,\nComminutisporales, Neophaeothecales, Phaeothecales and Racodiales are\nintroduced. Four families, three genera, 21 species and five\ncombinations are introduced as new. Furthermore, ancestral\nreconstruction analysis revealed that saprophytic lifestyle is a\nprimitive state within Capnodiales s. lat., and several transitions have\noccurred to evolve lichenised, plant and human parasitic, ectophytic\n(Sooty blotch and flyspeck) and more recently epiphytic (sooty mould)\nlifestyles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Capnodiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121731.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Capnodiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121732.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"193","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Capnodiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121733.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"193","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Capnodiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121734.phy"}]}
