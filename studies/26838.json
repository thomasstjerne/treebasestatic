These species belong in\nthe Lc. heinemannii species complex, based on their morphological and\nmolecular characteristics. The type collection of Lc. heinemannii was\nsequenced, and we confirm the tropical distribution of this species\noriginally described from Italy. We discuss the problematic taxonomy of\ndark-centered species of Leucocoprinus, including the application of the\nnames Lepiota montagnei, Lepiota atrodisca, and Lepiota\nphaeosticta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucocoprinus heinemannii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_131198.phy"}]}
