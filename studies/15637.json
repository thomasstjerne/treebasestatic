Morphological evidence suggested\nthat this bird was an adult female of the nominate Atlantic subspecies.\nWe obtained genomic DNA from faeces left by the bird. Mitochondrial DNA\nfrom the control region (CR2) was sequenced and compared to extensive\nBrown Booby CR2 data available in GenBank, and corroborated the\nmorphological hypothesis. This is the first time that a vagrant bird has\nbeen identified using DNA extracted from faeces.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr72594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_72594.phy"}]}
