Phylogenetic\nsequence analysis of isolates and available environmental and reference\nsequences indicates that this new species, A. rhizophila, has a broad\ngeographic and host range. Atractiella rhizophila appears to be present\nin North America, Australia, Asia, and Africa and is associated with\ntrees, orchids, and other agriculturally important species, including\nsoybean, corn, and rice. Despite the large geographic and host range of\nthis species sampling, A. rhizophila appears to have exceptionally low\nsequence variation within nuclear rDNA markers examined. With\ninoculation studies, we demonstrate that A. rhizophila is nonpathogenic,\nasymptomatically colonizes plant roots, and appears to foster plant\ngrowth and elevated photosynthesis rates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Atractiella rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113001.phy"}]}
