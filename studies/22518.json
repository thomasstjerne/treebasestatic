The new species are supported by morphology, secondary\nchemistry and DNA sequence data. Krogia borneensis and K. isidiata\ncontain sekikaic and homosekikaic acid, both compounds reported here for\nthe first time from the genus. Krogia macrophylla contains an unknown\ncompound apparently related to boninic acid as the major compound. DNA\nsequences (mtSSU and nrITS) are provided for the first time for Krogia\nand a phylogeny of the genus based on 15 accessions of five of the six\naccepted species is presented. Krogia antillarum is reported as new to\nBrazil, Guatemala and Mexico.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114151.phy"}]}
