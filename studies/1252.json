Specifically, the traditional\ndichotomy between Iguania (anoles, iguanas, chameleons, etc.) and\nScleroglossa (skinks, gekkos, snakes, etc.) has been correlated with\nmajor evolutionary shifts within Squamata. We present a molecular\nphylogenetic study of 69 squamate species using approximately 4600 (2876\nparsimony-informative) base pairs (bp) of DNA sequence data from the\nnuclear genes RAG-1 (~2750 bp) and c-mos (~360 bp) and the mitochondrial\nND2 region (~1500 bp), sampling all major clades and most major\nsubclades. Under our hypothesis, species previously placed in Iguania,\nAnguimorpha, and almost all recognized squamate families form strongly\nsupported monophyletic groups. However, species previously placed in\nScleroglossa, Varanoidea, and several other higher taxa do not form\nmonophyletic groups. Iguania, the traditional sister group of\nScleroglossa, is actually highly nested within Scleroglossa. This\nunconventional rooting does not seem to be due to long-branch\nattraction, base composition biases among taxa, or convergence caused by\nsimilar selective forces acting on non-sister taxa. Studies of\nfunctional tongue morphology and feeding mode have contrasted the\nsimilar states found in Sphenodon (the nearest outgroup to squamates)\nand Iguania with those of Scleroglossa, but our findings suggest that\nsimilar states in Sphenodon and Iguania result from homoplasy. Snakes,\namphisbaenians, and dibamid lizards, limbless forms whose phylogenetic\npositions historically have been impossible to place with confidence,\nare not grouped together and appear to have evolved this condition\nindependently. Amphisbaenians are the sister group of lacertids, and\ndibamid lizards diverged early in squamate evolutionary history. Snakes\nare grouped with iguanians, lacertiforms and anguimorphs, but are not\nnested within anguimorphs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_229.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAG1 cmos MP","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_296.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_469.phy"},{"tree_label":"mtDNA MP","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_641.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7B","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1959.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cmos MP","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1956.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7A","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1958.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAG1 MP","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1954.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1955.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Squamata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1957.phy"}]}
