However, at the species level, taxonomic information\nfor identification purposes is limited. The objective of the present\nstudy was to confirm the identity of the Schizophyllum species present\nin Tabasco, Mexico, by means of a detailed taxonomic revision of the\nmacro- and micromorphological characters in more than 90 specimens, as\nwell as phylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS sequence data. In total,\nthree Schizophyllum species are described, of which one constitute a new\nrecord for Mexico. Finally, the edibility of S. radiatum is reported for\nthe first time in the humid tropical region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116776","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116776.phy"}]}
