Four taxa have been\nnamed: Brachyceratops montanensis, Rubeosaurus ovatus, Einiosaurus\nprocurvicornis, and Achelousaurus horneri. Rubeosaurus has been\nhistorically the most enigmatic of these taxa; only two specimens, the\nholotype caudal parietal bar and a referred incomplete skull, have been\nassigned to Rubeosaurus. A revised interpretation of the parietal\nprocesses of USNM 14765, the partial skeleton of a subadult\ncentrosaurine formerly referred to Brachyceratops, indicates that it\nshares a P5 spike with the holotype of Rubeosaurus ovatus and should\ntherefore be referred to that taxon. Brachyceratops is considered a\nnomen dubium. USNM 14765 provides additional anatomical information for\nRubeosaurus ovatus. These new data are incorporated into a recent\nphylogenetic analysis of centrosaurine relationships; Rubeosaurus\nappears as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Einiosaurus,\nAchelousaurus, and Pachyrhinosaurus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 12","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsidae Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55341.phy"}]}
