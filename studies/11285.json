However, a phylogenetic analysis of DNA\nsequence data indicates that Epidendrum kienastii, currently included in\nEncyclia, belongs in a separate, strongly supported clade as the sister\nof Alamania, from which it differs markedly in vegetative and floral\nmorphology. Here we refer Epidendrum kienastii to a new, monotypic\ngenus, Amoana. It is easily distinguished from other genera of Laeliinae\nby the following set of characters: pseudobulbs narrowly-cylindric,\nleaves lanceolate, callus with two conspicuous, divergent, digitiform\nprocesses on the base of the mid lobe of the labellum, and column\nreflexed in the middle. It is endemic to mid-elevations of south-central\nMexico.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS+trnL-F","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amoana, Consensus ITS+trnL-F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31098.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amoana","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31100.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amoana, Consensus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31099.phy"}]}
