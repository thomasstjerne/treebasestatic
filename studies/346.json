With these nucleotide sequences and homologous sequences for\nfive species of hominoids, we constructed a phylogenetic tree for the\nfour groups of primates. The phylogeny obtained is generally consistent\nwith evolutionary trees constructed in previous studies. Our results\nalso suggest that the rate of nucleotide substitution for mtDNAs in\nhominines (human, chimpanzee, and gorilla) may have slowed down compared\nwith that for old-world monkeys. This evolutionary feature of\nmitochondrial genes is similar to one found in nuclear genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Primates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3234.phy"}]}
