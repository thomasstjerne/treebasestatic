A total of\n241 morphospecies were obtained corresponding to 62 taxa that were\nidentified by analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the\nribosomal DNA (rDNA). The Phylum Ascomycota predominated, representing\n99% and 95.2% of isolates in the Monsoy and Conquista cultivars,\nrespectively, whereas the Phylum Basidiomycota represented 1% and 4.8%\nof isolates, respectively. The genera Ampelomyces, Annulohypoxylon,\nGuignardia, Leptospora, Magnaporthe, Ophiognomonia, Paraconiothyrium,\nPhaeosphaeriopsis, Rhodotorula, Sporobolomyces and Xylaria for the first\ntime were isolated from soybean; this suggests that soybean harbours\nnovel and highly diverse fungi. The yeasts genera Rhodotorula and\nSporobolomyces (subphylum Pucciniomycotina) represent the Phylum\nBasidiomycota. The species richness was greater when both isolation\ntechniques were used. The diversity of fungal endophytes was similar in\nboth cultivars when the same isolation technique was used except for\nHills index, N1. The use of ITS region sequences allowed the isolates to\nbe grouped according to Order, Class and Phylum. Ampelomyces, Chaetomium\nand Phoma glomerata are endophytic species that may play potential roles\nin the biological control of soybean pathogens. This study is one of the\nfirst to apply extinction-culturing to isolate fungal endophytes in\nplant leaves, thus contributing to the development and improvement of\nthis technique for future studies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conquista ITS rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53956.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Monsoy ITS rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53957.phy"}]}
