We sequenced\nthe genes 12S and ND2 and estimated phylogenetic trees. The H. mabouia\nsequence found in Rivera City was unique and more closely related to a\nwidely distributed haplotype found in Brazil, Argentina, and the\nCaribbean. The S. azureus from near Masoller (Salto) grouped with a\nsample of S. azureus from Bajada de Pena (Rivera). We encourage further\nsampling in order to assess the population structure of H. mabouia in\nRivera City and to delineate potential conservation units of S. azureus\nin the region.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenocercus azureus and Hemidactylus mabouia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114740.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stenocercus azureus and Hemidactylus mabouia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114739.phy"}]}
