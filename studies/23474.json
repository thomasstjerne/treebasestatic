Here we test the\nreliability of this approach using the Hominidae family of primates\nwhose consensus phylogeny is well accepted. We used the software\nRepeatExplorer to identify the different repetitive DNA clusters and\nquantify their abundances. With this data we performed phylogenetic\nanalyses by maximum parsimony, including one, two or three individuals\nper species, technical replicates, and including or discarding two\nclusters of repetitive elements (i.e. a satellite DNA and an endogenous\nretrovirus) that generated random homoplasy, because they were abundant\nin Pan and Gorilla but almost absent in Homo and Pongo. The only\nphylogenetic tree congruent with the accepted topology for hominids,\nthus coinciding with that obtained from the mitogenomes of the same\nindividuals, was the one built after filtering out the libraries for the\ntwo homoplasious clusters and using three individuals per species. Our\nresults suggest some caution in the use of repeat abundance for\nphylogenetic studies, as some element abundances are homoplasious, which\nseverely distorts the phylogenetic signal due to their differential\namplification among evolutionary lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"1samples group3 unfiltered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114592.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus 1sample mix","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114589","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114589.phy"},{"tree_label":"1samples group2 filtered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114590","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114590.phy"},{"tree_label":"1samples group3 filtered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114593.phy"},{"tree_label":"2samples group3 filtered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114630","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114630.phy"},{"tree_label":"1samples group1 filtered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hominid Primates 1 sample group1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114557.phy"},{"tree_label":"1samples group2 unfiltered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114591","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114591.phy"},{"tree_label":"2samples group1 filtered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114594","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114594.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 samples group1 unfiltered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114595","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114595.phy"},{"tree_label":"consensus 2samples mix","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114626.phy"},{"tree_label":"2 samples group2 unfiltered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114627.phy"},{"tree_label":"2samples group3 unfiltered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114628","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114628.phy"},{"tree_label":"2samples group2 filtered","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114629","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114629.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 samples filtered","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114631","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114631.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 samples unfiltered","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114632","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114632.phy"},{"tree_label":"1samples group1 unfiltered","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114558","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114558.phy"}]}
