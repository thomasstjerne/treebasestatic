The utility of three independent character sets was assessed.\nThe first data set comprised the sequences of the 63 genes common to\nthese viruses. The second set of characters was based on gene order and\nphylogenies were inferred using both breakpoint distance analysis and a\nnovel method developed here termed neighbor pair analysis. The third set\nrecorded gene content by scoring gene presence or absence in each\ngenome. All three datasets yielded phylogenies supporting the separation\nof the Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) and Granulovirus (GV) genera, the\ndivision of the NPVs into groups I and II, and species relationships\nwithin group I NPVs. Generation of phylogenies based on the combined\nsequences of all 63 shared genes proved to be the most effective\napproach to resolving the relationships among the group II NPVs and GVs.\nThe history of gene acquisitions and losses that have accompanied\nbaculovirus diversification was visualized by mapping the gene content\ndata onto the phylogenetic tree. This analysis highlighted the fluid\nnature of baculovirus genomes, with evidence of frequent genome\nrearrangements and multiple gene content changes during their evolution.\nOf more than 416 genes identified in the genomes analyzed, only 63 are\npresent in all nine genomes, and 200 genes are only found in a single\ngenome. Despite this fluidity, the whole genome based methods we\ndescribe are sufficiently powerful to recover the underlying phylogeny\nof the viruses","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1b,
