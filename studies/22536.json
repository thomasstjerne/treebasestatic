The key step in the evolution under domestication\nof cereal crops is the elimination of seed dispersal traits. Here we\nshow that ObSH3, a YABBY transcript factor, is required for the\ndevelopment of the seed abscission layer and that selecting a genomic\nsegment deletion containing SH3 resulted in the loss of seed dispersal\nin populations of African cultivated rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.).\nFunctional characterization of SH3 and SH4 (another gene controls seed\nshattering on chromosome 4) together revealed that multiple genes can\nlead to a spectrum of non-shattering phenotypes, affecting other traits\nsuch as ease of threshing that may be important to tune across different\nagroecologies and postharvest practices. The molecular evolution\nanalysis of SH3 and SH4 in a panel of 93 landraces provide unforeseen\ngeographic detail of African rice domestication history, tracing\nmultiple dispersals from a core heartland and introgression from local\nwild rice. Identification of ObSH3 provides new insights into a critical\ncrop domestication process and also sheds light on the molecular\nmechanism underlying abscission layer development.","trees":[{"tree_label":"OG_OB_tree","ntax":"187","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"93_Oglaberrima_94_Obarthii_tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110825.phy"}]}
