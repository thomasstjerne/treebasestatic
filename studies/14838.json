Here, we analysed two mitochondrial (COI, Cytb) and four\nnuclear genes (ITS2, EF-1α, RpL27a, mago nashi) from a worldwide sample\nof 56 sycoecine species. Various alignment and partitioning strategies\nwere used to test the stability of major clades. All topologies\nestimated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods were similar and\nwell resolved but did not support the existing classification. A high\ndegree of morphological convergence was highlighted and several species\nappeared best described as species complexes. We therefore proposed a\nnew classification for the subfamily. Our analyses revealed several\ncases of probable speciation on the same host trees (up to 8 closely\nrelated species on one single tree of F. sumatrana), which raises the\nquestion of how resource partitioning occurs to avoid competitive\nexclusion. Comparisons of our results with fig phylogenies showed that,\ndespite sycoecines being internally ovipositing wasps host-switches are\ncommon incidents in their evolutionary history. Finally, by studying the\nevolutionary properties of the markers we used and profiling their\nphylogenetic informativeness, we predicted their utility for resolving\nphylogenetic relationships of Chalcidoidea at various taxonomic\nlevels.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BayesClustal6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67506.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustal5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67507","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67507.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustal6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67508","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67508.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesClustal5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67505.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesClustalGBDefault6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67510","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67510.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustalGBdefault5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67511","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67511.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustalGBdefault6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67512","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67512.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesClustalGBlockDefault5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67509","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67509.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFTGBrelax6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67528","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67528.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesClustalGBlockrelax6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67514","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67514.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustalGBrelax5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67515","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67515.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLClustalGBrelax6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67516","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67516.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesClustalGBlockrelax5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67513","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67513.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFT6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67518.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFT5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67519","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67519.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFT6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67520","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67520.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFT5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67517.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFTGBlockDefault5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67521","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67521.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFTGBlockDefault6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67522","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67522.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFTGBdefault5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67523","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67523.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFTGBdefault6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67524","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67524.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFTGBlockRelax6part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67526","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67526.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXMLMAFFTGBrelax5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67527","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67527.phy"},{"tree_label":"BayesMAFFTGBlockRelax5part","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr67525","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_67525.phy"}]}
