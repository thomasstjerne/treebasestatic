Results\nWe investigated 104 SBP-box genes from moss, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice,\nand maize. These genes are divided into group I and II, and the latter\nis further divided into two subgroups (subgroup II-1 and II-2) based on\nphylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, subgroup II-1 genes have similar\nsequence and structural features to group I genes, whereas subgroup II-2\ngenes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high\ncopy numbers and the presence of miR156/miR529 regulation. Further\nanalyses indicate that subgroup II-1 genes are constrained by stronger\npurifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than II-2\ngenes, just as group I genes do when compared to II genes. Among\nsubgroup II-2 genes, miR156 targets evolve more rapidly than miR529\ntargets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection. These\nresults suggest that group I and subgroup II-1 genes under strong\nselective constraint are conserved. By contrast, subgroup II-2 genes\nevolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through\ngene copy duplications and changes in miR156/529 regulation, which might\ncontribute to morphological diversifications of land plants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90461","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90461.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90462","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90462.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90463","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90463.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90464","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90464.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90469.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"105","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90471.phy"}]}
