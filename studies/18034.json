Bayesian and maximum likelihood\nanalyses of two sequence marker datasets confirmed that Collolechia\ncaesia is nested within Placynthium, and should be called Placynthium\ncaesium (Fr.) Jatta. We re-assess the spore and ascus characteristics\nand conclude that Placynthium caesium falls well within the variation in\nPlacynthium and is thus yet another example of a species that differ\nfrom close relatives by an unusually crustose-leprose thallus\nstructure.","trees":[{"tree_label":"GARLI_best_tree_24T","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr89373","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89373.phy"}]}
