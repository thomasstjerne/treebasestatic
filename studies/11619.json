Two different\nsubstrates, dried small shrimps and petals of hibiscus flowers, were\nselected as baits. Soil samples were collected from temperate and\nsubtropical regions in Japan. Six genera 16 species widely distributed\nin Mucorales and Mortierellales lineages were isolated, suggesting the\nbaiting method is useful for the biodiversity survey of mucoralean and\nallied fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Zygo28SNJ","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mucoralean and Allied Fungi","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52413.phy"}]}
