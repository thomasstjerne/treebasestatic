Poeobius meseres was\nrecently shown to be part of Flabelligeridae and flotids have also been\nallied to Flabelligeridae. Our results show that Flota is nested among\nflabelligerids based on partial sequences of five genes, thus making\nFlotidae a junior synonym of Flabelligeridae. Relationships within\nFlabelligeridae show that Poeobius and Flota are not sister groups. They\nare only distantly related within the family and so pelagicism has\narisen twice within Flabelligeridae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 28S","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 18S","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5203.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 COI","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5204.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 Cyt B","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5205.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5201.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 16S","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Flabelligeridae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5202.phy"}]}
