To identify genetic changes associated with\nthe development of bat-specific traits, we performed whole-genome\nsequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly related bat\nspecies, fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous Myotis davidii. We\ndiscovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in\nthe DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factorâ“ÎºB pathways that may be\nrelated to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of\nimportant gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian\nspecies has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58985","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58985.phy"}]}
