In addition to this isolate, two isolates were\nobtained from Prostigmata mites. Those three Verticillium-like fungi\nwere morphologically similar and identical in LSU rDNA D1/D2 regions\nsequences. Further taxonomic study based on morphology and phylogenetic\nanalysis using ITS rDNA region sequences revealed that the three\nisolates were the same species and assigned to the genus Leptobacillium.\nThen, the present fungus was revealed to be a novel species,\nmorphologically and phylogenetically distinguished from the type species\nLeptobacillium leptobactrum, and we proposed Leptobacillium symbioticum\nsp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FigureITS","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119653.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120267.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120268.phy"}]}
