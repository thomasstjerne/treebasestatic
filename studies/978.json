The polyploid species of\nTarasa are particularly unusual because they have life histories and\nfloral morphologies that contradict two traditional polyploid dogmas:\nthey are annuals and have smaller floral features (including pollen)\nthan the diploid species. Typically, polyploids are perennial and larger\nthan their parents. Nuclear (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) and chloroplast\n(psbA-trnH and trnT-trnL spacers, matK-3â€™trnK intron) sequence data were\nused to reconstruct independent phylogenies to test the monophyly of the\ngenus, determine its sister group(s), and investigate the origin of the\npolyploid species. Neither the nuclear nor the chloroplast phylogeny\nsupports monophyly of Tarasa as currently circumscribed. The high Andean\ngenus Nototriche, the North/South American disjunct genus Sphaeralcea,\nand Malacothamnus chilensis are placed within the Tarasa clade. The\npolyploid species of Tarasa are not monophyletic and thus have been\ngenerated multiple times. These findings suggest that the unusual\nmorphological features of the tetraploids are the result of convergent\nevolution and not shared ancestry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tarasa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5784.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tarasa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5785.phy"}]}
