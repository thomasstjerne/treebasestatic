The fungus, collected on near dead to living stems and\nbranches of Phyllostachys heteroclada, is characterized by having lyard\nor pale brown disc, buff to yellow receptacle, pale brown to brown\nhymenium, clavate, cylindrical-clavate or wormlike ascospores, and\nsemiparasitic to parasitic on host. The phylogenetic position of B.\nheteroclada was determined by sequences analysis of the nuclear\nribosomal DNA large subunit. The distinctions between the new species\nand related taxa are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108834","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108834.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108833","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_108833.phy"}]}
