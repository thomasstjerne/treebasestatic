The\nisolates consistently grouped together in a distinct and highly\nsupported clade; all other Lulworthiales analyzed, including the\navailable sequences of Lulworthia spp., segregated separately. These\nresults were supported by common and distinctive morphological\ncharacters and enabled recognition and description of the new species\nLulworthia atlantica. Two Portuguese isolates were confirmed as\nLulworthia cf.Â purpurea, and two were confirmed as asexual morphs of\nZalerion maritima.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Portuguese Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90799.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Portuguese Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90797.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Portuguese Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90798.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Portuguese Lulworthiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_90800.phy"}]}
