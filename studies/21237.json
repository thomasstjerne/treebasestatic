The analysis of nuclear ribosomal sequence data from the\n5.8s+nLSU+RPB1 genes with maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods,\nindicated that phylogenetic placement of the three species, is in\nPhanerochaete s.s. An additional analysis of the ITS region, revealed\ntheir phylogenetic relationships among the Phanerochaete s.s. P.\nbambusicola was found on dead bamboo culm, characterized in having loose\ntexture of subiculum, leptocystidia, and subicular hyphae sometimes bear\na short lateral branch. P. incarnata is characterized in having pink\nhymenial surface, and leptocystidia usually covered with yellowish\nresinous material. P. robusta distribtutes in NE Asia is re-described as\nhaving immersed leptocystidia that are usually irregularly swollen and\nwith oily drops.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105630","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105630.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105629","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105629.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107840","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107840.phy"}]}
