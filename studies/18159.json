As part of an ongoing effort to characterize Amazon\nrainforest-derived endophytes, numerous fungi were isolated and cultured\nfrom plants collected in the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. Of these\nsamples, phylogenetic and morphological data revealed a previously\nundescribed fungus in the order Pleosporales that was cultured from the\ntropical tree Duroia hirsuta. Extracts from this fungal isolate\ndisplayed activity against Staphylococcus aureus and were thus subjected\nto detailed chemical studies. Two compounds with modest antibacterial\nactivity were isolated and their structures were elucidated using a\ncombination of NMR spectroscopic analysis, LC-MS studies, and chemical\ndegradation. These efforts led to the identification of stelliosphaerols\nA (1) and B (2), new sesquiterpene-polyol conjugates that are\nresponsible, at least in part, for the S. aureus inhibitory activity of\nthe fungal extract.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stelliosphaera formicum LSU, SSU, TEF1, and RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92305.phy"}]}
