However,\ncharacteristic symptoms of Botryosphaericeae have been observed in\navocado orchards throughout the country, leading to economic losses.\nThus, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity and pathogenicity of\nBotryosphaericeae species associated with cankers and dieback of avocado\ntrees, located in the Perus Pacific coastline. On the basis of\nmorphological and cultural characters, as well as phylogenetic analysis\nof the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and part of the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α gene (tef1-α), the isolates were\nidentified as belonging to three botryosphaeriaceous species such as\nLasiodiplodia theobromae, L. laeliocattleyae and L. pseudotheobromae.\nInoculation in cv. ‘Hass’ plants confirmed the pathogenicity of\nLasiodiplodia species and revealed differences in aggressiveness among\nspecies and isolates. Lasiodiplodia laeliocattleyae is reported for the\nfirst time in avocado trees associated with cankers symptoms, which\ntogether with L. theobromae and L. pseudotheobromae may clearly\nrepresent a threat to Peruvian avocado plantations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135246.phy"}]}
