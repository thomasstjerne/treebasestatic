To revaluate and delimit the genus Conidiobolus,\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed using the large and\nsmall subunits of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nucLSU and nucSSU), the small\nsubunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (mtSSU) and the translation\nelongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α). The result conformed that the\nConidiobolus is not monophyletic, being grouped into four clades, with a\nrecovered genus Delacroixia and three new genera Capillidium,\nMicroconidiobolus and Neoconidiobolus. Consequently, the wellknown\nConidiobolus was rejected and 34 new combinations were proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidiobolus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117284.phy"}]}
