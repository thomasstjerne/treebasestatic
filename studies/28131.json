These two new\nspecies are nested within the clades of Fomitopsis sensu stricto and\nOligoporus sensu stricto respectively, based on molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses inferred from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions,\nthe large subunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the small\nsubunit of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nuSSU), the small subunit of\nmitochondrial rRNA gene (mtSSU), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase\nII (RPB1), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) and\nthe translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1). Fomitopsis bambusae\nis characterized by its resupinate to effused-reflexed or pileate\nbasidiocarps, small pores (69 per mm), the absence of cystidia, short\ncylindrical to oblong-ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 4.26.1 × 22.3\nμm, and growing on bamboo. Oligoporus podocarpi is characterised by\nwhite to pale cream pore surface, round or sometimes angular pores (56\nper mm), a monomitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae,\nbroadly ellipsoid to reniform, hyaline, dextrinoid, cyanophilous\nbasidiospores measuring 3.84.2 × 22.3 μm, and growing on Podocarpus. The\ndiscriminating characteristics of two new species and their closely\nrelated species are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"brown rot polypores","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133956.phy"}]}
