The diversity\nand systematics of the genera within Discodorididae are poorly\nunderstood and have led to numerous taxonomic changes. Hoplodoris Bergh,\n1880 has recently been considered a synonym of Asteronotus Ehrenberg,\n1831; however, morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses reveal\na distinct separation between these two genera. Here we provide a\nre-description of the type species Hoplodoris desmoparypha as well as\ndescriptions of four undescribed species of Asteronotus and Hoplodoris.\nBayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of two mitochondrial\nand two nuclear genes were used to evaluate the phylogenetic positions\nof the new species and clarify the relationships between Asteronotus and\nHoplodoris to the rest of the Discodorididae. Based on our results,\nHoplodoris is removed from synonymy with Asteronotus. Descriptions for\nAsteronotus markaensis sp. nov., and Asteronotus namuro sp. nov. from\nthe Red Sea, as well as Hoplodoris balbon sp. nov. and Hoplodoris rosans\nsp. nov. from the western Pacific are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"16S RAxML","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125291.phy"},{"tree_label":"Four Gene RAxML","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 16S COI H3 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125286.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125290.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI RAxML","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125283.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125282.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3 Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Four Gene Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 16S COI H3 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_125287.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S RAxML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125289.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S Con 50 Majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125288.phy"},{"tree_label":"H3 RAxML","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Asteronotus Hoplodoris H3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125285.phy"}]}
