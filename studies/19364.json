The monophyly of Aesculus and Billia were widely\nassumed, but a recent molecular phylogenetic study of Sapindanceae used\nseven species of Aesculus and one each of Billia and Haneliodendron and\nshowed that Billia and Handeliodendron were nested within Aesculus.\nHere, we tested the hypothesis that Aesculus and Billia are mutually\nmonophyletic using phylogenetic analyses of seven molecular markers and\n31 accessions of Hippocastaneae representing 14 species. We performed\nphylogenetic analyses using a dataset of concatenated genes as well as\nwith coalescent method for constructing a species tree from individual\ngene trees. The analysis of seven concatenated markers and the species\ntree strongly supported the mutual monophyly of Aesculus and Billia. We\nalso recovered support for the traditional arrangement of genera within\nHippocastaneae: Aesculus and Billia comprising a clade that is sister to\nHandeliodendron. However, the relationships among the genera remain\nincompletely resolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"psbATree","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hippocastanoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96392.phy"},{"tree_label":"AT103Tree","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hippocastanoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96395.phy"},{"tree_label":"SQD1Tree","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96394","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96394.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLFTree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hippocastanoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96390.phy"},{"tree_label":"ycf1Tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hippocastanoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96389.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnSTree","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96391","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96391.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnCTree","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hippocastanoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96393.phy"}]}
