Leaves in many genera have two rows Or opposing vascular\nbundles (found also in many other Iridaceae), sometimes (except in\ne.g.Â Pillansia) combined with typical ixioid features such as a\nprominent pseudomidrib, mesophyll cells often elongated at right angles\nto the leaf axis, and epidermal cells also sometimes slightly laterally\nelongated, frequently with markedly sinuous anticlinal walls, and a\nsingle row of papillae per cell. Other characters are limited to a few\ngenera. Anatomical characters are used together with data from other\nsources to construct a cladogram for the group. Although anatomical\ncharacters in general show much homoplasy, the relationships of the\nexisting three tribes, Pillansieae, Watsonieae and Ixieae, diagnosed\nmainly on the basis of floral and inflorescence characters, are largely\nupheld by analysis, with at least two potentially useful subtribal\ngroupings within Ixieae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 22","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ixioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4253.phy"}]}
