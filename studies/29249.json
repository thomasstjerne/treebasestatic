The\nLaburnicola species include saprobes and endophytes with a wide variety\nof substrates. A collection in the subalpine region of Uzbekistan\ndiscovered a new Laburnicola species on the dead stem of a wild rose in\nterrestrial habitat. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of\ncombined LSU, SSU, ITS, and TEF dataset confirmed the new speciesâ€™\ntaxonomic position in Laburnicola. Our new species Laburnicola\nzaaminensis (TASM 6152) was claded to L. dactylidis (MFLUCC 16-0285)\nwith (ML=90%, BYPP= 1.00). A detailed description with illustrations is\nprovided for the new species, Laburnicola zaaminensis. This is the first\nreport of Laburnicola from Central Asia. In addition, an annotated\nspecies list, a geographic distribution map, and a diagnostic key to all\nLaburnicola species are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135081.phy"}]}
