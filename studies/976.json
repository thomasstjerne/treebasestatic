Species in Neosphaeria have 3- or\n4-septate ascospores and anamorphs that produce ovoid to ellipsoid,\nnonseptate, brown, verrucose or punctate conidia from percurrently\nproliferating conidiogenous cells. Paraphaeosphaeria barrii, P.\nconglomerata, P. filamentosa and P. quadriseptata are transferred to\nNeosphaeria. At present all species in the genus occur on Yucca\n(Agavaceae). Phaeosphaeriopsis is described for species that produce 4-\nor 5-septate ascospores. Known anamorphs produce cylindrical, 0- to 3-\nseptate, brown, punctate conidia from percurrently proliferating\nconidiogenous cells or bacillar conidia from phialides.\nParaphaeosphaeria agavensis, P. glauco-punctata, P. nolinae, and P.\nobtusispora are transferred to Phaeosphaeriopsis. Phaeosphaeriopsis\namblyspora is described as a new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Loculoascomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5780.phy"}]}
