Although Madagascar is known for its unique\nfauna and vascular flora, the countryÂ’s bryophyte flora in contrast is\nunderstudied and under collected. Arising from a bryophyte collecting\nexpedition undertaken in May-June 2016, the purpose of this paper is to\ndescribe a new species of simple thalloid liverwort, Fossombronia\nisaloensis, from Madagascar. Methods. Morphological traits across\nspecimens were reviewed and compared with related species. DNA sequence\ndata from rbcL, rps4 and trnL-trnF was obtained from 7 accessions of\nFossombronia from Madagascar and 18 other named species of the genus and\nused to produce a plastid-based phylogeny. Results and Conclusions. DNA\nsequence data show that Fossombronia isaloensis is not closely related\nto any other Fossombronia taxon sampled for this study. A description\nand diagnosis is provided and a type specimen designated for the new\nspecies. The bryophyte flora of Madagascar urgently deserves further\ninventory and taxonomic investigation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fossombronia rbcL, rsp4 and trnL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128342.phy"}]}
