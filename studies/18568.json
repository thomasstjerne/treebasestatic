Carlsward & Whitten\nis a leafless epiphytic orchid occurring in Florida (U. S. A.), the\nGreater Antilles, Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Previous\nmorphological and phylogenetic analyses revealed considerable variation\nacross its geographic range. This study examines morphological and\nmolecular variation among populations of D. porrectus. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of sequence data of nuclear (nrITS) and plastid (matK, ycf1)\nregions revealed several well-supported clades within D. porrectus.\nMolecular data and morphometric analyses of root thickness and floral\nparts support the recognition of two species within the D. porrectus\nclade. Dendrophylax megarhizus is described as a new species from\nCampeche, Jalisco, Veracruz and Yucat√°n states of Mexico. A key to the\nspecies of Dendrophylax is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendrophylax","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_92134.phy"}]}
