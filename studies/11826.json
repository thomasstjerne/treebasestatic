Generic concepts are drawn primarily from patterns in the\ndiversity of morphological complexity of the sporophyte. Phylogenetic\ninferences from ten loci sampled across the three genomic compartments\nyield a hypothesis that is incompatible with current circumscription of\ntwo of the speciose genera of the Funariaceae. The single clade,\ncomprising exemplars of Funaria with a compound annulus, is congruent\nwith the systematic concept proposed by Fife (1985). By contrast,\nEntosthodon and Physcomitrium are resolved as polyphyletic entities, and\neven the three species of Physcomitrella are confirmed to have diverged\nfrom distinct ancestors. Although the backbone relationships within the\ncore clade of the Funariaceae remain unresolved, the polyphyly of these\ngenera withstands alternative hypothesis testing. Consequently, the\nsporophytic characters that define these lineages are clearly\nhomoplasious suggesting that selective pressures (or their relaxation)\nare in fact driving the diversification rather than the conservation of\nsporophytic architecture in the Funariaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Funariaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47930.phy"}]}
