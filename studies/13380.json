We inferred the demographic history of Acroneuria frisoni\nStark & Brown, a widespread eastern North American stonefly, using\nthe mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI). Results show that\nthis population is highly structured and survived glaciations in at\nleast three refugia in the southern portion of the present day\ndistribution range. The population that recolonized the upper Midwest\noriginated from the refugium located in the Tennessee River valley. A\nsecond refugium was located in the southern portion of the Ozark\nMountains of Missouri and Arkansas and contributed marginally to the\nrecolonization of formerly glaciated areas. The third refugium was\nlikely located in the valleys of the Appalachian Mountains, and the\nhaplotypes that diverged therein are now distributed exclusively in\nsouthern Pennsylvania and in the Tennessee River valley. Results\nindicate that populations west of the Mississippi River have been\nisolated from those in the east for at least 180K years, suggesting that\nglacial cycles interrupted gene flow between these two regions and that\nthe present day Mississippi River and associated lowlands are an\neffective barrier to dispersal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"167","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57244","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_57244.phy"}]}
