Recent biogeographic studies have revealed many instances of\nlong-distance dispersal in gymnosperms, just as in angiosperms. Acting\ntogether, extinction and long-distance dispersal are likely to erase\nhistorical biogeographic signal. Notwithstanding this problem, we show\nthat phylogenetic relationships in the gymnosperm family Cupressaceae\n(162 species, 32 genera) exhibit patterns expected from the\nJurassic/Cretaceous breakup of Pangea. A phylogeny was generated for 122\nrepresentatives covering all genera, using up to 10,000 nucleotides of\nplastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear sequence per species. Relying on 16\nfossil calibration points and three molecular dating methods, we show\nthat Cupressaceae originated during the Triassic, when Pangea was\nintact. Vicariance between the two subfamilies, the Laurasian\nCupressoideae and the Gondwanan Callitroideae, occurred around 153 Ma\n(124-183 Ma), when Gondwana and Laurasia were separating. Three further\nintercontinental disjunctions, involving the Northern and Southern\nHemisphere, are coincidental with, or immediately followed, the breakup\nof Pangea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S5i","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52058.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5a","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5b","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5h","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5d","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5f","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52057.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5e","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52061.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5c","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52063.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S5g","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cupressaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52064.phy"}]}
