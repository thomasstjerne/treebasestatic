Even though the\nChytridiales is the largest order within Chytridiomycota, Brazilian\nisolates of this clade have been poorly integrated. Here, we isolated\nseven species and documented their morphology, including zoospore\nultrastructure for one species?, and phylogenetic positions for all\nbased on analyses of nuc 18S rDNA (18S), nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS),\nand nuc 28S rDNA (28S). Phylogenetic results support the placement of\nfive species among the Asterophlyctaceae, Chytriomycetaceae, and\nChytridiaceae, and two species of uncertain position within the\nChytridiales. Two species of Chytriomycetaceae are described as new,\nRhizidium crepaturum and Siphonaria aurea, and Rodmanochytrium\nsphaericum is recorded for the first time from Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytridiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129306.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chytridiales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129307.phy"}]}
