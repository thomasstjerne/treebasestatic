(Goniaceae, Chlorophyta) were studied\nusing clonal cultured material originating from Fukuoka Prefecture,\nJapan. This species is similar to G. pectorale O. F. Müller and G.\nviridistellatum M. Watanabe in having one to three stable pyrenoids in\nthe chloroplasts of 8- or 16-celled vegetative colonies. However, it is\ndistinguished from G. pectorale and G. viridistellatum by the cell\narrangement of the 8-celled colonies and from G. pectorale by\naplanozygote morphology. Sexual reproduction of G. maiaprilis is\nheterothallic and isogamous, and the germinating zygote gives rise to a\nfour-cell germ colony. Phylogenetic analyses based on the plastid large\nsubunit of Rubisco genes and sequences for the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (ITS-1, 5.8S rDNA\nand ITS-2) suggest that G. maiaprilis is separate from other species of\nGonium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 21","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gonium ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6541.phy"}]}
