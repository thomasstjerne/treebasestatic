Sequences of ITS and nLSU nrRNA gene\nregions of the studied samples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses\nwere performed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and bayesian\ninference methods. The phylogenetic analyses based on molecular data of\nITS and ITS+nLSU sequences showed that S. yunnanense formed a single\nlineage with a well support (100% BS, 100% BP and 1.00 BPP), and then\ngrouped with S. furfurella and S. meridionalis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Skvortzovia Resinicium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130250.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Skvortzovia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_130251.phy"}]}
