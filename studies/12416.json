Here\nwe characterize the phylogenomic distribution of its membrane spanning\npore (MCU) and regulatory partner (MICU1). Homologs of both components\ntend to co-occur in all major branches of eukaryotic life but both have\nbeen lost along certain protozoan and fungal lineages. Several bacterial\ngenomes also contain putative MCU homologs that may represent\nprokaryotic calcium channels. The analyses indicate that the uniporter\nmay have been an early feature of mitochondria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"eukaryota 138 sp","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51126.phy"}]}
