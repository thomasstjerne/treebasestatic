However, the I+\nhymenium and amyloid ascus wall suggest affinities to families other\nthan the Thelotremataceae. To assess the identity of the genus\nIngvariella and to investigate its placement within the Ostropales, we\ninferred phylogenetic relationships of this genus based on mtSSU rDNA\nand nuLSU rDNA sequences for 60 additional species encompassing a broad\narray of ostropalean fungi by using Bayesian, maximum likelihood and\nweighted maximum parsimony methods. Here we confirm the identity of the\ngenus Ingvariella and its relationship to the family Stictidaceae,\nsister to the genus Cryptodiscus. These results expand the broad\necological diversity of the Stictidaceae, where saprotrophic fungi,\ncorticicolous lichen-forming fungi, and species that occur both as\nlichenized and non-lichenized have previously been described, being the\nfirst rock inhabiting genus. New insights into the relationships among\nthe other families within the Ostropales are also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ingvariella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_26124.phy"}]}
