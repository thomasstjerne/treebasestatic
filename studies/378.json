A simultaneous analysis of these data resulted\nin a single most-parsimonious tree that (1) places the adiastola\npicture-winged subgroup as sister taxon to the other picture-winged\nsubgroups, (2) unites the modified-tarsus species group with flies from\nthe Antopocerus species group, and (3) places the white-tip scutellum\nspecies group as the most basal taxon. Because of the different gene\nsources used in this study, numerous process partitions can be erected\nwithin this data set. We examined the incongruence among these various\npartitions and the ramifications of these data for the taxonomic\nconsensus, prior agreement, and simultaneous analysis approaches to\nphylogenetic reconstruction. Separate analyses and taxonomic consensus\nappear to be inadequate methods for dealing with the partitions in this\nstudy. Although detection of incongruence is possible and helps\nelucidate particular areas of disagreement among data sets, separation\nof partitions on the basis of incongruence is problematic for many\nreasons. First, analyzing all genes separately and then either\npresenting them all as possible hypotheses or taking their consensus\nprovides virtually no information concerning the relationships among\nthese flies. Second, despite some evidence of incongruence, there are no\nclear delineations among the various gene partitions that separate only\nheterogeneous data. Third, to the extent that problematic genes can be\nidentified, these genes have nearly the same information content, within\na combined analysis framework, as the remaining nonproblematic genes.\nOur data suggest that significant incongruence among data partitions may\nbe isolated to specific relationships and the false signal creating this\nincongruence is most likely to be overcome by a simultaneous analysis.\nWe present a new method, partitioned Bremer support, for examining the\ncontribution of a particular data partition to the topological support\nof the simultaneous analysis tree.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3293.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_585.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3282.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3291.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3295.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3283.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3284.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3292.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3285.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3294.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3e","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3288.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3d","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3286.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3h","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3287.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3f","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3289.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3g","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hawaiian Drosophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3290.phy"}]}
