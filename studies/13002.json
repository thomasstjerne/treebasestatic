It is therefore a potentially\nimportant taxon for understanding global paleobiogeographic and\nphylogenetic patterns among early sauropods. Despite its obvious\nsignificance, Rhoetosaurus has been too poorly understood to be included\ninmost recent analyses of early sauropod evolution. With this in mind,\nwe evaluated the osteology and phylogeny of undescribed materials of\nRhoetosaurus, in order to attempt to close the gap in this\nunderstanding. The lower hind limb of Rhoetosaurus highlights a plethora\nof differences from other sauropods, supporting the distinctiveness of\nRhoetosaurus even in the absence of othermaterials. Some unique traits\ninclude prominent crests and sulci on the tibia medially, a narrow\nmetatarsal articular bridge, and pedal claws with an accessory groove or\nfossa. The pes plesiomorphically retains four claws where most sauropods\nhave three, and bears superficial similarity to that of Shunosaurus.\nPreliminary cladistic analysis confirms that Rhoetosaurus is a\nnon-neosauropod gravisaurian, although weak support for the most\nparsimonious topology suggests further findings are required to improve\nupon incompleteness in the character data. Examination of alternative\nphylogenetic hypotheses rules out a close relationship between\nRhoetosaurus and East Asian Jurassic sauropods, and indicates a closer\nexamination of the potential relationships between Rhoetosaurus and\nother contemporaneous Middle Jurassic Gondwanan sauropods is\nnecessary.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55122","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55122.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55123","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55123.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55124","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55124.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55126.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55127","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55127.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55128","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55128.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55129","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55129.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55130","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55130.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55131","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55131.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55132","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 11","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55133","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55133.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 12","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55134","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55134.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 13","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55135","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55135.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 14","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55136","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55136.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 15","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55137","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55137.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 16","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55138.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 17","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55139","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55139.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 18","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55140","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55140.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 19","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55141","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55141.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 20","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55142","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55142.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 21","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55143","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55143.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 22","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 23","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 24","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55146.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 25","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55147.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55125","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55125.phy"}]}
