The phylogenies obtained were\ncontrasted with morphology of the genus. Menonvillea, excluding M.\nrollinsii, is monophyletic, but this species was sister to the genus\nCremolobus. Molecular and morphological data support the segregation of\nM. rollinsii into the new genus Aimara. Within the Menonvillea clade,\nthree strongly supported and morphologically well-defined lineages were\nobtained. Geographical distribution of Aimara and the Menonvillea\nlineages are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS MCCT","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Menonvillea ITS (DNA) Maximum clade credibility","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63073.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF GAP MP","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Menonvillea trnLF GAP strict consensus tree from\nmaximum parsimony analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63076.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF MCCT","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Menonvillea trnLF DNA Maximum clade credibility\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63075.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS GAPS MP","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Menonvillea ITS GAPS strict consensus tree from maximum\nparsimony analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63074.phy"}]}
