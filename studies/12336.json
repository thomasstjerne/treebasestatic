In New Caledonia, the genus is\nabundant and represents an important part of the reef flora. Previous\nstudies recorded 19 species identified using morphological criteria. The\naim of the present work was to reassess the genusâ€™ diversity in New\nCaledonia using morpho-anatomical examinations and molecular analyses of\nthe plastid tufA and rbcL genes. Our results suggest the occurrence of\n22 species. Three of which are reported for the first time from New\nCaledonia: H. kanaloana, H. xishaensis, and an entity resembling H.cf.\nstuposa. DNA analyses revealed that the species H. fragilis exhibit\ncryptic or pseudocryptic diversity in New Caledonia. We also show less\nconclusive evidence for cryptic species within H. taenicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ1000","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia, halimea tufa+rbcl\nconcatened","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50742.phy"},{"tree_label":"L1 NJ 1000","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50746.phy"},{"tree_label":"L2 MP 1000","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50750.phy"},{"tree_label":"L2 NJ 1000","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50749.phy"},{"tree_label":"L3 NJ1000","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50752.phy"},{"tree_label":"L4 ML100","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50757.phy"},{"tree_label":"L4 MP1000","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50756.phy"},{"tree_label":"L5 ML100","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50760.phy"},{"tree_label":"L5 NJ1000","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50758.phy"},{"tree_label":"L4 NJ1000","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50755.phy"},{"tree_label":"L2 ML100","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50751.phy"},{"tree_label":"L1 MP1000","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50748.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML100","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia, halimea tufa+rbcl\nconcatened","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50743.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP1000","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia, halimea tufa+rbcl\nconcatened","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50745.phy"},{"tree_label":"L1 ML 100","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50747.phy"},{"tree_label":"L5 MP1000","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50759.phy"},{"tree_label":"L3 MP1000","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50753.phy"},{"tree_label":"L3 ML100","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Halimeda in New Caledonia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50754.phy"}]}
