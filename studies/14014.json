However, its systematics has not been\nstudied in a comprehensive manner. Phylogenetic analyses of larger\nclades such as Nudibranchia or Cladobranchia have usually included a\npoor sample of aeolids. Furthermore, phylogenetic studies at the family\nor generic level in Aeolidida are a few and far between. The first\nmolecular phylogeny of the aeolid family Aeolidiidae is presented here.\nThis study, the most comprehensive for Aeolidida to date, uses new\nsequences of two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) genes and one nuclear genes\n(H3) for 251 specimens from members of seven families of Aeolidida\nincluding 39 species of Aeolidiidae. Excluding Pleurolidia juliae,\nAeolidiidae is monophyletic. Our results resolve the systematic\nrelationships within the Aeolidiidae at a generic level, requiring\nchanges in the systematics of this family. Spurilla, Antaeolidiella,\nLimenandra and Aeolidia are well-supported and monophyletic clades.\nAeolidiella stephanieae is transferred to Berghia and Aeolidiopsis\nransoni and Spurilla salaamica to Baeolidia, to maintain the\nmonophyletic lineages reflected in this study. The systematics of\nCerberilla remains unclear. Some species earlier attributed to\nAeolidiella are now grouped in a previously unnamed clade that we\ndesignate as Bulbaeolidia gen. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolidiidae Phylogenetic hypothesis based on the\ncombined dataset (H3+COI+16S) inferred by Bayesian analysis (BI)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62028.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolidiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62030.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolidiidae Molecular phylogeny inferred from partial\nsequences of the individual mitochondrial COI gene by Bayesian\nanalysis.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62031.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"194","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolidiidae COI ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_62033.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"174","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aeolidiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62034.phy"}]}
