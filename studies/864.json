Both SSU and ITS data sets agreed in the placement of P.\ngaudefroyi. Parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses of each data set\nplaced P. gaudefroyi within the Pleosporaceae with 100% bootstrap\nsupport. Pleospora gaudefroyi was sister taxon in the Pleosporaceae\nrepresented by Alternaria alternata, Cochliobolus sativus, Pleospora\nherbarum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Setosphaeria rostrata.\nPleospora gaudefroyi was separated from other genera in the\nPleosporaceae in 94% of the bootstrap replicates in parsimony and\nneighbor-joining analyses. When P. gaudefroyi was constrained to\nmonophyly with P. herbarum, all resulting trees were significantly worse\nthan the optimal tree in both Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa\ntests. Pleospora gaudefroyi was therefore excluded from Pleospora, and\ntransferred to the new genus Decorospora placed in the Pleosporaceae.\nDecorospora (Dothideomycetes) has characteristic ascospores enclosed in\na sheath with 4-5 apical extensions. The distribution and substrate\ntypes for D. gaudefroyi are summarized and updated based on additional\ncollections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Single most parsimonious tree, using Rhytidhysteron\nrufulum as outgroup","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4017.phy"}]}
