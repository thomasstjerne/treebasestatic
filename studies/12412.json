However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge about the\nfungal endophytes associated with these plants, which are also potential\nsources of bioactive metabolites. In this study, healthy leaves, fruit\nand root tissues of West African ebony (Diospyros crassiflora) were\nsurface-sterilized and fungal endophytes were isolated using the\nculturing method, and were examined using sequence data from the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS). A total of 176 isolates were\nrecovered and grouped into 63 morphotaxa. Overall endophytic infection\nfrequency was low (45%) but the fungal community was highly diverse.\nSequencing of 81 isolates representatively selected in all morphotaxa\nrevealed 39 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 98%\nsequence similarity. Leaves had the greatest infection frequency (59%)\nand species richness (85%). The most abundant taxa were Xylaria and\nColletotrichum. Except for a few species isolated from both leaves and\nroots, plant tissues showed species composition heterogeneity.\nAscomycetous fungi, 96% of all isolates, and mostly Sordariomycetes, 90%\nof all isolates, dominated the endophyte assemblage. One zygomycetous\nand three basidiomycetous fungi were recovered, of which Ischnoderma\nbenzoinum is herein newly reported as an endophyte. Colletotrichum\ngloeosporioides, reported as an anthracnose pathogen on D. kaki, was\nrecovered as a common foliar endophyte on D. crassiflora, suggesting its\nvariable or hemibiotrophic lifestyle on Diospyros hosts. Therefore, this\nfinding has important biocontrol implications, as some co-isolated\nendophytes may be useful as biocontrol agents for Colletotrichum\nanthracnose of D. kaki.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51134","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51134.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51135","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51135.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51136","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51136.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51137","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51137.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51138","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51138.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51139","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51139.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51140","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51140.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51141","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51141.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51142","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51142.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51143","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51143.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51144.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51145","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51145.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51146","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51146.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51147","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51147.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51148","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51148.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51149","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51149.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51150.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51151","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51151.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51152.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51153.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51154","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51154.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51155","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51155.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51156","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51156.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51157","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51157.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51158","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51158.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51159","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51159.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51160","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51160.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51161","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51161.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"145","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr51162","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_51162.phy"}]}
