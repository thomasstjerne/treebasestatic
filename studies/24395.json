Suitability of the rust fungus Puccinia rapipes as a\nclassical biological control agent for Lycium ferocissimum (African\nboxthorn) in Australia was assessed using a streamlined agent selection\nframework . Studies with P. rapipes were undertaken to elucidate its\nlife cycle, confirm its taxonomic placement and determine its\npathogenicity to L. ferocissimum and seven closely related Solanaceae\nspecies that occur in Australia. Field surveys in the native range of\nSouth Africa, experiments in a containment facility in Australia and DNA\nsequencing confirmed that P. rapipes is macrocyclic and autoecious,\nproducing all five spore stages on L. ferocissimum. The stages not\npreviously encountered, spermogonia and aecia, are described. Sequencing\nalso confirmed that P. rapipes is sister to Puccinia afra in the ‘Old\nWorld Lineage’ of Puccinia species on Lycieae. Two purified isolates of\nthe fungus, representing the Eastern and Western Cape distributions of\nP. rapipes in South Africa, were cultured in the containment facility\nfor use in pathogenicity testing. Lycium ferocissimum and all of the\nLycium species of Eurasian origin tested ‒ L. barbarum (goji berry), L.\nchinense (goji berry ‘chinense’) and L. ruthenicum (black goji berry) \nwere susceptible to both isolates of P. rapipes. The Australian native\nLycium australe and three more distantly related species in different\ngenera tested were resistant to both isolates. The isolate from the\nWestern Cape was significantly more pathogenic on L. ferocissimum than\nthe Eastern Cape isolate. Our results indicate that P. rapipes may be\nsufficiently host specific to pursue as a biological control agent in an\nAustralian context, should regulators be willing to accept damage to the\nEurasian goji berries being cultivated, albeit to a limited extent, in\nAustralia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117263","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117263.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117554","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117554.phy"}]}
