At least seven Inonotus sensu stricto species were\nrecorded for the region. These are I. ochroporus, I. patouillardii, I.\npertenuis, I. quercustris, I. rickii, I. serranus and I. texanus. A\ndetailed description of each species is given, and a key for their\nidentification is provided. Each morphospecies could also be\ndistinguished from both RFLPs and sequence data obtained from PCR\nproducts of the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear\nribosomal RNA gene (ITS). A high level of nucleotide sequence variation\nwas found among Inonotus. Molecular data also indicate that one\nmorphospecies, I. patouillardii, may in fact represent two distinct\nspecies. Both cultural and molecular data support the view that\nPtychogaster cubensis represents an anamorphic state of I. rickii. Two\nnew combinations are proposed, namely Phellinus crustosus and Inocutis\njamaicensis. I. pertenuis is reported for the first time from\nArgentina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inonotus s. l. in Argentina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5695.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 lineage 1","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inonotus s. l. in Argentina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5696.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 left","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inonotus s. l. in Argentina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5694.phy"}]}
