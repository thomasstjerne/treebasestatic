These two sections share\nmorphological characters and have been thought to be closely related.\nThe purpose of this study is to test whether the two sections are\nmonophyletic as well as whether they form sister clades. Our results\nindicate that the two sections do not form sister clades, and that\nsection Gymnobythus is monophyletic but Whitlavia is not. The members of\nWhitlavia form two clades, one of which is sister to a clade that\ncontains section Gymnobythus. The data indicate hybridization or a\nrecent divergence between Phacelia parryi and Phacelia minor, as well as\na close alliance between Phacelia longipes and Phacelia\ncampanularia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phacelia sects.
