The taxon is\ncharacterized by the lacrimal perpendicular to the ventral margin of the\nupper jaw, which is similar to that of Thecodontosaurus; a\ndepression present on the dorsal profile of the snout behind the naris;\nthe rostral profile of the maxilla slopes continuously towards the\nrostral tip; and the presence of 25 dentary teeth. It also displays\nprosauropod characters such as a relatively long skull, the slope of the\nmaxillary rostral profile, and teeth that do not have basically\nconstricted crowns. The new specimen is more basal than Anchisaurus and\nrepresents the first basal sauropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of\nChina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Sauropodomorpha results","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55680.phy"}]}
