The fungus, a sexual morph, was isolated using the single\nspore isolation technique. The morphology is illustrated and a\ndescription has been provided. Sequence data of the LSU and ITS gene\nregions were analysed to confirm the phylogenetic placement of the\nspecies. The history of P. trichostoma, its distribution and economic\nimpact as a pathogen that causes leaf spots on cereals and wheat, has\nbeen discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129674.phy"}]}
