We examined type and reference materials of C.\nstuckertiana and increased the sampling of DNA sequences to solve the\ntaxonomic status of C. stuckertiana. A multi-gene phylogenetic\nreconstruction based on nuclear (28S, ITS) and codifying (Tef 1-α)\nmolecular markers showed that the specimens previously determined as C.\nstuckertiana clustered in three independent not closely related\nlineages, within Phylloporia. As a result of these analyses, Phylloporia\nstuckertiana comb. nov. and two new south American stipitate species are\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenochaetaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107985.phy"}]}
