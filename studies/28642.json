During an experimental survey aimed\nto isolate fungal species contributing to the biodeterioration of the\nlimestone walls of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra (Portuguese UNESCO World\nHeritage site), a Talaromyces species that could not be identified to\nany currently known species in this genus was isolated. Molecular\nphylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS),\nβ-tubulin (BenA) and RNA polymerase II subunit 2 (rpb2), placed this\nfungus in Talaromyces sect. Purpurei, while also pointing its\nphylogenetic distinction from the remaining species in this section.\nThus, a novel species, Talaromyces saxoxalicus sp. nov., is here\nproposed. Moreover, considering the isolation source of this fungus and\nin an attempt to understand its contribution to the overall stone\nmonument biodeterioration, the species in vitro biodeteriorative\npotential was also evaluated. The results highlighted that the species\nexhibited an in vitro biodeteriorative ability (calcium oxalate crystal\nformation), highlighting its potential deteriorative profile.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133964","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133964.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 gene Final Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134333","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134333.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Final Analysis Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133965.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134330.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 gene Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133968.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Final Analysis Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134334","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134334.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134331","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134331.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Final Analysis Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134332","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134332.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 gene Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134335","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134335.phy"},{"tree_label":"3 gene Final Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133969","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133969.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Final RAXML Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133966.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA Final Analysis Bayes Tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133967.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST BenA BAYES Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134337","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134337.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST BenA RAXML Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134340.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST 3 BAYES Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134336","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134336.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST 3 RAXML Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134338","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134338.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST ITS RAXML Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134339.phy"},{"tree_label":"LAST ITS BAYES Tree","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134341","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134341.phy"}]}
