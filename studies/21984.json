In preliminary analyses based on ITS, strains of these\nspecies appear basal in Colletotrichum phylogenies, clustering close to\nC. cliviae, C. brevisporum and other recently described species from\ntropical or subtropical regions. Phylogenetic analyses (ITS, GAPDH,\nCHS-1, HIS3, ACT, TUB2) of 102 strains previously identified as Ga.\nglycines, C. magnum and C. orchidearum as well as other related strains\nfrom different culture collections and studies placed these taxa in\nthree species complexes, and distinguished at least 24 species,\nincluding 11 new species. In this study, C. magnum, C. orchidearum and\nC. piperis were epitypified and their taxonomy resolved, while C.\ncliviicola was proposed as a new name for C. cliviae. Furthermore, a\nsexual morph was observed for C. yunnanense, while C. brevisporum, C.\ncliviicola and C. tropicicola were reported from new hosts or countries.\nRegarding their conidial morphology, species in the C. dracaenophilum,\nC. magnum and C. orchidearum species complexes are reminiscent of C.\ngloeosporioides or C. boninense s. lat., and were likely to be confused\nwith them in the past.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112663.phy"}]}
