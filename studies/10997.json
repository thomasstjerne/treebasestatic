Based on\nmorphological and cytochrome b DNA sequence data presented here, we\npropose a new subgenus, Megapomys, to include the large-bodied members\nof the genus, which form a monophyletic unit of relatively large mice\n(averaging ca. 65 to 110 g) with tails about as long as or slightly\nshorter than the length of the head and body, all of which forage on the\nground. Other members of the genus are assigned to the subgenus Apomys;\nthey are smaller (ca. 18 to 41 g), have long tails, and usually or often\nforage above ground. Members of the subgenus Megapomys include four\npreviously recognized species and the seven described here. All occur in\nnorthern and central Luzon Island, with the exception of one species\nthat occurs on Mindoro Island; none are present in southern Luzon. Each\nspecies may be distinguished both morphologically and genetically. There\nare few records of Megapomys below 500 m elevation, and some species\noccur near the peak of the highest mountain on Luzon (i.e., up to ca.\n2800 m). On four mountain ranges, two species of the subgenus co-occur,\none at lower and one at higher elevations, though there is usually some\nsyntopic overlap. Sister-species usually occur allopatrically in\ndifferent mountain ranges, but there is one exception. Some of these\nspecies occur in areas not previously known to support endemic mammals,\nindicating that these areas are previously unrecognized areas of\nmammalian endemism where further study is warranted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25584.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25572.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25578.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25577.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25579.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25585.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25573.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25574.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25576.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25581.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25583.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25575.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25580.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seven New Species of Large-bodied Apomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25582.phy"}]}
