Lilaceae; four newly recorded taxa are fully\ndescribed and illustrated. The new variety found in this study, L.\nfraterna var. thailandica, is compared with L. fraterna var. fraterna\nfrom Papua New Guinea. Lepiota fraterna var. thailandica differs in that\nthe basidiospores and cheilocystidia are larger. Lepiota cristata var.\nmacrospora (Lepiota fraterna var. macrospora Zhu L. Yang) from China is\nagain similar to L. fraterna var. thailandica in spore morphology.\nHowever, its basidiomata are bigger, and these taxa also differ in their\nITS sequences, identified from material gathered in Thailand. In\naddition, another species was collected; L. ochraceofulva is a rare\nspecies and a new record for Southeast Asia, and the other two taxa\n(Lepiota sp. 1 and Lepiota sp. 2) are not identified to species in this\npaper as both are only known from two small specimens or one\nsolitary","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
