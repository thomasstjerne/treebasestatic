The disease affects human,\ndomestic animals and wildlife. However, leptospirosis is challenging in\nits diagnosis in humans. Culture technique, which is time consuming, is\nnot recommended for clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in humans. For\nthese reasons, serological and molecular techniques remain the test of\nchoice. The major objective of this study was to explore the genetic\ncharacteristic of Leptospira species which are prevalent among\nagro-pastoralists living in KataviÂ–Rukwa Ecosystem, Tanzania.","trees":[{"tree_label":"new","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95606.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95608","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95608.phy"}]}
