Here we aim to clarify the biogeography and\nphylogeographical relationships of this poorly documented region. We\nconducted molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses, using\nmitochondrial genes (ND4 and cyt-b). Our analyses suggest that\ndivergence events among the three extant species, and among major\nlineages within those species, are congruent with Plio-pleistocene\nclimatic variations. Two highly divergent genetic lineages within D.\ncoronoides occur in Tasmania. Molecular dating suggests that these\nlineages were isolated from the mainland in the Pleistocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr7807","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_7807.phy"}]}
