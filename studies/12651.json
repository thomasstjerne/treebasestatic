They differ, however, in their\necology, with the former being plant pathogenic, while Heteroconium\ns.str. is a genus of sooty moulds. Results of molecular analyses\ninferred from DNA sequences of the large subunit (LSU) and internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS) region of nrDNA, delineated four\nHeteroconium-like species on Eucalyptus, namely H. eucalypti, H.\nkleinziense, Alysidiella parasitica, and one isolate resembling a novel\nspecies in a clade separate from the holotype of Heteroconium, H.\ncitharexyli. Based on molecular phylogeny, morphology and ecology, the\nHeteroconium-like species associated with Chocolate Spot disease are\nreclassified in the genus Alysidiella, which is shown to have mycelium\nthat is immersed in and superficial on the host tissue, conidiogenous\ncells that can have loci that are either inconspicuous, or proliferating\npercurrently. Furthermore, conidiogenous cells can either occur solitary\non hyphae, or be sporodochial, arranged on a weakly developed stroma,\nwhich further distinguishes Alysidiella from Heteroconium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr52496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_52496.phy"}]}
