Morphological characteristics of these\ncultures were described and compared with type specimens and the\noriginal descriptions. Based on phylogeny inferred from ITS and\nmulti-locus alignments, traditionally defined P. ampelicida (teleomoph\nknown as Guignardia bidwellii) is revealed to be a species complex\nincluding P. ampelicida sensu stricto typified in this study and another\ntwo species. Phyllosticta parthenocissi is described as a new species.\nOur results denied the teleomorph/anamorph connection between P.\nvaccinii and G. vaccinii, as they represent different species.\nMulti-locus sequence data from the neotype and epitype were generated\nand deposited in GenBank.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta ampelicida and P. vaccinii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69179.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta ampelicida and P. vaccinii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69186.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta ampelicida and P. vaccinii 56x704 NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69187.phy"}]}
