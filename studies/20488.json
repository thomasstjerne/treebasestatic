In this study, 22 vineyards located in\nseven provinces of China were surveyed. Trunk and shoot dieback were\nconsistently observed, the most severe damage being due to trunk\ndieback. From the 175 Diaporthe isolates obtained, seven species of\nDiaporthe were identified by means of phenotypic characteristics and\nphylogenetic analysis of combined internal transcribed spacer (ITS),\nelongation factor-1α (EF-1α), β-tubulin and calmodulin (CAL) gene\nregions. Two species new to science, Diaporthe guangxiensis and D.\nhubeiensis, were isolated from Guangxi and Hubei Provinces,\nrespectively. The predominant species was Diaporthe eres (75), which\naccounted for 42.8 % of collections, whereas D. guangxiensis (29), D.\ngulyae (5), D. hubeiensis (32), D. pescicola (2), D. sojae (24) and D.\nunshiuensis (8) were identified as being associated with dieback\nsymptoms. With the exception of D. eres and D. sojae, the other species\nrecorded in this study were found to be associated with grapevine\ndieback for the first time. Most of the species isolated were\ndistributed throughout the regions surveyed. Isolates of all species\nwere able to cause typical dieback symptoms in grapevine shoots after\ninoculation, but the most severe symptoms were caused by D. gulyae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe grapevine dieback MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105707.phy"}]}
