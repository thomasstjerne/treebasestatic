Amphipilosae is described as a new\nsection to give formal recognition to a strongly supported clade that\nwas revealed by a recent molecular systematic study. The five known\nspecies are restricted to the arid western parts of southern Africa (C.\ncolorata, C. excisa, C. humilis, C. meyeriana, and C. pearsonii).\nSpecies of the section are morphologically distinct in having (1) hairs\ndistributed all around the distal part of the style; (2) ridge\ncallosities on the standard petal blade and claw; (3) a rounded keel;\n(4) a twisted keel beak; (5) a rounded style. A cladistic analysis of 21\nmorphological characters resulted in a well-resolved cladogram showing\nrelationships within the section. The study revealed that two new\nspecies should be recognised, which are here described as C. giessii and\nC. kolbergii. A taxonomic revision of the section is presented, with\ndescriptions, diagnostic characters, distribution maps, and\nillustrations of all seven species recognised.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crotalaria section Amphipilosae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58081.phy"}]}
