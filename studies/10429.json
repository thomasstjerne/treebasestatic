Our\nresults indicate sect. Bartonia is monophyletic and consists of two\nwellsupported, species-rich clades. One of these two deepest clades\nconsists of the Great Plains M. decapetala and a group of species\ncentered in the North American intermountain region that have been\ndescribed as subshrubby; whereas, the second deepest clade is more\nwidespread and includes taxa from the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts as\nwell as the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and intermountain region.\nHypothesis tests applying the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test and Bayes\nfactors (BF) rejected unequivocally the monophyly of (1) the\n‘subshrubby’ group, suggesting multiple origins of the ‘subshrubby’\nform; (2) M . multicaulis s. l., which consists of disparate clades we\npropose as separate species; and (3) M . multiflora s. l., which was\nrecovered as highly polyphyletic. Hypothesis tests were equivocal,\nhowever, in regard to the monophyly of (1) M . marginata , M.\nparadoxensis , and M . cronquistii ; (2) M . oreophila s. l.; and (3) M.\npumila s. l. We suggest following narrow taxonomic approaches to the\ncircumscriptions of M . multicaulis , M . multiflora , and M. pumila and\nadvocate further studies of M . oreophila and the complex including of M\n. marginata , M. paradoxensis , and M . cronquistii . Our results\nprovide the most comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis of sect. Bartonia\nto date, however, more variable markers will be needed to resolve a well\nsupported phylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS ETS Tree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mentzelia Section Bartonia","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_20078.phy"}]}
