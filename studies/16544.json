In P.\nvulgaris, two different DNA hybridization patterns were found, giving\nfurther evidence for two major gene pools in that species. The\nrestriction patterns of P. vulgaris var. aborigineus, the putative\nancestral form of P. vuIgaris, exhibit clear homology to P. vulgaris\ngenotypes. An undefined landrace from Taiwan could be identified as a P.\nvulgaris genotype. RFLP-based trees for the phytohemagglutinin genes of\nthe species studied were computed with several distance matrix and\nparsimony methods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RFLP-based phenograms of the PHA genes for the\nPhaseolus and Vigna genotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78572.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RFLP-based phenograms of the PHA genes for the\nPhaseolus and Vigna genotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RFLP-based phenograms of the PHA genes for the\nPhaseolus and Vigna genotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78574.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RFLP-based phenograms of the PHA genes for the\nPhaseolus and Vigna genotypes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_78573.phy"}]}
