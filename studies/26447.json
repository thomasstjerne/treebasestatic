Its\nTricholomatoid basidiocarp and brightly colored pileus are typical\ncharacteristics of the genus Calocybe. However, the generic position has\nbeen often doubted since C. indica was isolated from the other members\nof the genus in earlier molecular studies. In the present study, the\nnatural taxonomic position of C. indica was reconsidered based on the\nmolecular phylogenetic analyses using nrITS ribosomal sequences. Our\nresult showed that samples of C. indica are separated from the other\nCalocybe spp., but tightly clustered with Macrocybe spp. with strong\nbootstrap supports. Based on the phylogenetic evidence, a new\ncombination Macrocybe indica was proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129546","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129546.phy"}]}
