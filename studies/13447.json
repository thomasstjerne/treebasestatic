Such carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) are\nhypothesized to have evolved during periods of low atmospheric CO2.\nHornworts, the sister to vascular plants, have a CCM that relies on\npyrenoids, proteinaceous bodies mostly consisting of RuBisCO. We\ngenerated a phylogeny based on mitochondrial and plastid sequences for\n36% of the c.Â 200 hornwort species to infer the history of gains and\nlosses of pyrenoids in this clade; we also used fossils and multiple\ndating approaches to generate a chronogram for the hornworts. The\nresults imply 5-6 origins and an equal number of subsequent losses of\npyrenoids in hornworts, with the oldest pyrenoid gained ca. 100 mya, and\nmost others at <35 mya. The non-synchronous appearance of\npyrenoid-containing clades, the successful diversification of\npyrenoid-lacking clades during periods with low CO2, and the maintenance\nof pyrenoids during episodes of high [CO2] all argue against the\npreviously proposed relationship between pyrenoid origin and low [CO2].\nThe selective advantages, and costs, of hornwort pyrenoids thus must\nrelate to additional factors besides atmospheric CO2.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57646","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57646.phy"}]}
