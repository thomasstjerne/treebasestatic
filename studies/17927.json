The morphology of specimens derived from cultures grown under\ndifferent conditions and from natural substrata was compared. DNA\nsequence data of ITS regions within nuclear rDNA supported the\nmorphological species concept and indicated that Thozetella species are\nanamorphs of the ascomycete genus Chaetosphaeria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chaetosphaeria and Thozetella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89022.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thozetella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89021.phy"}]}
