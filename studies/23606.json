We collected 14 larva and pupae of Aedes\nfrom urban households in Rivera City, northern Uruguay, to obtain DNA\nsequences of the mitochondrial ND4 gene. Our results confirmed that our\nsamples belong to Ae. aegypti. In addition, the two haplotypes found are\ncommon worldwide or in the Americas, including Argentina and Brazil.\nHowever, the limited availability of ND4 sequences from Argentina and\nsouthern Brazilian states, and the widespread geographic distribution of\nthese haplotypes, do not allow ruling out several potential routes of\ncolonization of northern Uruguay.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"651","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aedes aegypti ND4 Uruguay","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114787.phy"}]}
