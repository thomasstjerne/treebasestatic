In this study, samples of microfungi were\ncollected from symptomatic branches, stem and leaves of different\nmangrove species (Xylocarpus granarum, X. moluccensis and Lumnitzera\nracemosa) and examined morphologically. In addition, a combined\nmulti-gene DNA sequence dataset (ITS, LSU, ACT and RPB2) was analysed to\ninvestigate phylogenetic relationships and help in a more reliable\nspecies identification. Two new species, Cytospora thailandica sp. nov.\nand C. lumnitzericola sp. nov. are introduced herein, while one specimen\nof C. rhizophorae is described and designated as a reference specimen.\nThe phylogeny recovered supports our morphological data to introduce two\nnew species to the genus Cytospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112344","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112344.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112427","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112427.phy"}]}
