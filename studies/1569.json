The new species\nis morphologically distinguished from the similar species P. karstenii\nin having unbranched and short apical appendages, from P. heteroconis in\nthe absence of basal appendages, and from P. westerdijkii in the\ndifferent median cell colour and absent basal appendage. Furthermore,\nthis new species has a large conidium length/width ratio. Phylogenetic\nanalysis based on ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) and beta-tubulin 2\ngene (tub2) indicated that P. hainanensis is different from P.\nkarstenii, P. heteroconis and P. westerdijkii. It is suggested that when\na new Pestalotiopsis species is described, both of morphological\ncharacters and molecular phylogenetic information are necessary to prove\nthe new taxon is unique from other known species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2512.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Beta-Tub","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2513.phy"}]}
