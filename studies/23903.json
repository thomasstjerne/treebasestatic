To revaluate and delimit the genus Conidiobolus,\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed using the large subunit\nof nuclear ribosomal RNA (nucLSU), the small subunit of nuclear\nribosomal RNA (nucSSU), the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosomal\nRNA (mtSSU) and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α). The\nresult conformed that the Conidiobolus is not monophyletic, being\ngrouped into four clades, with a recovered genus Delacroixia and three\nnew genera Microconidiobolus, Capillidium, and Neoconidiobolus.\nConsequently, several new combinations were proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115643","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115643.phy"}]}
