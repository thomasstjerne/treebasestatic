Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph:\nChalara fraxinea) is an invasive and highly destructive fungal pathogen\nfound on common ash Fraxinus excelsior in Europe and is native to East\nAsia. To gain insights into its dispersal mechanisms and history of\ninvasion, we used microsatellite markers and characterized the genetic\nstructure and diversity of H. pseudoalbidus populations at three spatial\nlevels: (i) between Europe and Japan; (ii) in Europe and (iii) at the\nepidemicâs front in Switzerland. Phylogenetic and network analysis\ndemonstrated that individuals from both regions are conspecific.\nHowever, populations from Japan harbored a higher genetic diversity and\nwere genetically differentiated from European ones. No evident\npopulation structure was found among the 1208 European strains using\nBayesian and multivariate clustering analysis. Only the distribution of\ngenetic diversity in space, pairwise population differentiation (GST)\nand the spatial analysis of principal components revealed a faint\ngeographic pattern around Europe. A significant allele deficiency in\nmost European populations pointed to a recent genetic bottleneck,\nwhereas no pattern of isolation by distance was found . Our data suggest\nthat H. pseudoalbidus was introduced just once by at least two\nindividuals. The potential source region of H. pseudoalbidus is vast and\nfurther investigations are required for a more accurate localization of\nthe source population.","trees":[{"tree_label":"EF1alpha BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus EF1a consensus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70752.phy"},{"tree_label":"Actin BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Actin consensus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70747.phy"},{"tree_label":"Actin MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Actin consensus ML2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70748.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus ITS consensus BI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70754.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1alpha MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus EF1a consensus ML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70751.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus ITS consensus ML1","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70753.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenate MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Concatenate consensus\nML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70755.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concatenate BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Cocatenate consensus\nBI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70756.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calmodulin BI","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Calmodulin consensus\nBI","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70750.phy"},{"tree_label":"Calmodulin MLT","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus Calmodulin consensus\nML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_70749.phy"}]}
