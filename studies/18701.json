Fomitiporia subhippophaëicola is diagnostic by\neffused-reflexed to pileate basidiomata, angular pores (810 per mm),\nthick-walled generative hyphae, subglobose to obovoid basidiospores (68\n× 5.57 μm), and presence of ventricose to fusoid cystidioles.\nPhylogenetic analysis inferred from combined sequences including the nuc\nrDNA ITS1-5.8-ITS2 region, 28S rDNA D1-D2 domains, partial sequences of\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α, and RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunits genes indicated that F. norbulingka and F. subhippophaëicola\nrepresent two new lineages which group together with F.\nhippophaëicola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitiporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118318.phy"}]}
