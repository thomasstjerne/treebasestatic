Partial COI data indicate the\npossibility of the early divergence in the D. pyri  D. reaumuri stem,\nwhich might have occurred even before the splitting of the common\nancestral species of D. reaumuri  D. plantaginea complex. Such a\nconclusion seems to be compatible with the available data on the host\nspecificity, life cycles and distribution of both species. The\nintroductory phylogenetic analysis based on partial COI and EF-1α\nsequences indicate the need for reconsideration of the subgeneric\nstructure in the genus Dysaphis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-COI-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52552.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-COI-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52553.phy"},{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-EF1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52556.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-COI-ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52554.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-EF1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52555.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dysaphis-EF1alpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52557.phy"}]}
