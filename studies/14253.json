The genus is\ndivided into about 160 subgenera, the validity of a vast majority of\nwhich has never been verified using cladistic methods. This paper deals\nwith the mainly Palaearctic subgenus Heteronychia Brauer &\nBergenstamm, which comprises 89 species and is thus the largest subunit\nof Sarcophaga. We performed a cladistic analysis of the group based\nexclusively on male morphological characters. Parsimony analyses were\nrun on a matrix of 84 characters for 88 species. Species of the\nsubgenera Discachaeta Enderlein and Notoecus Stein were also included in\nthe matrix. A further analysis was carried out using a subset of\ncharacters from the terminalia alone (70 characters). The results show\nthat the clade formed by Heteronychia, Discachaeta, and Notoecus is\nmonophyletic, with Discachaeta emerging as polyphyletic whereas\nSarcophaga (Notoecus) longestylata Strobl is nested within the\nSarcophaga filia-group. Character states supporting Heteronychia and the\nfew well-supported species-groups are discussed in detail. The following\nsynonymies are proposed: Discachaeta = Heteronychia (syn. nov.) and\nNotoecus = Heteronychia (syn. nov.). The paper also includes a\nhistorical background of the taxon in relation to the classfication of\nthe genus Sarcophaga over the past two centuries, as well as a\nterminological review of the male terminalia, particularly of the\ndistiphallus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63593.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63592.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63599.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63600.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63601.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63594.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63595.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63596.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63597.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63598.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Heteronychia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63602.phy"}]}
