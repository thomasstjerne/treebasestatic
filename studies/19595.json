Geographic\nvariations in ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 regions of these frequently occurring\nspecies were analyzed in this study. Sequences obtained from basidioms\noriginated from different forest habitats in two distinctive parts of\ncentral Serbia (Mts Tara and Stara planina) were compared with sequences\ndownloaded from publicly available NCBI and UNITE databases. The highest\nintraspecific variation within ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 region was observed in\nH. radicata (5,9%) while sequences of P. varius and F. pinicola showed\nlower variability (3,9 and 3,4% respectively). Our results indicate that\nvariability of ITS sequences are primarily dependent of fungal species\nand is generally lower within populations when compared with\nmetapopulation variability. It was also determined that fungal species\nfrom wide geographic localities are genetically differentiated,\nindicating that ITS is suitable for phylogeographic investigation of the\nspecies F. pinicola, P. varius and H. radicata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"P varius","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus varius ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97403.phy"},{"tree_label":"H radicata","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hymenopellis radicata ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97404.phy"},{"tree_label":"F pinicola","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fomitopsis pinicola ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97402.phy"}]}
