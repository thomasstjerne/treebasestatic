{"Authors":" Miao Liu, James A Kolmer","Year":" 2011","Title":" Development of SNP markers to infer evolutionary\nrelationships of Puccinia triticina","Journal":" Molecular Ecology Resources","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Single-nucleotide polymorphism, leaf rust, population,\nevolution, house-keeping genes, simple sequence repeats","DOI":"","Abstract":" A panel of sixteen Puccinia triticina isolates selected\nfrom worldwide populations from common and durum wheat were examined for\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism in the intron regions of three house\nkeeping genes, elongation factor 1 (EF1-α), RNA polymerase II largest\nsubunit (RPB1) and the RNA polymerase II 2nd largest unit (RPB2) and\nflanking regions of simple sequence repeats (SSR). An in silico approach\nwas also adopted to select SNPs based on the comparison of random\nanonymous regions of sequences from four P. triticina genomes. The in\nsilico approach examining random anonymous regions proved more efficient\nfor finding SNPs than in the targeted loci. In total, fifteen pairs of\nprimers were designed for three house keeping genes (five pairs for\nEF1-α, three for RPB1, and seven for RPB2), 32 pairs for 16 SSR loci,\nand 17 for anonymous regions. After initial testing for success of PCR\namplification, one region for each house keeping gene, seven SSR\nflanking regions and nine anonymous regions were selected for further\nevaluation for SNPs. A total of 146 SNP sites were obtained: seven from\nthree house-keeping genes, 42 from seven SSR flanking regions and 97\nsites were from nine anonymous regions. Based on the value of nucleotide\ndiversity (Pi), the anonymous regions were more variable compared to\nother regions. Neutrality tests indicate all loci were not under strong\nselection. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis of 16 P. triticina\nisolates based on 146 SNP sites generally separated isolates from common\nwheat from those on durum wheat as a distinct clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48934","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48934.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48935.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48936","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48936.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48937","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48937.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48938","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48938.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48939","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48939.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48940","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48940.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48941","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48941.phy"}]}
