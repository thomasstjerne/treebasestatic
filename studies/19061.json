Sequence analysis of the internal\ntranscribed spacer regions (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA from the\nisolated fungi revealed the presence of a single, unique phylotype in\neach site belonging to the genus Coprinellus in the family\nPsathyrellaceae. One of the isolates produced fruiting bodies and was\nidentified as C. domesticus on the basis of macro-and microcharacters of\nthe basidiomata and sequence data of ITS. The same species also\nassociated with the leafy, partially mycoheterotrophic Cremastra\nvariabilis, a close relative of Cr. aphylla, among its various\nmycobionts. We found that the evolution from partial to full\nmycoheterotrophy in the genus Cremastra does not associate a complete\nshift in fungal partners, but rather that a full mycoheterotrophic\norchid species maintains associations with the same mycobionts as its\nrelated partial mycoheterotrophic species. These results suggest that\nfungal partners do not necessarily shift but are rather selected for in\nthe course of the evolution of mycoheterotrophy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllamycobionts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97392.phy"}]}
