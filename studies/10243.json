Similar isolates to one of these species were\nalso collected in the Western Cape from Protea infructescences. These\nstrains were compared morphologically to known species of Penicillium,\nbut could not be identified using previously published keys.\nMorphologically, these strains belong to the subgenus Biverticillium.\nThey are distinguished by strongly funiculose colonies covered by\nglutinous exudates and conidiophores having thin acerose phialides\n(8.510[12] × 2.02.5 μm) giving rise to chains of subspheroid to\nellipsoidal conidia (2.53.0 × 1.52.5 μm). Characteristically short\n(100150[250] μm) determinate synnema are produced in culture after\nprolonged incubation with much longer synnema produced in nature. Based\non differences in morphology and molecular characters, the strains are\ndescribed here as Penicillium ramulosum sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Beta Tubulin","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6721.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6903.phy"}]}
