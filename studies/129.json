Molecular evidence supports the removal of\nPsilactis from Machaeranthera and its alliance with Aster. Within the\nAster lineage, chloroplast DNA data support an alliance composed of\nmembers of Psilactis that have n = 4 (P. tenuis, P. boltoniae) and those\nof Aster subg. Oxytripolium that are based on x = 5 (A. subulatus, A.\ntenuifolius), separating them from the n = 9 species of both Aster and\nPsilactis. Evidence from nuclear rDNA, in contrast, supports different\nalignments by combining n = 4 and n = 9 species of Psilactis and by\nallying the n = 5 and n = 10 species of Aster subg. Oxytripolium with\nother species of Aster. Comparison of cpDNA results with evidence from\nmorphology, rDNA, and isozymes suggests that hybridization may account\nfor some relationships supported by chloroplast DNA. Psilactis is\nre-established as a distinct genus of six species, with P. mexicana\nplaced in synonymy under P. gentryi. The following new taxonomic\ncombinations are made: Psilactis gentryi, Psilactis odysseus, and\nPsilactis heterocarpa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psilactis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1558.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psilactis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1559.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psilactis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1560.phy"}]}
