This new theropod exhibits\ncharacteristics of maniraptorans (i.e., coelurosaurians more derived\nthan tyrannosaurids) including an upturned rostral process of the\npostorbital, the caudoventral corner of which is widely concave.\nFurthermore, teeth without denticles and carina in the mesial margin\nresemble the condition of the maniraptoran clades Compsognathidae and\nDeinonychosauria. The new Patagonian theropod differs from other\ncoelurosaurians (Ornithomimosauria, Compsognathidae, Alvarezsauridae,\nDromaeosauridae, Aves) in having caudal vertebrae with a single pair of\nsmall pleurocoels on each side, and in having a median depression\nflanked by two longitudinal and narrow furrows on each tooth. Orkoraptor\nrepresents one of the southernmost carnivorous dinosaurs yet found in\nSouth America and adds valuable information about the diversification of\ntetanuran theropods in Gondwana.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 8 phylogeny","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coelurosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56101.phy"}]}
