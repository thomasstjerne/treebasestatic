This includes\nflowers that are salverform, tubular, or infundibuliform, white, yellow,\npink, purple, and red, and with or without corolla spurs. Previous\nclassifications of Achimenes have relied heavily on floral form as a\nmeasure of relationship. This study explores phylogenetic relationships\nin Achimenes and addresses questions of proper supraspecific\nclassification, evolution of floral forms and pollination syndromes, the\norigins of floral spurs, chromosome evolution, and biogeographic\npatterns using nrDNA ITS and cpDNA trnL-F spacer sequences analyzed\nusing maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methodologies.\nPhylogenetic hypotheses support the non-monophyly of most of the\nsupraspecific classification units currently recognized in Achimenes,\nmultiple origins of each of the pollination syndromes and the major\nmorphological characteristics used to define these syndromes, multiple\norigins of floral spurs, multiple tetraploid events, and sympatric\ndistributions of many closely related species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achimenes tnnL-F tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1229.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achimenes ITS tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1228.phy"}]}
