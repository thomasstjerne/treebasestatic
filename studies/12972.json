In this study, the\nidentity and pathogenicity of non-Botryosphaeriaceae fungal species\nconsistently recovered from necrotic tissues of branch and bleeding\ntrunk canker samples from these areas were assessed. Species were\nidentified morphologically and by comparison of the complete sequence of\nthe internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rDNA to other isolate\nsequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using ITS and\npartial sequences of the ÃŸ-tubulin and mitochondrial small ribosomal\nsubunit (SSU) genes for unknown species. Fusarium solani,\nPhaeoacremonium mortoniae, and Diatrypella verrucaeformis were\nidentified and results support the erection of a new species, described\nherein as Cryptosporiopsis polymorpha sp.nov. One-year-old coast live\noak seedlings were wound inoculated under controlled conditions to test\npathogenicity of these species. Each fungal species was successfully\nre-isolated and represent new records of fungal pathogens of coast live\noak in California. Isolates of F. solani were the most aggressive\ntested. Results from the pathogenicity test suggest that along with\nBotryosphaeriaceae species, these fungi play a role in the decline of\nsouthern Californian coast live oaks.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypella ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64306.phy"}]}
