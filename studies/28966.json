In this\nstudy, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses based on nuc rDNA\ninternal transcribed spacer region (ITS) + nuc 28S rDNA (nrLSU) and a\nsix genes [ITS, LSU, RNA polymerase II largest subunit (RPB1), RNA\npolymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), 18S nuclear small subunit\nribosomal DNA (nrSSU), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF)]\ndataset using Bayesian (BA) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods showed\nthat the species of Asproinocybe and Tricholosporum form an independent\nfamily-level clade (BPP=0.98, BS=72). Asproinocybaceae fam. nov., a new\nfamily is established here for accommodating this clade. Two new species\nAsproinocybe sinensis and Tricholosporum guangxiense from subtropical\nkarst areas of China also describe here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134346","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134346.phy"}]}
