Deconica milvispora from a warm\ntemperate rainforest of Australia is characterized by the rhomboid with\nnodulose angles basidiospores not observed in any member of the genus\nuntil now. Deconica esperanzae from a cloud forest in the south of\nMexico is characterized by subrhomboid basidiospores and short\ncheilocystidia. Full descriptions, illustrations, and comparisons with\nsimilar species are provided for both species. Bayesian and Maximum\nLikelihood analyses were performed employing sequences of nc ITS rDNA,\nincluding seven new sequences from historical type collections. As\nexpected, the results showed the phylogenetic position of the new\nspecies described here within Deconica sect. Chrysocystidiatae. The\nclade Chrysocystidiatae comprises many species, the majority with\nchrysocystidia, ten of them new unnamed taxa. At this time, two taxa are\ndescribed. Additionally, discussion of the traits found in the four\nmajor clades of Deconica is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Deconica","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128446.phy"}]}
