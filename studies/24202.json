In this study,\neight fungal isolates were obtained from twenty stem blight lesions of\nblueberry collected in Nanping, Fujian province, China. Asexual stage\nwas observed after inducing sporulation, the morphology of which agrees\nwith Macrophomina in the black, smooth, hard sclerotia and ellipsoid to\nobovoid, smooth hyaline conidia with apical sheath. Furthermore, DNA\nsequences of concatenated ITS, tef1-Î±, TUB, and ACT loci indicated that\nthese isolates belong to a novel fungal species. The distinguishing\nmorphological characteristics, such as the wider conidia and larger\nconidiomata pycnidial, also support its new status. Thus a novel fungus,\nMacrophomina vaccinii, was described in this study. Pathogenicity tests\nindicated that Macrophomina vaccinii could cause stem blight of\nblueberry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116771","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116771.phy"}]}
