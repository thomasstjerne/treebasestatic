Both neighbor-joining and\nparsimony trees showed that species with polyporic acid have evolved\nseveral times and that Hapalopilus, Lopharia, Porostereum and\nPhanerochaete were all polyphyletic. The main Hapalopilus group\nconsisted of four species of Hapalopilus and Porostereum friesii, while\nHapalopilus salmonicolor (= Sarcoporia salmonicolor) came out close to\nthe species of Irpex and Oxyporus and proved to be a distinct\ntaxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hapalopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5530.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hapalopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5531.phy"}]}
