Since then, many additional ambrosia beetle symbionts have\nbeen added to the genus, including the important tree pathogens R.\nquercivora, R. quercus-mongolicae, and R. lauricola, causal agents of\nJapanese and Korean oak wilt and laurel wilt, respectively. The\ndiscovery of new and the dispersal of described species of Raffaelea to\nnew areas, where they can become invasive, presents challenges for\ndiagnosticians as well as plant protection and quarantine efforts. In\nthis paper, we present the first comprehensive multigene phylogenetic\nanalysis of Raffaelea. As it is currently defined, the genus was found\nto not be monophyletic. On the basis of this work, Raffaelea sensu\nstricto is defined and the affinities of undescribed isolates are\nconsidered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLLSU","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Raffaelea Ambrosia Beetle Symbionts","tree_kind":"Gene
