Petrocosmea Oliver\n(Gesneriaceae) currently comprises 42 species with four non-nominate\nvarieties, nearly all of which have been described solely from herbarium\nspecimens. However, the dried specimens have obscured the full range of\nextremely diverse morphological variation that exists in the genus and\nhas resulted in a poor subgeneric classification system that does not\nreflect the evolutionary history of this group. It is important to\ndevelop innovative methods to find new morphological traits and\nreexamine and reevaluate the traditionally used morphological data based\non new hypothesis. In addition, Petrocosmea distributed in the eastern\nwing region of the Himalaya-Tibetan plateau is of particular interesting\nin addressing a challenge question whether plant evolution and diversity\nis promoted by the Himalaya uplift.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocosmea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88333.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocosmea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88334.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocosmea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88335.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocosmea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88336.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Petrocosmea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88337.phy"}]}
