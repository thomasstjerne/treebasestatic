It differs from known species of\nEutypella with strongly allantoid or semicircular ascospores, like E.\ncrustata and E. curvispora (now Peroneutya curvispora), by larger\nascospores sometimes almost forming a circle and broader stromata, among\nother differences. Molecular data of ITS rDNA region show that the new\nspecies is a sister taxon of Eutypella cerviculata, the type species of\nthe genus Eutypella. Diatrype bermudensis on stems of Guadua\nangustifolia is reported for Panama for the first time, being reported\nup to now apparently only from Bermuda.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diatrypaceae from Panama","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57778.phy"}]}
