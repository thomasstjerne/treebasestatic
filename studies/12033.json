They have an\nelongated body, recurved posterior eye row and third legs directed\nforward. There are currently five known species of Aysenia. The study of\nall the specimens of Aysenia available in collections showed the\nexistence of three undescribed species and the unknown male of A.\nelongata, all of which are here described. New geographical records are\nprovided for all species, with illustrations and reviewed diagnosis for\nthe genus and the previously known species. Data from the new species\nand the male of A. elongata are used to test the monophyly of the genus,\nits relationships with other genera in the family, and among its\nspecies. The phylogenetic analysis using cladistic methods uses\nobservations from 264 previously defined characters plus three\ncharacters that arise from this study, scored for 104 species of\nAnyphaenidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aysenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49038.phy"}]}
