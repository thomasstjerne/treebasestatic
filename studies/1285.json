Oreosyce\nafricana and Mukia maderaspatana served as the outgroup. The qualitative\ncharacters alone yielded a more resolved hypothesis than the qualitative\nand quantitative characters combined. Cucumis was polyphyletic, and\nCucumella paraphyletic, sensu Farris. The Cucumella species are\ntransferred to Cucumis, making it a monophyletic group. When the\nCucumis\u001aCucumella species were reanalyzed with the known hybrid Cucumis \u001a\nhytivus, it had little affect on the phylogenetic hypothesis, and its\nhybridity and parentage could not be deduced from the results.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucumis-Cucumella with hybrid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_233.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cucumis-Cucumella without hybrid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2031.phy"}]}
