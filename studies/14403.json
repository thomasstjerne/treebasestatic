The anamorphic powdery mildew on C. camphora has hitherto\nbeen known as Pseudoidium cinnamomi, but its relationship to a\nteleomorph was unknown. For M. paniculata as substrate of powdery\nmildew, only an anamorphic Cystotheca species has been known.\nMorphological investigation of the fungus on this host shows that the\nspecimens from Taiwan belong to another genus outside the Cystotheceae\nbecause of the lack of fibrosin bodies. Analysis of ITS rDNA sequences\nindicates that the anamorphic powdery mildews on camphor and orange\njasmine belong to a clade representing Erysiphe quercicola, with the\nteleomorph known only from certain oak species (Quercus, Fagaceae), but\nwith its anamorph known from a broad host range, particularly in the\ntropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"result","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_64870.phy"}]}
