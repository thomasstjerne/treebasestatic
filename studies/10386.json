We sequenced the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA\ngenome in 417 monoconidial cultures collected from 20 sites in\nWashington, Idaho, Utah, and Colorado, USA. ITS sequence diversity was\nsurprisingly high; 12 unique haplotypes were identified, averaging 1.3%\npairwise sequence divergence. All sites had at least two haplotypes\npresent, and three sites had seven or more. One haplotype comprised 60%\nof the isolates and occurred at all 20 locations; the remaining\nhaplotypes generally occurred at low frequencies within sites, but at\nmultiple sites throughout the region. Sites in Washington and Idaho were\nmore diverse than those in Utah and Colorado, averaging 2 more\nhaplotypes and 67% more pairwise differences among haplotypes at a site.\nAnalysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) indicated that more than 80% of\nthe genetic variation is found within sampling locations, while 7 Â– 11%\nof the variation can be attributed to differences between northern\n(Washington and Idaho) and southern (Utah and Colorado) populations. The\nwide distribution of even uncommon haplotypes among sampling sites, and\nweak correlations between genetic and geographic distances among\npopulations (< 0.2), suggest that these populations were recently\nestablished from a common source. We hypothesize that the strains of P.\nsemeniperda infecting B. tectorum in western North America probably\narrived with the invasive grass from its native Eurasian range.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7800.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7803.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7804.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7801.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7802.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7806.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora semeniperda on Bromus tectorum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_7805.phy"}]}
