Recent DNA\nsequence comparisons revealed polyphyletic nature of the genus and found\ndistant relationship between its infrageneric taxa. Here we present the\nfirst molecular phylogeny of Orostachys subsection Appendiculatae based\non a large number of ITS rDNA sequences representing most currently\nrecognized members of the subsection and utilizing secondary structure\ninformation. Ribosomal spacer was a highly informative marker and\nprovided a phylogenetic signal sufficient to resolve relationships at\ndifferent scales, from affinities between species to a fine geographic\nstructure in broadly sampled species. It was also conservative enough to\nallow unambiguous alignment and construction of consensus secondary\nstructure models for ITS1 and ITS2. These models displayed a number of\nmolecular synapomorphies defining most lineages established in our\nanalyses. We revealed a major split in the subsection placing three\nspecies, O. spinosa, O. japonica and O. chanetii, into a strongly\nsupported clade to the exclusion of O. thyrsiflora. Phenotypically\ndistinct monotypic genus Meterostachys was also resolved as a part of\nthe subsectionâs clade and showed affinity to O. thyrsiflora. Our data\nsuggested that morphology-based species concept for O. thyrsiflora\nrequire reassessment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr78425","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_78425.phy"}]}
