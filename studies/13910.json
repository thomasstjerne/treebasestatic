All the new species are compared with previously\ndescribed resinicolous mycocalicioid taxa, and several new features in\nthese species are presented. The newly described species cannot always\nbe distinguished by any single character, but they all possess unique\ncombinations of morphological, chemical and ecological features. Several\naspects in the ecology and evolution of boreal and tropical resinicolous\nspecies are briefly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60911.phy"}]}
