Twenty-one\nphylogenetic species were recognized among the studied collections.\nSeven of them were described as new: P. brunneiceps, P.imbricatus, P.\nmaculatus, P. pachycystidiatus, P. rubeolus, P. rubrosquamosus, and P.\nyunnanensis. Additional four of them were corresponded with the previous\nmorphology-based taxa: P. bellus, P. luxiensis, P. parvisporus and P.\nrufescens. The remaining ten phylogenetic species were not described due\nto the paucity of materials. A key to the Chinese morphologically\nrecognizable taxa was provided. A preliminary biogeographical analysis\nshowed that (1) Pylloporus species in East Asia and Southeast Asia are\nmostly closely related; (2) Species pairs or closely related species of\nPhylloporus between East Asia and North/Central America are relatively\ncommon; (3) The biogeographic relationship of Phylloporus between East\nAsia and Europe was supported by only a single species pair. Unexpected,\nno taxon common to both Europe and East Asia or East Asia and\nNorth/Central America were uncovered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85677","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85677.phy"}]}
