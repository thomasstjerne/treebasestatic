The\nintroductions are based on morphology and molecular analysis of DNA\nsequence data. We also recovered two fresh isolates of Dictyocheirospora\nrotunda D Souza, Bhat & K.D. Hyde, which is a first record for\nChina. Descriptions and illustrations of D. aquatica, D. garethjonesii\nand D. rotunda are provided. The phylogenetic analysis of combined ITS\nand LSU sequence data place the isolates within the family\nDictyosporiaceae (Pleosporales). A synopsis of characters of the\naccepted species of Dictyocheirospora is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110819","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110819.phy"}]}
