Fruiting of post-fire morels\nin eastern North America, by comparison, are rare and limited to a\nreport from Minnesota in 1977 and Eastern Ontario in 1991. However, the\nspecies reported in these two studies cannot be verified in the absence\nof voucher specimens and supporting molecular systematic data. Here,\nnuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences were\nused to identify the post-fire morel that fruited in great abundance the\nyear following the 2012 Duck Lake Fire in the Upper Peninsula of\nMichigan and after the 2016 large-scale fire in Great Smoky Mountains\nNational Park in Tennessee as M. exuberans. Because this fire-adapted\nspecies has a transcontinental disjunct distribution, a 4-gene dataset\nwas assembled that included partial sequences from three nuclear\nprotein-coding genes (RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1) and ITS + D1/D2 domains of\nnuclear large subunit rDNA to compare the collections from Michigan and\nTennessee with those from western North America, Europe and China. The\npreliminary analysis suggests the collections from eastern North America\nare more closely related to ones from Europe than from the other regions\nsampled.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Morchella exuberans EF1, RPB1, rDNA, RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109623.phy"}]}
