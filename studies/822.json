Sequences of the entire ITS\nregion, including the 5.8S rDNA, of 59 isolates representing 54 species\nwere analyzed and the phylogeny inferred using parsimony and distance\nanalyses. Isolates grouped into three well-supported clades. The results\nof this study support the separation of Phaeosphaeria from Leptosphaeria\nsensu stricto. Leptosphaeria bicolor and the morphologically similar\nLeptosphaeria taiwanensis formed a separate, well-supported clade. We\nconclude that peridial wall morphology, anamorph characteristics, and to\na lesser extent host, are phylogenetically significant at the generic\nlevel. Ascospore and conidial morphology are taxonomically useful at the\nspecies level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phaeosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1215.phy"}]}
