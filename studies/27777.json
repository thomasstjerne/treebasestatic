The\nspecies is characterized by soft gelatinous, yellowish brown to brownish\norange, cerebriform basidioma when fresh, thin-walled, globose to\nsubglobose or broad ellipsoid basidia with a basal clamp connection,\nglobose to subglobose basidiospores measuring 15.019.0 × 14.017.5 µm,\nwith obvious apiculus, and growing on rotten wood of Liquidambar\nformosana. The phylogeny of Tremella s.s. is constructed using methods\nof Maximum parsimony, Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses based on\nthe combined internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), internal\ntranscribed spacer regions (ITS) and the large subunit (nLSU) dataset\nrespectively. The results indicate that T. zhejiangensis forms a lineage\nindependent of other species lineage from other species. The illustrated\ndescription of the new species is provided and their related species are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129150","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129150.phy"}]}
