Maximum\nlikelihood and maximum parsimony molecular phylogenetic analyses of\nsingle and multilocus DNA sequence data indicated the strains\nrepresented 46 genealogically exclusive phylogenetically distinct\nspecies distributed among eight species complexes. Moreover, the\nphylogenetic data revealed that 80/158 strains were received under a\nname that is not accepted today (ex. F. moniliforme) or classified under\na different species name. In addition, gas chromatography-mass\nspectrometry (GC-MS) and/or high performance liquid chromatography-mass\nspectrometry-(HPLC-MS)-based mycotoxin analyses were conducted to\ndetermine what toxins the strains could produce in liquid and/or solid\ncultures. All of the trichothecene toxin-producing fusaria were nested\nwithin the F. sambucinum (FSAMSC) or F. incarnatum-equiseti (FIESC)\nspecies complexes. Consistent with this finding, GC-MS analyses detected\ntrichothecenes in agmatine-containing broth or rice culture extracts of\nall 13 FSAMSC and 10/12 FIESC species tested. Species in six and seven\nof the eight species complexes were able to produce moniliformin and\nbeauvericin mycotoxins, respectively, whereas B-type fumonisins were\nonly detected in extracts of cracked maize kernel cultures of three\nspecies in the F. fujikuroi species complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig S1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium solani species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113007.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium sambucinum species complex TEF1 RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113006.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium fujikuroi species complex TEF1 RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113004.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium tricinctum species complex TEF1 RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113002.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium incarnatum equiseti species complex TEF1 RPB2\nrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113003.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MRC Fusarium strains RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113005.phy"}]}
