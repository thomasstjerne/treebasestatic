The well\nsupported monophyly of the ribosomal sequences sampled from Coursetia\ngreenmanii suggests that this species has had a long history independent\nof other close relatives including the sympatric Coursetia caribaea,\nwhich shows niche conservatism to the same seasonally dry tropical\nvegetation. Coalescence of intraspecific samples of ribosomal sequences\nfrom this narrowly distributed species is possibly related to the high\nlevels of dispersal limitation within seasonally dry tropical forests.\nThe geographical phylogenetic structure found for Coursetia greenmanii\nrepresents the general case for species of the genus Coursetia and\nclosely related genera of the tribe Robinieae, most of which coalesce\nwith respect to nuclear ribosomal sequence variation and are\ngeographically concentrated in relatively small subregions of seasonally\ndry Neotropical vegetation that is rich in cacti and other succulent\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coursetia greenmanii","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6510.phy"}]}
