Gloxinia\nmajor has been problematic to place taxonomically due to the\nmorphological similarity with Gloxinia erinoides. Here, we present a\nmolecular phylogenetic study and morphological that allowed us to\ndemonstrate that Gloxinia major is currently recognized as a separate\nspecies from G. erinoides, this species is described, illustrated, and\ncompared to morphologically similar species. Also data on its\ndistribution, habitat, and taxonomic treatment are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gloxinia ITS trnL-F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117043.phy"}]}
