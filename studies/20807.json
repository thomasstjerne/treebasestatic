Powdery mildew is one of the most important diseases\nof these plants. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the causal agent\nErysiphe pulchra showed that this species is divided into two genetic\ngroups, viz. a group found on C. florida and C. kousa, and another group\non C. controversa. Combined with detailed morphological examinations, E.\npulchra s. str. and E. pulchra-japonicae nom. nov. are proposed for the\nrespective fungal groups.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epulchra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103152.phy"}]}
