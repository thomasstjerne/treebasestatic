The placement of the Celastrales-Oxalidales-Malpighiales\n(COM) clade within Rosidae remains one of the most confounding\nphylogenetic questions in angiosperms, with previous analyses placing it\nwith either Fabidae or Malvidae. To elucidate the position of COM, we\nassembled multi-gene matrices of chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear\nsequences, as well as large single- and multi-copy nuclear gene data\nsets. Analyses of multi-gene data sets demonstrate conflict between the\nchloroplast and both nuclear and mitochondrial data sets, and the\nresults are robust to various character-coding and data-exclusion\ntreatments. Analyses of single- and multi-copy nuclear loci indicate\nthat most loci support the placement of COM with Malvidae, fewer loci\nsupport COM with Fabidae, and almost no loci support COM outside a clade\nof Fabidae and Malvidae. Although incomplete lineage sorting and ancient\nintrogressive hybridization remain as plausible explanations for the\nconflict among loci, more complete sampling is necessary to evaluate\nthese hypotheses fully. Our results emphasize the importance of genomic\ndata sets for revealing deep incongruence and complex patterns of\nevolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr79563","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_79563.phy"}]}
