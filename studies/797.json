{"Authors":" Mark E Olson","Year":" 2002","Title":" Combining data from DNA sequences and morphology for a\nphylogeny of Moringaceae (Brassicales)","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":" 27","Issue":" 1","Pages":" 55-73","Keywords":"","DOI":" 10.1043/0363-6445-27.1.55","Abstract":" The Old World dry tropical family Moringaceae is\nremarkable for the great diversity of habit and floral morphology found\nwithin its only genus, Moringa. To infer the phylogenetic relationships\nof all 13 species, parsimony analyses of morphological data and DNA\nsequences from a low-copy nuclear region (PEPC), a chloroplast region\n(trnG), and a tandemly-repeated nuclear region present in high copy\nnumber (ITS) were conducted of each data set separately and combined.\nCharacters from studies of ontogeny substantially enhanced the\nresolution of the morphological data set. The Incongruence Length\nDifference test indicated the congruence of all data sets, as did\nTempleton tests comparing the single tree resulting from the combined\nanalysis in the context of the individual data sets. This tree is\npresented as the preferred topology, in which the four bottle trees\nappear in a basal paraphyletic assemblage, with the three species of\nslender trees (including the economically important M. oleifera) forming\na clade that is sister to a clade of the six species of tuberous shrubs\nand trees of northeast Africa. Moringa is currently divided into three\nsections, but because of the basal grade, it cannot be divided into\nuseful monophyletic infrageneric taxa. The phylogeny-based informal\nterms “bottle tree grade”, “slender tree clade”, and “tuberous clade”\nare suggested as alternatives. Relationships within Moringa were found\nto be largely congruent with a previous study of wood anatomy.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PEPC tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3933.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 18","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3934.phy"},{"tree_label":"PEPC tree 2","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3932.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 16","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3936.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 13","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3939.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnG tree 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3954.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 12","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3940.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 17","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3935.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 15","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3937.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 14","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3938.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 11","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3941.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 10","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3942.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 9","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3943.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 8","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3944.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 7","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3945.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 6","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3946.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnG tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3955.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 5","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3947.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 4","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3948.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3949.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3950.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3951.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnG tree 4","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3952.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnG tree 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moringaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3953.phy"}]}
