Erionema includes 15 species from eastern\nAustralia and one from southwest Australia. We conducted a phylogenetic\nanalysis of the section, including samples of all species, using\nsequences of the ITS and ETS regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results\nwere broadly congruent with a previous analysis based on morphological\nand flavonoid data. The analysis is consistent with the monophyly of the\nsection and supports the monophyly of six species represented by\nmultiple samples. Philotheca verrucosa was resolved as paraphyletic with\nrespect to P. freyciana, but with poor support. Philotheca\nglasshousiensis, P. myoporoides and P. myoporoides subsp. myoporoides\nwere clearly polyphyletic, including separate, geographic clades, and\nthe classifications of each of these taxa requires revision. In\nparticular, disjunct northern populations of P. glasshousiensis probably\nrepresent a distinct species, the five subspecies of P. myoporoides\ncould be treated as separate species, and at least two other distinct\ngroups could be treated as species, which are currently included under\nthe circumscription of subsp. myoporoides. The phylogeny revealed deeply\ndivergent, geographically overlapping clades in eastern Australia, and\nsubstantial distances (up to 900 km) between sister taxa. We infer that\nbiogeography of the group has been shaped largely by vicariant\ndifferentiation of taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"withindels","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123896","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123896.phy"}]}
