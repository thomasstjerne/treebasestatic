Strobilomyces minor is characterized by its small basidiomata,\nlight yellowish-brown adpressed pyramidal scales on the pileus and\nstipe, large pores, reticulate basidiospores with large meshes. Maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses based on four gene markers (rpb1, rpb2,\ntef1 and cox3) as well as morphological characters confirmed that this\nnew taxon belongs to Strobilomyces and it is distinct from any known\nspecies. A morphological description with line drawings and SEM images\nfor the species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Strobilomyces","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116470.phy"}]}
