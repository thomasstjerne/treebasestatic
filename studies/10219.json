Here, phylogenetic hypotheses are\nproposed to describe the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the\ngenus with respect to drainage basin evolution and to assess species\ndiversity, particularly among populations variably identified as M.\nabbreviatus or M. depressus. Twenty-three ingroup taxa were examined,\nincluding eight known species and representatives of the M.\nabbreviatus-depressus complex. Allozyme data from 12 loci were analysed\nphenetically and cladistically. Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the\n12S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes were analysed\nas a combined mtDNA data set and as a total data set in combination with\nrecoded allele frequency data. Analyses retrieved (1) a monophyletic\nMesamphisopus; (2) M. tsitsikamma and a M. paludosus + M. penicillatus\nclade as basal lineages; (3) a M. capensis + M. baccatus clade; and (4)\na clade containing the M. abbreviatus-depressus complex, with these taxa\nnested among several other species. Large genetic distances among taxa\nand the paraphyly of the members of the M. abbreviatus-depressus complex\nsuggested the presence of hidden taxonomic diversity in Mesamphisopus.\nClear biogeographic patterns emerged with lineages and clades mostly\nrestricted to geographically discrete regions. Patterns showed\nremarkable similarity to those seen in the regionÂ’s terrestrial fauna and\nbore no relation to the history of drainage basins. These patterns\nsuggested that vicariance and, possibly, limited long-distance dispersal\nevents played a major role in the evolution of Mesamphisopus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Allozyme strict MP","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6849.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6763.phy"},{"tree_label":"Total data Bayesian","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6841.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined mtDNA Bayesian","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6868.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6785.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3 strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mesamphisopus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6731.phy"}]}
