In horticulture,\nthe production of healthy and vigorous tomato seedlings is a key step in\nthe process leading to the establishment of productive tomato plant\nstands, able to bear fruit of high quality. Production of seedlings\nusually takes place in greenhouses to reduce the impact of varying\nweather conditions. However, excessive humidity, slow seedling emergence\nand soil-dwelling pathogens like Pythium spp. can lead to losses by\ndamping-off. In this work, we describe the biocontrol and plant growth\npromotion activity of strain ILBB 145 of S. ureilytica, characterize the\nphenotypic traits that could help explain the observed activities, and\nexplore its genome in relation with genomes of two other strains of S.\nureilytica and S. marcescens to further account for genetic determinants\nof pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance that could hamper its use\nas PGPB.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90601","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90601.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90600","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90600.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90602","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90602.phy"}]}
