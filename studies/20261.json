We have surveyed Grape\nwhite rot in five provinces in China and collected 27 isolates from\ndiseased grape tissues. Multigene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU,\nHistone and TEF 1-) and genealogical concordance phylogenetic species\nrecognition, coupled with morphological observations revealed that\nConiella vitis sp. nov., in addition to Coniella diplodiella, are both\ncausative agents of grape white rot in China. The current study also\nprovides an optimized multi-gene backbone for resolving Coniella\nspecies. Kochs postulates were performed on the species on Vitis\nvinifera summer black cultivar, in a green house. These results\nconfirmed the pathogenicity as symptoms were reproduced and significant\nvariations in the pathogenicity among C. vitis isolates was shown. This\nwork provides evidence that Coniella vitis is the main causal agent of\ngrape white rot in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr100302","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_100302.phy"}]}
