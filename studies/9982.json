Here, we proposed a new\nspecies inhabiting in Festuca parvigluma Steud. native to China.\nMorphology, host specificity and molecular phylogenetic evidences\nsupported erection of this new species. Sequences of Â-tubulin gene\n(tubB) introns and translation elongation factor 1- Á gene (tefA)\nintrons presented two copies in all 5 isolates tested. In phylogenetic\nanalysis, copy 1 closely related with E. yangzii in EBY clade, copy 2\nwith E. typhina in ETC, indicating this new species possibly origin from\nhybridization of these two clades. Referring to distribution area of\nhost plants, ¡°Neotyphodium sinofestucae Y. Ji, Y. Chen et Z. Wang, sp.\nnov.¡± was proposed for this new species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 tubB","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe Neotyphodium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 tefA","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Epichloe Neotyphodium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6290.phy"}]}
