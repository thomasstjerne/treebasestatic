DNA sequence data from one such enigmatic fungus,\nLaboulbeniopsis termitarius, supports its phylogenetic position as\nmember of a Laboulbeniomycete clade within the Ascomycota. This clade is\ncomposed entirely of fungi associated with arthropods, often as\nparasites, and the inclusion of L. termitarius supports the single\norigin thallus development by means of enlargement and division of the\nspore.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laboulbeniomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_891.phy"}]}
