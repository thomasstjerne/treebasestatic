The\ncircumscription of genera in this group has long been controversial,\nparticularly with respect to Cassine and Elaeodendron. Cassine, narrowly\ndefined so as to include three species native to southern Africa, was\nunambiguously supported as distinct from Elaeodendron. The widely\ndistributed genus Elaeodendron was supported as a natural group, sister\nto Pleurostylia. Brexia, which has been variously assigned to the\nEscalloniaceae, Brexiaceae, and Grossulariaceae, was unambiguously\nsupported as the sister group to the clade of Elaeodendron and\nPleurostylia. Preliminary species sampling supported Empleuridium, which\nhad been classified within the Rutaceae, as related to Mystroxylon,\nPseudosalacia, and Robsonodendron. Allocassine and Lauridia were\nresolved as closely related to one another, supporting their previously\ninferred relationship. Maurocenia and Cassine were supported as closely\nrelated to one another, with evidence for Maurocenia being nested within\nCassine. Lydenburgia abbottii was resolved as closely related to\nLydenburgia cassinoides, supporting its transfer from Catha. Three new\ncombinations are made: Elaeodendron bupleuroides (Guillaumin) R.H.\nArcher, Elaeodendron parvifolium R.H. Archer, and Elaeodendron\npininsulare Hürl. subsp. Poyaense (I.H. Müller) R.H. Archer.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS nrDNA","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2459.phy"},{"tree_label":"26 nrDNA Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2460.phy"},{"tree_label":"matK cpDNA Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2461.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnLF cpDNA Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2462.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morph Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2463.phy"},{"tree_label":"Simultaneous Strict","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Elaeodendron Group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2464.phy"}]}
