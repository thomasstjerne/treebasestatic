The phylogenetic position of the\nArmillaria sp. was determined using sequences of elongation factor-1α\n(EF-1α) gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region\n(ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of rDNA. The phylogenetic tree based on EF-1α and ITS\nsequences showed that this species differs from known Japanese\nArmillaria spp. The sequences of this species were part of a strongly\nsupported clade that contained A. novae-zelandiae from Southeast Asia,\nand part of a well-supported sister clade that contained A.\nnovae-zelandiae from Australia and New Zealand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9250.phy"}]}
