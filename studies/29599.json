Fulvoderma yunnanense\nis characterized by annual, laterally stipitate basidiomata with greyish\nbrown pore surface, a monomitic hyphal system with simple septate\ngenerative hyphae, tubular cystidia and broad ellipsoid to subglobose,\nthin-walled, smooth basidiospores measuring as 4.05.4 ×3.34.8 µm.\nSequences of ITS and nLSU rRNA gene regions of the specimens were\ngenerated and phylogenetic analyses were carried out with methods of\nmaximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The\nphylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS+nLSU indicated that Fulvoderma\nyunnanense nested in Fulvoderma within Hymenochaetaceae. Further study\nwithin Fulvoderma on the basis of ITS dataset revealed that it formed a\nmonophyletic lineage with a strong support and then grouped with F.\naustrale.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136197","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136199","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136199.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136198","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136198.phy"}]}
