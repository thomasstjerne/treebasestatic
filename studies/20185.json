We sequenced 581 individuals for one mitochondrial\ngene (cytochrome-b) and for a subset we sequenced another mitochondrial\ngene (12S rRNA) and two nuclear genes: kinesin family member 24 (KIF24)\nand the anonymous nuclear locus LDAB1D. We estimated gene trees,\nmitochondrial and nuclear haploytpe networks, standard molecular\ndiversity indices, genetic distances between lineages, and Bayesian\nSkyline Plots. Our results provide evidence for recognition of seven\nspecies previously described within the L. elongatus complex: Liolaemus\nantumalguen, Liolaemus chillanensis, Liolaemus carlosgarini, Liolaemus\nburmeisteri, Liolaemus smaug, Liolaemus elongatus and Liolaemus\ncrandalli; but we did not find sufficient evidence to support Liolaemus\nchoique, Liolaemus shitan, or Liolaemus sp. 6 as distinct species. We\nidentified four candidate species (Liolaemus sp. 1, Liolaemus sp. 2,\nLiolaemus sp. 3 and Liolaemus sp. 7), and we discuss evolutionary\nprocesses that may have contributed to the origin of these lineages, and\ntheir taxonomic and conservation implications.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99734","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99734.phy"}]}
