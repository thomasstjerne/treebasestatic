Within the Sterculioideae clade\nfour major clades have good bootstrap support but relationships among\nthem are not resolved. The analyses suggest the recognition of the genus\nArgyrodendron as separate from Heritiera and support Acropogon as\nseparate from Sterculia, and Tarrietia as part of Heritiera. The current\ncircumscriptions of Hildegardia and Firmiana is not supported. The use\nof fruit characters in the delimitation of genera within the\nSterculioideae may not be appropriate for some genera and other\nmorphological characters need to be found.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sterculioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree not shown in paper","ntax":"160","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Malvaceae s.l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_308.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sterculioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_486.phy"}]}
