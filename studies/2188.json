Following\ncharacter analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction (25 taxa, 96\nmorphological characters, 1452 ribosomal and mitochondrial characters),\nthis informal genus group was found to be monophyletic, and hence raised\nto formal recognition as a tribe of eucoilines, namely Zaeucoilini new\ntribe. Through phylogenetic reconstruction, Aegeseucoela Buffington was\ndetermined to be polyphyletic; the type species of Aegeseucoela, A.\ngrenadensis (Ashmead), is transferred to Agrostocynips comb.n.; the\norphaned species, A. flavotincta (Kieffer), is transferred to Marthiella\nBuffington gen.n., comb.n. Based on the examination of the holotype of\nDiranchis flavipes Ashmead, 1900, this species is transferred to\nRhabdeucoela comb.n., where it is both a junior, subjective synonym of\nflavipes (Ashmead, 1894) syn.n. and a junior, secondary homonym.\nZaeucoilini contains the following genera: Agrostocynips Diaz, Dettmeria\nBorgmeier, Dicerataspis Ashmead, Lopheucoila Weld, Marthiella\nBuffington, Moneucoela Kieffer, Moritiella Buffington, Penteucoila Weld,\nPreseucoela Buffington, Rhabdeucoela Kieffer, Tropideucoila Ashmead and\nZaeucoila Ashmead. Characters and character states applicable\nspecifically to Zaeucoilini are defined and illustrated. Characters\nsupporting the monophyly of each genus are discussed. The plesiomorphic\nhost for members of the Zaeucoilini are postulated as agromyzid\nleaf-mining Diptera, with one shift within the clade containing\nDettmeria, Dicerataspis and Lopheucoila to fruit-infesting Diptera. New\nhost records are reported for species of Preseucoela, Rhabdeucoela and\nZaeucoila. All known hosts for the species of each genus are reported,\nas are known distributions and locations of type specimens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Paup 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5385.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5386.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5388.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 6","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5383.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5384.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5387.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 9","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5380.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5381.phy"},{"tree_label":"Paup 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zaeucoilini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5382.phy"}]}
