In a previous study,\nlaboratory mating of F. tucumaniae yielded recombinant ascospore\nprogeny, but required two mating-compatible strains, indicating that it\nis heterothallic. To assess the reproductive mode of the other SDS and\nBRR fusaria, and their potential for mating, whole-genome sequences of\ntwo SDS and one BRR pathogen were analyzed to characterize their mating\ntype (MAT) loci. This bioinformatic approach identified a MAT1-1\nidiomorph in F. virguliforme NRRL 22292 and MAT1-2 idiomorphs in F.\ntucumaniae NRRL 34546 and F. azukicola NRRL 54364. Alignments of the MAT\nloci were used to design PCR primers within the conserved regions of the\nflanking genes APN1 and SLA2, which enabled primer walking to obtain\nnearly complete sequences of the MAT region for six MAT1-1 and five\nMAT1-2 SDS/BRR fusaria. As expected, the sequences of the highly\ndivergent 4.7 kb MAT1-1 and 3.7 kb MAT1-2 idiomorphs were unalignable.\nHowever, the sequences of the respective idiomorphs and those that flank\nMAT1-1 and MAT1-2, were highly conserved. In addition to three genes at\nMAT1-1 (MAT1-1-1, MAT1-1-2 and MAT1-1-3) and two at MAT1-2 (MAT1-2-1 and\nMAT1-2-3), the MAT loci of SDS/BRR fusaria appeared to have expanded to\ninclude a putative gene predicted to encode for a 252 amino acid protein\nof unknown function. Alignments of the MAT1-1-3 and MAT1-2-1 sequences\nwere used to design a multiplex PCR assay for the MAT loci. This assay\nwas used to screen DNA from 439 SDS/BRR isolates, which revealed that\neach isolate possessed MAT1-1 or MAT1-2, consistent with heterothallism.\nBoth idiomorphs were represented among isolates of F. azukicola, F.\nbrasiliense, F. phaseoli and F. tucumaniae, whereas isolates of F.\nvirguliforme and F. cuneirostrum were only MAT1-1 and F.\ncrassistipitatum were only MAT1-2. Although phylogenies inferred from\nMAT were mostly unresolved, consistent with their hypothesized\nrelatively recent evolutionary origin, analyses of the MAT locus\nsequences and six other loci suggested that Fusarium sp. NRRL 22411 may\nrepresent an interspecific hybrid between F. brasiliense and F.\nphaseoli-like parents.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Intergenic E","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66846.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 96","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66844.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 44","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66842.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66847.phy"},{"tree_label":"IGS rDNA","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66851.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 81","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66850.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66848.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAT1-2 Region","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68074.phy"},{"tree_label":"MAT1-1 Region","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68073.phy"},{"tree_label":"Intergenic A","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusaria, Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Bean Root\nRot","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66849.phy"}]}
