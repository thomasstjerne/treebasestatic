New Method Based on\nIsolation-by-Distance Objectively Gives the Answer","Journal":" Molecular Ecology Resources","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" Random sampling is an important statistical assumption,\nbut virtually impossible when sampling a wild species as we cannot know\nwhere all the individuals exist. While inter-population or intra-taxa\nsampling methods have been developed, there are currently few\nintra-taxon sampling methods to objectively decide where to sample wild\ntaxa. We suggest a new sampling method which computes appropriate\nsampling locations from coordinates, assuming geographical\nautocorrelation of phylogeny within a taxon (isolation-by-distance). The\ncomputed locations encompass the highest genetic diversity, providing a\ngenetically representative sample. In addition, it can utilize\npresence/absence information during sampling to re-optimize sampling\nscheme. Comparing to the single existing method of the similar purpose,\nthe merits of ours is unnecessity of environmental data resulting in\neasy application, and is theoretically deduced. We tested this method\nusing published phylogeographical data. The test result was generally\nencouraging, but the method failed where species showed uniform genetic\nstructure or recent distribution expansion which violate the assumption\nof geographical autocorrelation of phylogeny. Though simple, our method\nconstructs a methodological and statistical foundation for sampling wild\nspecies, and is applicable to revising taxonomic study and conservation\nbiology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita muscaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125000.phy"}]}
