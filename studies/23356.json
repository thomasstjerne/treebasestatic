However, based on the morphological data, this\ngenus has long been reduced to synonymy of several genera of various\ntribes for more than one hundred years. Alternatively, phylogenetic\nplacement using molecular data have never been studied. Therefore, in\nthis study we explored the phylogenetic placement of Machaerophorus to\ntest its generic status and tribal assignment, using for this purpose\nribosomal nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnL-F, trnH-psbA, rps16\nintron) data together with a comprehensive sampling of taxa. Results\nobtained here demonstrated that Machaerophorus represents a\nwell-differentiated lineage within the South American\nCremolobeae-Eudemeae-Schizopetaleae (CES) clade, and hence the genus is\nreinstated and excluded from the placements in Sibara and Mathewsia.\nBased on molecular data and morphological affinities, we included it\nwithin the tribe Schizopetaleae. A key to Machaerophorus and the genera\nof Schizopetaleae is also presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114115.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114116","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114116.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114114","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114114.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Brassicaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114113.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114117.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114118","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114118.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114119","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114119.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114121","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114121.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCCT1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114122","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114122.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114123","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114123.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCCT1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114124","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114124.phy"},{"tree_label":"MCCT1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114125","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114125.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114120","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114120.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr114126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114126.phy"}]}
