Here we\nprovide a taxonomic revision of Osmolindsaea based on morphological\nexamination of herbarium specimens and molecular phylogenetic analysis\nof five plastid loci (trnL-trnF, trnH-psbA, rpoC1, rps4, and rps4-trnS).\nWe recognize seven species in the genus, two of which are here described\nas new to science (O. latisquama and O. leptolepida) and three are\ntransferred to this genus from Lindsaea (O. himalaica, O. minor, and O.\nplumula). A key to the species is provided, as well as descriptions,\nillustrations, synonymy, and a list of examined specimens for each\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"0211+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69761.phy"},{"tree_label":"0221+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69762.phy"},{"tree_label":"0111+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69760.phy"},{"tree_label":"3211+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69764.phy"},{"tree_label":"3111+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69763.phy"},{"tree_label":"3221+","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmolindsaea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69765.phy"}]}
