Due to\nconvergent morphological evolution and disjunct distributions,\nrelationships within Saxifragaceae have historically been problematic.\nThe family primarily occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in\nmountainous regions, with the greatest number of genera and species in\nWestern North America. Here, we integrate broad gene (56 loci) and taxon\nsampling (223 species) strategies, both the most comprehensive to date\nwithin Saxifragaceae, with fossil calibrations and geographical\ndistribution data to address relationships among major Saxifragaceae\nlineages, divergence times, and historical biogeography. Two lineages,\nthe heucheroids (8 groups + Saniculiphyllum) and saxifragoids (Saxifraga\ns.s, which includes Saxifragella but not Micranthes), were recovered in\nour phylogenetic analyses. Divergence time estimates indicate that\nSaxifragaceae began to diversify ca. 38.37 million years ago or Mya (95%\nHPD = 30.99-46.11, Mya) in the Mid-Late Eocene, and that the two major\nlineages, the heucheroids and saxifragoids, began to diversify\napproximately 30.04 Mya (95% HPD = 23.87-37.15 Mya) and 30.85 Mya (95%\nHPD = 23.47-39.33 Mya), respectively. We reconstructed ancestral\ngeographic areas using statistical dispersal-vicariance (S-DIVA). These\nanalyses indicate that there were several radiations within\nSaxifragaceae: one occurred in eastern Asia and there were multiple\nradiations in western North America. Our results also show that large\namounts of sequence data coupled with broad taxon sampling can help\nresolve clade relationships that have thus far seemed intractable.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BEAST","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae 3genes-Sax+BEAST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77368.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA-ML","ntax":"211","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae cpDNA-ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77371.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA+nrDNA-ML","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae cpDNA+nrDNA-ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77370.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA+nrDNA-BI","ntax":"228","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae cpDNA+nrDNA-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_77369.phy"},{"tree_label":"cpDNA-BI","ntax":"211","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae cpDNA-BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77367.phy"}]}
