Both principal components and discriminant analyses\nprovide support to the recognition of the five species considered by the\nauthor, namely E. Iinifolium, E. Iagascae, E. baeticum, E. popovii, and\nE. cazorlense. Cladistic analysis, using 7 characters resulted in a\nsingle most parsimonious cladogram containing no homoplasies. The\npattern of morphologic divergence follows a clear NW.-SE. trend, which\nis congruent with the topology of the cladogram. This trend\nsignificantly affects growth-form as well as fruit characters, both\nproviding the main grounds for species recognition. The different\nbehavior and significance of several characters in both kinds of\nanalysis is discussed. The co-occurrence of morphologically similar\nindividuals differing in the flower color is discussed, too. Possible\nexplanations for this phenomenon involve hybridization in a wide sense\nor, alternatively, rejecting the assumption of monophyly for the\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysimum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_436.phy"}]}
