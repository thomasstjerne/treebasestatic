Venturia fuliginosa forms a soot-like\nphenotype on the leaf surface of the host, and differs from known\nspecies of Venturia in having fusiform, subcylindrical, sometimes\nobpyriform and mostly aseptate conidia. Phylogenetic inferences based on\nthe combined sequences of the 28S and ITS rRNA gene repeat from nuc rDNA\nindicate that the new species is closely related to CBS 470.61 (a strain\nnamed V. chlorospora from Salix daphnoides in 1958 in France). Venturia\ncatenospora is reported for the first time in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Majority-Rule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Venturia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101553.phy"}]}
