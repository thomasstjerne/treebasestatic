The results of these\nstudies indicate that H. schweinitzii comprises at least three distinct\nand taxonomically separable holomorph taxa that coincide with the\ngeographical origin of the collections. The name H. schweinitzii can be\napplied to Northern Hemisphere and H. jecorina to tropical American\ncollections; while taxonomically distinct, no name was given to a\nChinese collection. The holomorphs or H. schweinitzii, H. jecorina, and\nthe Chinese collection showed little intraspecific variation in\nmorphology of the teleomorph or anamorph, or in cultural and isozyme\ncharacters. They exhibited no more variation than was noted in the ex\ntype cultures of the named Trichoderma species. None of the named\nTrichoderma species coincided with any of the Hypocrea species studied.\nIt is concluded that Trichoderma species in general can be narrowly\ndefined but that morphology alone might not suffice to allow the\nidentification of species. The synonymy of T. reesei under T.\nlongibrachiatum is not supported by morphological and cultural\nobservations and by isozyme data and it is therefore not accepted.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1419.phy"}]}
