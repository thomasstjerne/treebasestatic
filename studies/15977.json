Although Acoela is an\nabundant group of the meiofauna knowledge of their diversity is\nincomplete. The Swedish fauna with 66 nominal species is one of the best\nstudied in the world. Despite this new species and species new to the\narea are still found in Swedish waters. In this study, we describe four\nnew species belonging to the family Isodiametridae: Archaphanostoma\nfontaneti sp. n., Archaphanostoma occulta sp. n., Archaphanostoma\nsublittoralis sp. n. and Archaphanostoma ylvae sp. n. The new species\nwere collected on the Swedish west coast and in northern Germany during\n2011. Each description is accompanied by high-quality drawings and\nmicrophotographs. Nucleotide sequences for the ribosomal genes 18S rRNA\nand 28S rRNA as well as for the mitochondrial COI mtDNA gene have been\ndetermined for the new species and used in Bayesian and\nmaximum-likelihood analyses to further support their classi\u0001cation.\nDiagnostic molecular characters are presented for each species, and we\nuse Bayesian methods and statistical parsimony to delimit the new\nspecies within Archaphanostoma. We also use species of Archaphanostoma\nto test patterns of acoel diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"18S28SCOI","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaphanostoma 18S 28S COI species bipartitions\nRAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75603.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaphanostoma 18S bipartitions RAxML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75604.phy"},{"tree_label":"28S","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaphanostoma 28S bipartitions RAxML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75606.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Archaphanostoma COI gene bipartitions RAxML","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75605.phy"}]}
