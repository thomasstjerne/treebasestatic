{"Authors":" Henrik Enghoff, Gitte Petersen, Ole Seberg","Year":" 2013","Title":" The aberrant millipede genus Pteridoiulus and its position in\na revised molecular phylogeny of the family Julidae (Diplopoda,\nJulida).","Journal":" Invertebrate Systematics","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":"","DOI":"","Abstract":" A phylogenetic analysis of 62 species of the Palaearctic\nmillipede family Julidae, including the aberrant genus Pteridoiulus, was\nmade based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and the\nnuclear 28S rRNA genes. Data sets were analysed individually and\ncombined using direct optimization in POY. 16S rDNA and 28S rDNA\nsequences vary from 410 -449 bp and from 467-525 bp, respectively.\nSearches were performed under six different gap opening costs, extension\ngap cost = 1, substitution cost = 2. The optimal gap opening cost was\nset to 4, and the effect of gap opening costs from 1-6 investigated.\nIncongruence length difference values were used to select the preferred\ntree. Data partitions were aligned individually using MAFTT and run in\nTNT with gaps treated as a fifth state, and as missing, and the\nalignments were input in a maximum likelihood analysis. The order Julida\nand the Julidae were monophyletic under all POY settings, and in TNT and\nML analyses. Pteridoiulus was always found to be sister to another\nmonotypic genus, Heteroiulus. The Pteridoiulus+Heteroiulus clade lacks\nmorphological support. The distribution pattern, Pteridoiulus in the\neastern Alps, Heteroiulus in the southern Alps seems unique: similar\npatterns involve pairs of very similar species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myriapoda Parsimony Consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_66972.phy"}]}
