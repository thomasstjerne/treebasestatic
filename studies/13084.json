Here, I apply the baraminological\nmethod called taxon correlation to test for morphological continuity\nwithin and between dinosaurian taxa. The results show enough\nmorphological continuity within Dinosauria to consider most dinosaurs\ngenetically related, even by this creationist standard. A continuous\nmorphological spectrum unites the basal members of Saurischia,\nTheropoda, Sauropodomorpha, Ornithischia, Thyreophora, Marginocephalia,\nand Ornithopoda with Nodosauridae and Pachycephalosauria and with the\nbasal ornithodirans Silesaurus and Marasuchus. Morphological gaps in the\nknown fossil record separate only seven groups from the rest of\nDinosauria. Those groups are Therizinosauroidea + Oviraptorosauria +\nParaves, Tazoudasaurus + Eusauropoda, Ankylosauridae, Stegosauria,\nNeoceratopsia, basal Hadrosauriformes and Hadrosauridae. Each of these\nseven groups exhibits within-group morphological continuity, indicating\ncommon descent for all the group’s members, even according to this\ncreationist standard.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Dinosauria Supertree","ntax":"104","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dinosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"SuperTree","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55363.phy"}]}
