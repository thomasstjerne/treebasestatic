In this\nstudy, we assess the small-scale reproducibility of taxonomic\ncomposition obtained from sequencing four molecular markers\n(mitochondrial 12S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), prokaryote 16S rDNA,\nmitochondrial cox1, and chloroplast trnL intron) from two soil cores\nsampled 10 cm apart. In addition, we sequenced control reactions to\nproduce a contaminant library that was used to filter similar sequences\nfrom sample libraries. Contaminant filtering resulted in the removal of\n1% of reads or 0.3% of operational taxonomic units. We found similar\nrichness, overlap, abundance, and taxonomic diversity from the 12S, 16S,\nand trnL markers from each soil core. Jaccard dissimilarity across the\ntwo soil cores was highest for metazoan taxa detected by the 12S and\ncox1 markers. Taxonomic community distances were similar for each marker\nacross the two soil cores when the Chi squared metric was used, however,\nthe 12S and cox1 markers did not cluster well when the Goodall\nsimilarity metric was used. A comparison of plant macrofossil versus\nread abundance corroborates previous work that suggests eastern Beringia\nwas dominated by grasses and forbs during cold stages of the\nPleistocene, a habitat that is restricted to isolated sites in the\npresent day Yukon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML_bestTree.OUT","ntax":"282","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63178.phy"}]}
