However, identification of Cytospora species is\ndifficult since the currently available DNA sequence data is\ninsufficient. Aside the limited availability of ex-type sequence data,\nmost of the genetic work is only based on the ITS region DNA marker\nwhich lacks the resolution to delineate to the species level in\nCytospora. In this study, three fresh strains were isolated from the\nsymptomatic branches of Elaeagnus angustifolia in Xinjiang Uygur\nAutonomous Region, China. Morphological observation and multi-locus\nphylogenetic analyses (ITS, LSU, ACT and RPB2) support these specimens\nare best accommodated as a distinct novel species of Cytospora.\nCytospora elaeagnicola sp. nov. is introduced, having discoid, nearly\nflat, pycnidial conidiomata with hyaline, allantoid conidia, and differs\nfrom its relatives genetically and by host association.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117178.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"139","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cytospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117179.phy"}]}
