The major lineages within\nthe Diaporthales were determined based on a sequence analysis of the\nlarge subunit (LSU) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA of 83 sequences\nrepresenting 69 taxa. Results suggest the presence of at least six\nlineages within the Diaporthales recognized as the Gnomoniaceae sensu\nstricto, Melanconidaceae sensu stricto, Schizoparme complex including\nthe anamorph genera Coniella and Pilidiella, Cryphonectria-Endothia\ncomplex, Valsaceae, and Diaporthaceae. Six teleomorphic and anamorphic\ntaxa fell within the Diaporthales but were not allied with any of the\nsix major lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_829.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_831.phy"}]}
