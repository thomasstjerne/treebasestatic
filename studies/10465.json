This fungus\ndiffers from previously known Orbilia anamorphs in producing inversely\npyramidal, unicellular conidia with several protuberances at their\ndistal end. Conidia produce from 1-7 prominent denticles that emerge\nfrom a node at the conidiophore apex. Conidiogenesis is holoblastic.\nAmong the isolates some variation in the number of protuberances was\nobserved ranging from 3 to 5 to 7. Based on analyses showing above 90%\nITS similarity, four isolates were treated as a single species. In the\nsequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of\nrDNA, these isolates and other sequences identified as O. aff.\nluteorubella are nested within Orbilia, and clustered a clade supported\nwith a bootstrap of 99. This clade is separated from nematode-trapping\nfungi of Orbilia. Based on both morphological and molecular analyses, we\npropose a new genus, Pseudotripoconidium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 36","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudotripoconidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9029.phy"}]}
