The complex includes six species, most of which are\nassociates of conifer-infesting bark beetles in Europe and North\nAmerica. The aims of this study were to reconsider the delineation of\nthese six species, and to confirm the identity of several additional\nisolates resembling G. olivacea that have emerged from recent surveys in\nPoland, Finland, Russia, Spain and China. Phylogenetic analyses of\nsequence data for five gene regions (ITS2-LSU, actin, β-tubulin, CAL,\nand TEF-1α) distinguished 14 taxa. These included eight known species:\nG. olivacea, G. cucullata, G. davidsonii, G. olivaceapini, G.\nsagmatospora, G. vesca, L. erubescens, and L. francke-grosmanniae. The\nlast one species formed a group that was phylogenetically,\nmorphologically and ecologically distinct from the remaining species in\nthe complex. The recent collections included six new species herein\ndescribed as L. pseudoalbum, L. conplurium, L. pigmentoconidium, L.\npoloniae, L. rhizoidum, and L. breviuscapa. A new combination is\nprovided for L. erubescens, and lectotypes are designated for this\nspecies as well as for G. olivacea and G. sagmatospora. Epitypes were\nalso designated for these three species as well as G. olivaceapini. In\naddition to phylogenetic separation, the synnematous asexual states and\nascomata with almost cylindrical necks and prominent ostiolar hyphae,\ndistinguish the G. olivacea complex from others in Leptographium s. l.\nIt is conceivable that this complex represents a distinct genus in the\nOphiostomatales for which the name Phialographium would be available but\nadditional studies should be undertaken before this issue is\nresolved.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS2LSU MP","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120755.phy"},{"tree_label":"COMBINED BI","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120742.phy"},{"tree_label":"COMBINED ML MEGA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120740.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF BI","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120754.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2LSU BI","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120756.phy"},{"tree_label":"ACT ML MEGA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120743.phy"},{"tree_label":"COMBINED MP","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120741.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF ML MEGA","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120752.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT BI","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120748.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS2LSU ML","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120757.phy"},{"tree_label":"ACT BI","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120745.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAL MP","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120750.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT ML","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120746.phy"},{"tree_label":"ACT MP","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120744.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAL ML","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120749.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT MP","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120747.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAL BI","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120751.phy"},{"tree_label":"TEF MP","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ophiostomatales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120753.phy"}]}
