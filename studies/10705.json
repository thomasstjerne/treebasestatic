Taxa that remained in this\nlarge Province may also have diversified in loco. We analyzed molecular\nmarkers of the genus Microlipophrys (family Blenniidae) that confirm the\nvalidity of this genus and of the seven recognized species.\nMicrolipophrys and its sister clade apparently originated within\nLusitania and dispersed into the tropics at a later stage.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microlipophrys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21074.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAXML 1000 bootstraps","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microlipophrys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21075.phy"},{"tree_label":"Max Parsim 1000 bts","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microlipophrys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21076.phy"}]}
