Although Entoloma includes some sequestrate\nspecies, their origins are not clearly understood in relation to\nphylogenetic position and trophic status. In this study, we collected 34\nsequestrate Entoloma specimens in Japan over a 9-year period. Their\nidentities and phylogenetic positions were determined by molecular\nanalyses using three nuclear loci [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and\nlarge subunit (LSU) regions of rDNA and RNA polymerase II large subunit\n(rpb2) gene]. Based on species delimitation of 97% sequence matches in\nthe ITS region, which is a suitable region for species-level\nidentification of higher fungi, we identified four sequestrate Entoloma\nspecies. Molecular phylogenetic analyses that included all related\nsequences in the international nucleotide sequence database revealed\nthat the four sequestrate Entoloma species belonged to two major\nphylogroups. One of the phylogroups was Inocephalusâ“Cyanula, which is\ncomposed only of saprotrophic species. Three of the Japanese sequestrate\nspecies, as well as three previously known sequestrate species from\nother regions, fell into at least two independent clades in this\nphylogroup, indicating multiple origins of sequestrate forms within this\nsaprotrophic lineage. Another phylogroup, Rhodopoloid, was also shown to\ninclude a sequestrate species for the first time. Because the\nRhodopolioid phylogroup is composed exclusively of mycorrhizal species\n(ectomycorrhizal and tuberculate mycorrhizal species), the sequestrate\nform may also have evolved from a mycorrhizal ancestor. Our results\nsuggest that sequestrate basidiomes have evolved multiple times,\nirrespective of their trophic status in Entoloma. Finally, based on\nmolecular and morphological characteristics, here we describe two new\nsequestrate Entoloma species, i.e. E. prismaticum Sasaki, Kinoshita et\nNara, sp. nov. and E. hypogaeum Sasaki, Kinoshita et Nara, sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S3 BI","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53676.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4 BI","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53677.phy"},{"tree_label":"2gene ML","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53680.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1 ML","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodopoloid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53681.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1 NJ","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodopoloid","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53682.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2 ML","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocephalus Cyanula ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53683.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2 NJ","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocephalus Cyanula NJ","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 ML","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1 BI","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53673.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S3 ML","ntax":"90","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53675.phy"},{"tree_label":"2gene_bayes","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53679.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S4 ML","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_53678.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, 3 loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57307.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 BI","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sequestrate Basidiomes, 3 loci","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57308.phy"}]}
