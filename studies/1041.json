(Asteraceae) are\ntwo Caribbean genera. Rhodogeron is restricted to Cuba, whereas Sachsia\nis found in Cuba, the Bahamas, South Florida and Hispaniola. A\nphylogenetic study of nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast gene ndhF\nand of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal\nDNA shows that these two genera form a monophyletic group. The ndhF\nphylogeny places Rhodogeron and Sachsia within the tribe Plucheeae but\nwith only very weak bootstrap support (59%). The ITS phylogeny indicates\nthe serpentine areas of Cuba are the ancestral habitat for these genera,\nwith a colonization route from Cuba toward the Bahamas and Florida. In\naddition, this study supports previous taxonomic treatments which\nconsidered S. divaricata Griseb. and S. polycephala Griseb. to be\nconspecific. Finally, Rhodogeron is the sister taxon to Sachsia, and we\npropose that it should be maintained as a distinct monospecific\ngenus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodogeron and Sachsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5802.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhodogeron and Sachsia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5803.phy"}]}
