Here we test these results with respect to Polygonum (sensu\nlato) with an expanded dataset, including additional species and gene\nregions. Specifically, we focus on inferring the relationships of\nEupersicaria (Polygonum sect. Persicaria in many prior treatments),\nusing the chloroplast genes rbcL, trnL-F, trnK intron-matK, and\npsbA-trnH IGS, and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences. We conclude that\nEupersicaria is monophyletic and most closely related to Tovara and\nEchinocaulon. In turn, this clade is most closely related to\nCephalophilon. The sister group of this entire Persicaria clade contains\nBistorta and a clade including Aconogonon and Koenigia, which supports\nthe monophyly of the Persicarieae. Within Eupersicaria there appears to\nbe a deep split between P. amphibia and the remaining species, and there\nis strong conflict regarding the placement of P. punctata. These results\nset the stage for a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of\nEupersicaria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig 3 MP","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Persicaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2808.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 ML","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Persicaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2809.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3 BA","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Persicaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2810.phy"}]}
