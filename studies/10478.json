This variability has led to\nconflicting opinions regarding relationships of white-flowered Lomatium\nspecimens from southern Idaho and Oregon allied to L. nevadense and L.\nfoeniculaceum. An initial morphologic study, using morphometric analysis\nand phenetic classification techniques, suggested that these anomalous\nspecimens, generally referred to as L. ravenii, were more closely\nrelated to L. foeniculaceum than to L. nevadense. Phylogenetic analyses\nusing the rps16 intron, ITS, and rpl32-trnLUAG placed five populations\nof the anomalous individuals within a clade including L. ravenii and the\nthreevarieties of L. foeniculaceum. However, two populations collected\nfrom Succor Creek in southeastern Oregon clustered independently of L.\nravenii, suggesting a new cryptic species. Subsequent morphologic\nanalyses revealed differences in morphology between L. ravenii and the\nSuccor Creek populations. We propose a new Succor Creek endemic species,\nL. bentonitum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UNTITLED","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr9293","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_9293.phy"}]}
