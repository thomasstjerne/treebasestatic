Bulldog bats of the genus Noctilio\nare an exemplar lineage, being widely distributed, recently radiated,\nand exhibiting unique feeding ecologies. In addition, currently\nrecognized species are paraphyletic with respect to the mtDNA gene tree\nand contain morphologically identifiable clades that exhibit mtDNA\ndivergences as great as among many species. To test taxonomic hypotheses\nand understand the contribution of hybridization to the extant\ndistribution of genetic diversity in Noctilio, we used phylogenetic,\ncoalescent stochastic modeling, and divergence time estimates using\nsequence data from cytochrome-b, cytochrome c oxidase-I, zinc finger Y,\nand zinc finger X, as well as evolutionary reconstructions based on\namplified fragment length polymorphisms data. No evidence of ongoing\nhybridization between the two currently recognized species was\nidentified. However, signatures of a basal mtDNA capture were recovered\nin which a mtDNA lineage of one species was captured early in the\nNoctilionid radiation. Among subspecific mtDNA clades, which were\ngenerally coincident with morphology and statistically definable as\nspecies, signatures of ongoing hybridization were observed in sex\nchromosome sequences and AFLP. Divergence dating of genetic elements\ncorroborates the diversification of extant Noctilio beginning about\nthree million years ago, with ongoing hybridization between\nmitochondrial lineages separated by 2.5 million years. The time-frame of\nspeciesÂ’ divergence within Noctilio supports that adaptation to the\ndietary strategies of gleaning insects (N. albiventris) or fish (N.\nleporinus) are among the most rapid instances of dietary evolution\nobserved in mammals. In summary, this study illustrates the complex\nevolutionary dynamics shaping gene pools in nature, how comparisons of\ngenetic elements can serve for understanding species boundaries, and the\ncomplex considerations for accurate taxonomic assignment.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ZFY Beast","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61073","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61073.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61079","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cyt-b with Outgroup","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61080","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61080.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI No Outgroup Bayesian Strict Clock","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61081","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61081.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI Maximum Likelihood No Outgroup","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61082","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood ZFX PhyML With Outgroup","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61078","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cyt-b Bayesian Strict Clock No Outgroup","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61083","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cyt-b No Outgroup","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61084","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61084.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI With Outgroup","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61085","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61085.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood ZFY PhyML Outgroup","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61072","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61072.phy"},{"tree_label":"AFLP Bayesian","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61069.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST time scale divergence tree MtDNA","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61071","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61071.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST time scale divergence tree MtDNA","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61070","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61070.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian ZFY No Outgroup _Bayesian Strict Clock","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61075.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61077.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Maximum Likelihood ZFY PhyML No Outgroup","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61074","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61074.phy"}]}
