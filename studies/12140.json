The molecular\nphylogenies, combined with morphological, ecological, and\nbiogeographical data, indicate that Lavatera phoenicea may be a\nbird-pollinated relict of an ancient laurel forest. Lavatera acerifolia,\nhowever, is nested in a derived clade of the Lavatera-Malva taxa from\nthe Mediterranean region, suggesting a more recent introduction into the\nCanary Islands. Incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies\nsuggests that hybridization may have played a role in the evolution of\nL. acerifolia. Several features of L. phoenicea, such as corolla color\nand high nectar production, appear to be plesiomorphic and are still\npresent because of historical constraints. In contrast, woodiness is a\nderived feature that originated as an adaptation to insular\nconditions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lavatera cpDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49775.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lavatera ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49774.phy"}]}
