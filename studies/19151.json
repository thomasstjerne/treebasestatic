In the past, this sectional classification\nwas based on macro- and microscopic characters, and occasionally\nsupplemented with physiological and/or extrolite data. Currently, 25\nsections are accepted, largely based on phylogenetic data. Certain\nsections of subgenus Penicillium were never studied in detail using a\nmultigene sequence approach combined with phenotypic, ecological and\nextrolite data. Based on a combined partial β-tubulin (BenA), calmodulin\n(CaM) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) multigene\nsequence data set, we introduce two new sections (Osmophila and\nRobsamsonia) in subgenus Penicillium and synonymize section Digitata\nwith section Penicillium. The phylogeny correlates well with phenotypic,\nphysiological and ecological data, and some extrolites were diagnostic\nfor certain Penicillium sections. Furthermore, four new species\nbelonging to the newly introduced sections are described using a\npolyphasic approach, including BenA, CaM and RPB2 sequences, macro- and\nmicromorphological data and extrolite profiles. The new section\nRobsamsonia and the new species Penicillium robsamsonii and Penicillium\nsamsonianum were introduced to celebrate Dr. Robert A. Samsons 70th\nbirthday.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95209","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95209.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95210","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95210.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95208","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95208.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95211","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95211.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95215","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95215.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95216","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95216.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95217.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95218","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95218.phy"}]}
