Petota, containing 40 species widely distributed from southern\nMexico to central Bolivia. It contains diploids (2n = 2x = 24),\ntetraploids (2n = 4x = 48) and hexaploids (2n = 6x = 72), and the\nlimited number of species examined have been shown to be allopolyploids.\nPrevious morphological and molecular studies using plastid DNA failed to\ndiscriminate clear species boundaries. Conserved orthologous nuclear DNA\nsequences (COSII) were used to compare the relationships among 72\naccessions from 22 species from series Conicibaccata and 42 additional\naccessions from related series. The results supported previous studies\nshowing the diploid members of series Conicibaccata to be related to\nother South American “clade 4” species, and showed all of the polyploids\nto be allopolyploids among members of clade 4 and other South American\nspecies of “clade 3” (series Piurana and related species). Low bootstrap\nsupport values and morphological similarity suggest recent origins and\nthe need for a reduction in number of recognized species in series\nConicibaccata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP1","ntax":"225","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum Likelihood wild potatoes ser.\nConicibaccata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20665.phy"}]}
