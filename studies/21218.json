Our\nresults show that: (1) the monophyly of the genus is corroborated with\nthe new circumscription of the A. rigida complex; (2) several\nmorphological and phytochemical characters support Amorimia and its two\nmain clades; and (3) these clades can be proposed as new subgenera in\nAmorimia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amorimia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107774.phy"}]}
