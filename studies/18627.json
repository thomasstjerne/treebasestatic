Although the taxonomy of this genus has advanced\nconsiderably in recent years, growth of Schistidium on building surfaces\nis often slow, with the life cycle often incomplete. The availability of\ndiagnostic morphological characters for species identification can\ntherefore be limited; in consequence these building colonisers are often\nassigned to “Schistidium species”. In recent years, DNA barcoding has\nbeen used in studies of species complexes, to aid species delimitation\nand identification. Here we report our first findings of a DNA barcoding\nproject on accessions of European Schistidium that are involved in the\ncolonisation of modern buildings. This study gives an inital insight\ninto the taxonomy of pioneer Schistidium taxa amongst the ‘primary\ngrowth’ on modern building surfaces and an assessment of the utility of\nDNA barcoding for the identification of cryptic, character poor samples\nand species.We show that samples with poor morphological characters due\nto incomplete development from modern building surfaces identified as\n“Schistidium species” fall into several clades, and re-examination of\nthe morphology of these samples shows some morphological differences,\nsuggesting cryptic taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MPT","ntax":"214","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Schistidium tree for Hofbauer et al. paper","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_92308.phy"}]}
