Bayesian analysis and\nMaximum Parsimony were used to simultaneously analyze molecular data\nfrom eight genes (cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase III, 12S RNA, 16S\nRNA, kappa casein, beta spectrin nonerythrocytic 1, protein kinase C\niota, and melanocortin-1 receptor), morphology, behavior, and\nchromosomal rearrangements. With the molecular data set alone, it was\nnot possible to resolve the ingroup topology of Antilopinae; instead a\nbasal polytomy was recovered. The resolution was greatly increased by\nadding data from morphology (mostly skull characters) and behavior to\nthe analysis, establishing a monophyletic group Raphicerini (Ourebia,\nRaphicerus, Madoqua, and Dorcatragus). Root sensitivity of the ingroup\nand effects of long-branch attraction in MP analysis were explored by\nrooting the ingroup with 100 random outgroup taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"pars combined ordered alltaxa MPT1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49589.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined ordered alltaxa MPT2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49590.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined unordered alltaxa MPT1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49592.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined unordered alltaxa MPT2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49593.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined unordered alltaxa MPT3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49594.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined unordered fewtaxa MPT","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49596.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined ordered fewtaxa MPT","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49595.phy"},{"tree_label":"PRCKI","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49583.phy"},{"tree_label":"KCAS","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49581.phy"},{"tree_label":"MC1R","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined ordered fewtaxa","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49576.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucl genes","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49579.phy"},{"tree_label":"mit genes","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49580.phy"},{"tree_label":"cytb","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49585.phy"},{"tree_label":"16S","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49588.phy"},{"tree_label":"pars combined ordered alltaxa MPT3","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49591.phy"},{"tree_label":"cytoxiii","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49586.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined ordered alltaxa","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49574.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined unordered alltaxa","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Combined unordered fewtaxa","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49577.phy"},{"tree_label":"all genes","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49578.phy"},{"tree_label":"SPTBN1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49582.phy"},{"tree_label":"12S","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antilopinae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49587.phy"}]}
