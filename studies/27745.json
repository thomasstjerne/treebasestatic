Since ca 2000, the\nintroduced oomycete Phytophthora ramorum has caused devastating\nepidemics in Europe and North America, spreading as four ancient clonal\nlineages, each of a single mating type, suggesting different\ngeographical origins. We surveyed laurosilva forests for P. ramorum\naround Fansipan mountain on the Vietnam-China border and on Shikoku and\nKyushu islands, southwest Japan. The surveys yielded 71 P. ramorum\nisolates which we assigned to eight new lineages, IC1 to IC5 from\nVietnam and NP1 to NP3 from Japan, based on differences in colony\ncharacteristics, gene x environment responses and multigene phylogeny.\nMolecular phylogenetic trees and networks revealed the eight Asian\nlineages were dispersed across the topology of the introduced European\nand North American lineages. The deepest node within P. ramorum, the\ndivergence of lineages NP1 and NP2, was estimated at 0.5 to 1.6 Myr. The\nAsian lineages were each of a single mating type, and at some locations,\nlineages of “opposite” mating type were present, suggesting\nopportunities for inter-lineage recombination. Based on the high level\nof phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity in the sample populations, the\ncoalescence results and the absence of overt host symptoms, we conclude\nthat P. ramorum comprises many anciently divergent lineages native to\nthe laurosilva forests between eastern Indochina and Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
