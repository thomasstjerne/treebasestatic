Currently, 29 species are recognized within the genus,\nseven of which are present in Paraguay: T. etheridgei, T. torquatus, T.\nguarani, T. lagunablanca, T. spinulosus, T. tarara, and T. teyumirim. We\ngenerated genetic data based on two DNA mitochondrial markers (16S and\nCOI) and one nuclear (PRLR) marker for all the seven Paraguayan species\nwith the goal to identify the taxonomic relationships among taxa based\non the intra- and interspecific genetic variation and the construction\nof molecular clusters. ML and BI analyses match in the recognition of\ntwo main clusters: groups torquatus and spinulosus, and within the\ntorquatus group the differentiation between T. catalanensis and T.\netheridgei is highly supported. Nevertheless, there is a complete lack\nof congruence between mitochondrial and nuclear genes in the topology\nwithin the spinulosus group. Tropidurus guarani and T. spinulosus are\nmore differentiated from the remaining species of the spinulosus group\nwith genetic p-distances from 4.0 to 6.0. Low distances were found\nbetween T. lagunablanca and T. tarara (1.01.1%), and slightly higher,\namong T. teyumirim, T. lagunablanca, and T. tarara (2.02.6%\nrespectively). From a morphological perspective, species of the\nTropidurus torquatus group are easily distinguished; but we found strong\noverlaps of scalation characters in the guarani group. We interpret the\nlow genetic distances documented among the nominal taxa Tropidurus\nlagunablanca, T. tarara, and T. teyumirim as evidence for\nconspecificity. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of\nmorphological characters that would diagnose any of the three taxa.\nSimilarly, we found low genetic distances among populations assigned to\nthe nominal taxa T. guarani and T. spinulosus, including samples from\nnear the type locality of the former, and then we recognize only two\nspecies of the T. spinulosus complex in Paraguay: T. spinulosus and T.\nlagunablanca.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109671.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109669.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109668.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropidurus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109667.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109670.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropidurus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109672.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109664.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropidurus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109663.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109665.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr109666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_109666.phy"}]}
