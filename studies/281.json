In some cases a given\nsporangiophore bears only sporangia or sporangiola. The lateral, fertile\nbranches arose singly, in pairs, or in verticels or pseudoverticels of\nthree to 20. Zygospores were described for the first time for H.\npulchrum. A new genus Kirkia was based on H. cordense, which lacks\nspinelike fertile branches and has an optimal growth temperature of 25 C\nvs slightly below 20 C for species of Helicostylum. A cladistic analysis\nusing representative species of all sporangiate Thamnidiaceae\ndemonstrated that Helicostylum and Kirkia resided in separate clades.\nSelected strains of all species of Helicostylum were included in the\nanalysis. Helicostylum venustellum was considered a synonym of H.\npulchrum. All taxa were illustrated with line drawings. Keys were\nprovided to genera and species, and an extensive list of synonyms was\npresented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thamnidiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1378.phy"}]}
