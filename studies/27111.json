The novel taxon,\nYuxiensis is distinctly characterised by immersed to erumpent,\nsemi-globose ascomata which are not surrounded by any subiculum or\ntomentum, a subcylindrical quellkörper in the centrum, clavate asci with\nlong pedicels and allantoid hyaline ascospores with granular contents.\nMaximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference phylogenetic analyses based on\nLSU, TEF1 and RPB2 sequence data depict a close relationship of the new\ngenus to Pseudocatenomycopsis and Euacanthe, hence, confirming its\nplacement in Scortechiniaceae. Yuxiensis is compared with other genera\nwithin this family using a morpho-phylogenetic approach. Morphological\nillustrations, descriptions and notes are provided for the new\ntaxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126730","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126730.phy"}]}
