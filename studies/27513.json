Although there have been many different\nspecies concepts and methods proposed, researchers generally choose the\nmost appropriate concept according to their interests. However, each\nspecies concept has both advantages and disadvantages. In such cases, an\nintegrated concept based on evidence obtained from different species\nconcepts and methods is suitable for the accurate delimitation of a\nspecies. The biggest dilemma of integrated species delimitation methods\nis the inconsistency between species concepts and methods. Herein, the\nconcurrency of the different concepts and methods was tested to reveal\nthe relationship of the Noccaea densiflora species complex. 2 Bayesian\nmethods, species tree and classification estimation, yarely (STACEY) and\nBayesian phylogenetics and phylogeography (BPP), were examined to infer\nthe species limits of N. densiflora species complex. Nuclear ribosomal\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS), chloroplast trnL-F, and trnQ-5’rps16\nregions were used in the BPP species delimitation program under 3\ndifferent scenarios. ITS and trnL-F regions were used for both the\nSTACEY and TCS haplotype network analyses. In addition to morphological\nmeasurements from different populations and vouchers, specific\nbioclimatic data values were also used for the principal component\nanalysis. Based on all of the analyses, it was determined that only 1\npopulation of N. densiflora and N. microstyla was clearly different,\nwhereas rest of the specimens remain taxonomically uncertain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128369.phy"}]}
