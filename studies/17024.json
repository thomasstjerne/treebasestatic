The absence of host specialization and\nnon-mutualistic relationship with the hosts of locoweed endophytes\nimplicated that their evolution history should be different from other\nendophyte-host associations. Accordingly, the study conducted\nco-evolutionary analyses based on the non-coding chloroplast KGCB region\nof 14 examples of locoweeds and the ITS region of the endophytes\nisolated from them. The results showed that American locoweed endophytes\nhad co-evolution tendency with their hosts, while the Chinese endophytes\nswitched among different hosts, and failed to show a clear\nco-evolutionary pattern. Horizontal transmission behavior could be\napplied to explain the absence of co-evolution for Chinese locoweed\nendophytes, which suggests that Chinese locoweed endophytes might have a\ndifferent association mechanism from the American locoweed\nendophytes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Locoweed fungal endophyte","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85363.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Locoweed fungal endophyte","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85364.phy"}]}
