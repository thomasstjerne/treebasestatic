However, this prediction has yet\nto be tested in a broad evolutionary context in many diverse clades,\nincluding ants. Here, we reconstruct an expanded ant phylogeny\nrepresenting 82% of ant genera, compile a new family-wide trait\ndatabase, and conduct various trait-based analyses to show that\ndefensive traits in ants do exhibit an evolutionary trade-off. In\nparticular, the use of a functional sting negatively correlates with a\nsuite of other defensive traits including spines, large eye size, and\nlarge colony size. Furthermore, we find that several of the defensive\ntraits that trade off with a sting are also positively correlated with\neach other and drive increased diversification, further suggesting that\nthese traits form a defensive suite. Our results support the hypothesis\nthat trade-offs in defensive traits significantly constrain trait\nevolution and influence species diversification in ants.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"291","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ants: Maximum Clade Credibility With 291 Tips","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99625.phy"}]}
