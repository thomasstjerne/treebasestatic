The main aim of the present\nstudy was to investigate the intergenic spacer (IGS) rDNA region of a\nrepresentative collection of 31 P. italicum strains and compare its\nstructure with that of closest related species, P. alvesii and P.\nrubrigenum. The structural analysis of the IGS sequences allowed to\nidentify five categories of repeat elements organized in distinct\npatterns. The morphological and microscopic analysis performed on all P.\nitalicum strains provided a description upgrated of P. italicum.\nPhylogenetic tree constructed on IGS sequences and compared with that\nobtained by combined analysis of β-tubulin and actin sequences\ndemonstrated that the IGS rDNA region could be a useful marker to\ndistinguish both intraspecific and interspecific variations, although\nfurther molecular studies are needed to confirm if this region can help\nto prevent the misidentifications and the introduction of vague species\nboundaries in the Phaeoacremonium genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Parsimonious tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_132016.phy"}]}
