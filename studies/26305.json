During a survey of fungi in six nature reserves in Guizhou\nprovince of China, twenty one Diaporthe isolates were collected from\ndifferent woody hosts. Based on morphology, culture characteristics and\nmolecular phylogenetic analysis, these isolates were characterized.\nPhylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer region (ITS),\ncombined with translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF), Î²-tubulin\n(TUB) and calmodulin (CAL) genes identified six known Diaporthe species\nand seven distinct lineages representing new Diaporthe species. The\ndetails of six known species: Diaporthe cercidis, D. cinnamomi, D.\nconica, D. nobilis, D. pascoei and D. sackstonii are given and the seven\nnew species D. constrictospora, D. ellipsoidea, D. guttulata, D.\nirregularis, D. lenispora, D. minima, D. minuscula are described and\nillustrated. Among the 21 isolates, D. minima was the dominant species,\naccounting for 20% of the frequency of occurrence. This study revealed a\nhigh diversity of previously undescribed Diaporthe species associated\nwith woody hosts in various nature reserves of Guizhou province,\nindicating that there is a potential of Diaporthe species remains to be\ndiscovered in this unique landform (Karst formations) in Guizhou\nprovince, China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125803.phy"}]}
