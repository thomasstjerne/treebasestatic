The aim of this study was to\nisolate, identify and characterize the culturable mycobiota associated\nwith Flabellia petiolata, a green alga frequently retrievedin the\nMediterranean basin.Twenty algal thalliwere collected from two different\nsampling sites in the Mediterranean Sea (Elba Island, Italy). A\npolyphasic approach showed the presence of a relevant alga-associated\nmycobiota with 64 taxa identified.The fungal isolates belonged mainly to\nAscomycota (61 taxa), while only three Basidiomycota were detected. The\nphylogenetic position of sterile mycelia and cryptic taxa,inferred on\nthe basis of LSU partial region,highlighted the presence of putative new\nphylogenetic lineages within Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes. This\nwork represents the first quali-quantitative analysis of the culturable\nmycobiota associated to a green alga in the Mediterranean Sea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101559","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101559.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101555","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101555.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101557","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101557.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101639","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101639.phy"}]}
