Much of what we know about ecological opportunity,\nand the larger process of adaptive radiation, is derived from vertebrate\ndiversification on islands. Here, we examine lineage diversification in\nthe turtle ants (Cephalotes), a species-rich group of ants that has\ndiversified throughout the Neotropics. We show that crown group turtle\nants originated during the Eocene (46 mya), coincident with global\nwarming and the origin of many other clades. We also show a marked\nlineage-wide slowdown in diversification rates in the Miocene.\nContrasting this overall pattern, a species group associated with the\nyoung and seasonally harsh Chacoan biogeographic region underwent a\nrecent burst of diversification. Subsequent analyses also indicated that\nthere is significant phylogenetic clustering within the Chacoan region,\nand that speciation rates are highest there. Together, these findings\nsuggest that recent ecological opportunity, from successful colonization\nof novel habitat, may have facilitated renewed turtle ant\ndiversification. Our findings highlight a central role of ecological\nopportunity within a successful continental radiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"molecular only","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalotes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68862.phy"},{"tree_label":"morphological only","ntax":"119","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalotes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68863.phy"},{"tree_label":"fossil calibration","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalotes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68864.phy"},{"tree_label":"molecular allinds","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalotes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68865.phy"},{"tree_label":"molecular morphological tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cephalotes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68866.phy"}]}
