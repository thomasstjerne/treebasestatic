Both species were\ncharacterized mainly by having conidiophores more or less erect, mostly\nbranched, with branch bearing whorls of acicular phialides. In addition,\none of these species, Acremonium chlamydosporum, produced abundant\nchlamydospores and globose rough-walled conidia. The other species,\nAcremonium variecolor, produced a brownish diffusible pigment and\nsmooth, subglobose with apiculate base conidia; sessile conidia growing\ndirectly from vegetative hyphae were also present The analysis of the\nsequences of the ITS region, the D1-D2 domains of the 28S rRNA gene and\na fragment of the actin gene revealed their relationships with members\nof the Hypocreales and demonstrated their genetic differences with\nmorphologically similar species","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acremonium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_85678.phy"}]}
