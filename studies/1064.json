The fungus was identified\nas Cryptovalsa ampelina based on its characteristic morphology.\nSubsequent phylogenetic analyses confirmed this species to belong to the\nDiatrypaceae. To elucidate its status as potential pathogen,\npathogenicity was also confirmed by means of wound inoculations on\ngrapevine canes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryptovalsa ampelina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5820.phy"}]}
