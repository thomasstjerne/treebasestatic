A combined data set of nuclear ribosomal ITS and LSU sequences\nwas used to infer phylogenetic relationships of Parasola species and\nseveral outgroup taxa. Clades recovered in the phylogenetic analyses\ncorresponded well to morphologically discernable species, although in\nthe case of P. lilatincta, P. leiocephala and P. plicatilis amended\nconcepts proved necessary. Parasola galericuliformis and P. hemerobia\nare shown to be synonymous with P. leiocephala and P. plicatilis,\nrespectively. By mapping morphological characters on the phylogeny, it\nis shown that the emergence of deliquescent Parasola taxa was\naccompanied by the development of pleurocystidia, brachybasidia and a\nplicate pileus. Spore shape and the position of the germ pore on the\nspores showed definite evolutionary trends within the group: from\nellipsoid the former becomes more voluminous and heart-shaped, the\nlatter evolves from the centre to eccentric in taxa referred to as \u001acrown\u001a\nParasola species. The results are discussed and compared to other\nCoprinus sensu lato and Psathyrella taxa. Homoplasy and phylogenetic\nsignificance of various morphological characters, as well as indels in\nITS and LSU sequences, are also evaluated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS LSU","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Coprinoid Mushroom Genus Parasola","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5434.phy"}]}
