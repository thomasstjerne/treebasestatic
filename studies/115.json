Cladistic analysis of the data,\nincluding evaluation of all equally or almost equally parsimonious\ncladograms, shows that much homoplasy (parallelisms and reversals) is\npresent and that few or no well supported monophyletic groups of\nfamilies can be demonstrated. In one analysis of nine angiosperm\nfamilies and 40 variable amino acid positions from three proteins, the\nmost parsimonious cladograms were 151 steps long and contained 63\nparallelisms and reversals (consistency index = 0.583). In another\nanalysis of six families and 53 variable amino acid positions from four\nproteins, the most parsimonious cladogram was 161 steps long and\ncontained 50 parallelisms and reversals (consistency index = 0.689).\nSingle changes in both data matrices could yield most parsimonious\ncladograms with quite different topologies and without common\nmonophyletic groups. Presently, amino acid sequence data are not\ncomprehensive enough for phylogenetic reconstruction among angiosperms.\nMore informative positions are needed, either from sequencing longer\nparts of the proteins or from sequencing more proteins from the same\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_625.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_626.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8A","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_627.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8B","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_628.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5D","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5C","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1538.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperm","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1534.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1535.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1536.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"angiosperms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1537.phy"}]}
