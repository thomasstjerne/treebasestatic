These are briefly described, given informal clade names, and\ncompared with the groups recognized by previous Solanum workers.\nNon-molecular synapomorphies are proposed for many of the clades.\nContinued use of informal taxonomic designations is advocated for new\ninfrageneric groups within Solanum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"one mp tree","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4025.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict consensus","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4026.phy"}]}
