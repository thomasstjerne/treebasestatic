Morphological studies in\nthe past indicated that Phanerochaete is a heterogeneous assemblage of\nspecies. In this study the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of\nthe nuclear ribosomal DNA was used to test the monophyly of the genus\nPhanerochaete and to infer phylogenetic relationships of the 24 taxa\nstudied. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses do\nnot support the monophyly of the genus. However, a core group of species\nrepresented by Phanerochaete velutina, P. chrysosporium, P. sordida, P.\nsanguinea and others are closely related and group together in a clade.\nOther common Phanerochaete species including Phanerochaete rimosa, P.\nchrysorhiza, P. omnivora, P. avellanea, P. tuberculata, P. flava, and P.\nallantospora, however, do not cluster with the core Phanerochaete\ngroup.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1260.phy"}]}
