The phylogenetic relationships of these species were determined\nusing sequences from the ITS and IGS region of the nuclear rRNA gene\ncomplex, two nuclear genes [Î²-tubulin (benA) and RNA polymerase II\nsecond largest subunit (rpb2)] and two mitochondrial genes [small rRNA\nsubunit (rns) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1)] and, where\navailable, related sequences from databases. The morphological\ncharacters of the anamorphs and teleomorphs, and the single gene\nphylogenetic trees, differentiated and placed the species examined in\nthe well-supported sections of Aenei, Aspergillus, Bispori, Candidi,\nCircumdati, Clavati, Cremei, Flavi, Flavipedes, Fumigati, Nidulantes,\nNigri, Restricti, Terrei, Usti and Zonati, with few uncertainties. The\ncombined use of the three commonly employed nuclear genes (benA, rpb2\nand ITS), the IGS region, and two less often used mitochondrial gene\nsequences (rns and cox1) as a single unit, resolved several taxonomic\nambiguities. A phylogenetic tree was inferred using Neighbour-Joining,\nMaximum Parsimony and Bayesian methods. The strains examined formed\nseven well-supported clades within the genus Aspergillus. Altogether,\nthe concatenated nuclear and mitochondrial sequences offer additional\ntools for an improved understanding of phylogenetic relationships within\nthis genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"225","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus igs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50051.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"257","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus benA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61066.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61065.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S2","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus cox1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50047.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus nms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50048.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aspergillus concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_61068.phy"}]}
