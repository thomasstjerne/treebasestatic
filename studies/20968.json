The taxa collected in\nthe present study were from unidentified submerged twigs in a stream in\nPrachuap Khiri Khan and Phang Nga Provinces, Thailand and Guizhou\nProvince, China. Morphological examination and phylogenetic analyses\nprovide evidence for several taxonomic novelties, including a new genus\n(Pseudostanjehughesia) and five novel species (Distoseptispora\nguttulata, D. phangngaensis, D. suoluoensis, Pseudostanjehughesia\naquitropica and Sporidesmium gyrinomorphum). The collections also\ncomprised three previously described species (Distoseptispora\nmultiseptata, Sporidesmium thailandense and S. tropicale). Descriptions\nand illustrations of the above taxa are provided and their systematic\nplacement is discussed. The description of Distoseptispora is\nemended.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"125","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sporidesmium-like LSU SSU TEF1a RPB2 ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112349.phy"}]}
