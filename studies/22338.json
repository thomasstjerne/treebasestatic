This result\nsupports a hypothesis by previous studies that A. auricula-judae s. str.\nis distributed only in Europe. Twenty-six samples including specimens\nconsidered as A. polytricha were identified as A. cornea, and A.\npolytricha and A. nigricans were not found. This result suggests that A.\ncornea are included in fungi that have been considered as A. polytricha\nin Japan.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Auricularia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_112490.phy"}]}
