Both species are characterized by morphology of sexual and\nasexual morphs and by DNA data. They have olivaceous to green-brown\nmuriform ascospores and are closely related to T. asturiensis and T.\nroseovirens, as determined by multigene phylogenetic analyses of a\nmatrix containing six loci (ITS and 28S regions of nuc rDNA, ACT1, RPB1,\nRPB2, TEF1 and TUB2 genes). We also report that Cucurbitaria bicolor is\na synonym of Thyronectria rhodochlora, the type species of\nThyronectria.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thyronectria ITS, nuc 28S rDNA, ACT, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1,\nTUB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_88910.phy"}]}
