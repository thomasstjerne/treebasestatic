Spencermartinsia westrale W.M. Pitt, J.R. Úrbez-Torres\n& Trouillas sp. nov. is closely related to the generic type,\nSpencermartinsia viticola (A.J.L. Phillips and J. Luque) A.J.L.\nPhillips, A. Alves & Crous, but is morphologically and\nphylogenetically distinct. Two further species, Dothiorella neclivorem\nW.M. Pitt & J.R. Úrbez-Torres and Dothiorella vinea-gemmae W.M. Pitt\n& J.R. Úrbez-Torres are similarly described here as new, following\nre-examination of strains from existing collections. Both species bore\nconidia that were brown and one-septate prior to release from\nconidiogenous cells and in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of the\nITS and TEF regions, both were found to occupy distinct sub-clades\nwithin the genus, separate from other presently accommodated species.\nSpencermartinsia plurivora Abdollahz., Javadi & A.J.L. Phillips, and\na fourth, currently unnamed Dothiorella species, both originating from\ngrapevines in South Australia are also reported for the first time in\nAustralia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia MP tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75745.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJ Tree","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia NJ tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75746.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothiorella and Spencermartinsia BI tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75747.phy"}]}
