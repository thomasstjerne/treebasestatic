This\ncosmopolitan fungus is well known for its ability to colonize a high\nnumber of plants as both a pathogen and an endophyte. Thus, the shift\nfrom this general habit to a lifestyle involving a strict symbiotic\nrelationship with an insect introduces expectancy for possible strain\nspecialization which could reflect separated phylogenetic lineages.\nWithin the ongoing taxonomic revision concerning species of\nBotryosphaeria, we evaluated the phylogenetic relationships among\nstrains recovered from Asphondylia galls collected on several species of\nLamiaceae in Poland and in Italy, and all the currently accepted species\nin this genus. A number of strains previously characterized from gall\nsamples from Australia and South Africa, whose genetic marker sequences\nare deposited in GenBank, were also included in the analysis. As a\nresult, full identity as B. dothidea is confirmed for our isolates,\nwhile strains from the southern hemisphere grouped separately,\nindicating some extent of genetic variation related to the geographic\norigin in the association with gall midges.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria ITS+TEF MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_125081.phy"}]}
