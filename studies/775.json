The outstanding\nmorphological characteristics of this species are its robust, dense\npenicilli bearing long, broad columns of conidia, and its smooth-walled,\nunflanged ascospores which are produced within 3 wk of inoculation onto\nMEA. The new species produces penicillic acid, a fumagillin-like\nmolecule, patulodin-like compounds CK2108A and CK2108B, and a compound\nresembling 2-[(2-hydroxypropionyl)amino]benzamide. Phylogenetic analysis\nusing 1100 bases of the ITS and LSU DNA regions indicates that E.\nbovifimosum is most closely related to E. baarnense, and also to E.\ncrustaceum, E. egyptiacum, and E. tularense.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eupenicillium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5612.phy"}]}
