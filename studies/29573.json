CLB can be caused by different\nCalonectria species, and previous studies have indicated that\nCalonectria might have high species diversity in Brazil. During a\ndisease survey conducted in three commercial plantations of Eucalyptus\nin northeastern Brazil, diseased leaves from Eucalyptus trees with\ntypical symptoms of CLB were collected, and Calonectria fungi were\nisolated. Based on phylogenetic analyses of six gene regions (act, cmdA,\nhis3, rpb2, tef1, and tub2) and morphological characteristics, these\nisolates were identified as two new species of Calonectria and named Ca.\nparagominensis sp. nov. and Ca. imperata sp. nov.; both species are\npathogenic to Eucalyptus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136116","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_136116.phy"}]}
