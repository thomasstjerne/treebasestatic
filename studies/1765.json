All trees showed that NJM0034\nand NJM0131 were branched before separation of the two main saprolegnian\nand peronosporalean clades. This data suggests that the clear\nphylogenetic separation of those marine oomycete endoparasites from the\ntwo main oomycete clades. Excepting LSU rRNA gene tree, NJM0034 and\nHaliphthoros spp. did not form a monophyletic group. On the other hand,\nH. milfordensis NJM0131 clustered with H. philippinensis SANK 15178, not\nwith H. milfordensis NJM9434 in COII amino acid tree. This result\nstrongly suggests that a taxonomical re-investigation of the genus\nHaliphthoros should be considered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haliphthoros-like marine oomycetes, SSU rDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_516.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haliphthoros-like marine oomycetes, COX2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2690.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haliphthoros-like marine oomycetes, LSU rDNA tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2689.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haliphthoros-like marine oomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2691.phy"}]}
