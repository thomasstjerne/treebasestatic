Here, we\nreconstructed phylogenetic relationships among all 706 families of land\nplants using molecular data. We dated the phylogeny using multiple\nfossils and molecular clock techniques. Applying various tests of\ndiversification that take into account topology, branch length, numbers\nof extant species as well as extinction, we evaluated diversification\nrates through time. We also compared these diversification profiles\nagainst the distribution of the climate modes of the Phanerozoic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"200Boot ML","ntax":"699","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Land Plants: rbcL, atpB and rps4 genes, 18S and\n26S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51868.phy"}]}
