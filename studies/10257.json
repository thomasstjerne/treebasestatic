Calonectria pseudoreteaudii resides in the Ca. reteaudii\ncomplex and Ca. cerciana is closely related to Ca. morganii. Connected\nto the discovery of Ca. pseudoreteaudii, species in the Ca. reteaudii\ncomplex were re-considered and the group is shown to accommodate two\ncryptic species. These are provided with the names Ca. queenslandica sp.\nnov. and Ca. terrae-reginae sp. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria reteaudii combined tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6877.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria morganii combined tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6767.phy"}]}
