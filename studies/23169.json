Heenan & Smissen\n(Nothofagaceae)) form ectomycorrhizal associations. We investigated the\nextent to which canopy ectomycorrhizal communities contribute to overall\ndiversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with silver beech. Hyphal\ningrowth bags were buried for 12 months in canopy and terrestrial soils\nof five trees at one site. We used amplicon sequencing of the internal\ntranscribed spacer 2 region to assess diversity of ectomycorrhizal\nfungal species. There was no significant difference in ectomycorrhizal\ncommunity diversity between the terrestrial and canopy hyphal ingrowth\nbag communities, but the canopy community composition was significantly\ndifferent to the terrestrial community composition. Several abundant\nectomycorrhizal species were significantly more represented in the\nterrestrial soil than the canopy soil. Non-ectomycorrhizal (termed\n“residual”) fungi in the terrestrial hyphal ingrowth bags were\nsignificantly more diverse than those in the canopy soil, and many\nspecies were significantly more represented in either the terrestrial or\ncanopy communities. The canopy soil microhabitat provides a novel\nenvironment for growth of ectomycorrhizal adventitious roots and enables\nthe physical partitioning of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity in the\nforest.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113233","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113233.phy"}]}
