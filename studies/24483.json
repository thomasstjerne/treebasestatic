Garganicae\nrepresented by species of prevalent Adriatic and Ionian distribution, a\nrare new endemic species named C. cremnophila is described and\nillustrated from Peljeac peninsula and the nearby Elaphite islands of\nOlipa and Jakljan (southern Croatia). It is a chasmophyte growing on\ncalcareous rocky crevices near the sea, showing closer relationship with\nC. garganica from southern Italy. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear\nITS and chloroplast trnLtrnF data emphasized that C. cremnophila is\ndistinct from other species of this group, forming a subclade with C.\ngarganica and C. poscharskyana. The morphology, SEM microstructure of\nseeds and pollen grains, taxonomical relationships, ecology,\nconservation status of C. cremnophila, as well as an identification key\nincluding the species of the ser. Garganicae are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanula cremnophila","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118759.phy"}]}
