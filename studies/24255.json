In this paper, six new\nspecies from central Vietnam, T. albidomarginata, T. brevisterigmata, T.\ncinereobrunnea, T. longiechinula, T. stipitobasidia and T. verrucospora,\nwere described and illustrated based on morphological characteristics\nand molecular phylogenetic analyses of nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions\ncombined with nuc 28S rDNA regions. All species can be recognized by a\ncombination of morphological features and anatomical characteristics.\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses with maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nanalysis confirm the phylogenetic positions for these new species. New\nspecies and closely related species in the phylogenetic tree are\ndiscussed, and a key to species of Tomentella in Vietnam was\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"195","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121611","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121611.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"195","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121612","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121612.phy"}]}
