Morphological characterization and phylogenetic analysis,\nusing combined LSU, SSU and ITS sequence data, showed them to be related\nto other Phomatospora species in a distinct clade in Sordariomycetes.\nThe Phomatospora species clustered in three clades, including P.\nviticola in Phomatospora sensu stricto, Lanspora coronata, and the new\ngenus Tenuimurus. These new taxa together with Lanspora coronata and\nother Phomatospora species form a distinct clade which we introduce as a\nnew family Phomatosporaceae and a new order Phomatosporales, which is\nsister to the order Amplistromatales. The new genus and species are\nintroduced and compared.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100596.phy"}]}
