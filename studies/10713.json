Hyaloperonospora praecox is described and\nillustrated as a new species, and detailed descriptions and\nillustrations including the diagnostic disease symptoms, haustoria and\noogonia are provided for H. erophilae for the first time. Based on\nmorphological and ITS sequence data, Peronospora drabae-majusculae is\nsynonymised with H. erophilae. Hyaloperonospora praecox differs from H.\nerophilae by pyriform haustoria, by non-systemic infection combined with\ninconspicuous infection symptoms, and by slightly larger conidia. Both\nspecies were observed on Draba verna sensu stricto and Draba boerhaviae,\nand do not show a host preference. Molecular and morphological evidence\nis presented that H. erophilae and H. praecox can co-occur in the same\nhost population.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hyaloperonospora praecox","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48848.phy"}]}
