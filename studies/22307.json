Rust galls bearing aecial infections and relating uredinial\nand telial infections on the leaves of nine Vachellia species not\npreviously recorded to be infected by Ravenelia spp. have recently been\ncollected in South Africa. The rust fungi causing these infections were\ncharacterized using molecular phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data\nof the LSU and ITS rDNA regions as well as morphological examinations.\nThe host range of R. macowaniana and R. evansii was thus re-assessed and\nextended from two to eight species and from one to three species,\nrespectively. The application of Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of\ntelial morphological characters provided evidence of an effect of the\nhost species on the teliospore morphology in R. evansii, but only a\nminor effect in R. macowaniana. A novel gall-inducing Ravenelia sp. was\nfound on Vachellia xanthophloea and it is described here as R.\nxanthophloeae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110210","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110210.phy"}]}
