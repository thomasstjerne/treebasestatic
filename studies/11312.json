Despite Powellomyces-like chytrids being commonly\nobserved in gross culture, the genus contained only two species. To\ndetermine diversity in this group, I amassed 49 isolates of\nPowellomyces-like chytrids, including the cultures upon which species\ntypes were based and new isolates from pollen-baited water cultures of\nsoils, plant detritus, and manure. I sequenced portions of nucSSU and\nnucLSU rDNA regions and the EF-1Î±-like gene from each isolate to produce\na molecular phylogeny. This phylogeny supports monophyly of\nspizellomycetalean chytrids with exogenous development and suggests that\nmultiple distinct lineages exist within this group. This phylogeny,\nalong with a reevaluation of the ultrastructural features of the two\ndescribed species, supports the recognition of a new family\nPowellomycetaceae and genus Geranomyces, which contains 31 isolates of\nG. variabilis comb. nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr31330","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_31330.phy"}]}
