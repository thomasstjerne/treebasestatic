The\n.Documenting bryophyte diversification patterns and macroevolutionary\nhistory has been challenged by the scarcity of fossils and the lack of a\ngeneral phylogenetic framework. Here, we dated the phylogenies of\nmosses, liverworts and hornworts from the most comprehensive taxon and\ncharacter sampling to date to demonstrate that overall estimates of net\nspecies diversification are slightly less than twice lower than those\nreported in ferns and about three to four times lower than those\ndescribed for angiosperms. Statistical rate analyses showed that mosses\nand liverworts underwent a burst of diversification since the\nmid-Mesozoic. The diversification rates further increased in specific\nlineages towards the Cenozoic. Our findings indicate that bryophytes,\nalthough accumulating diversity at a globally lower rate than other land\nplants, are still actively diversifying.","trees":[{"tree_label":"calibrationI geological era","ntax":"477","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75504.phy"},{"tree_label":"calibrationI max 815Ma","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liverworts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75503.phy"},{"tree_label":"calibrationI max 475Ma","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liverworts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75502.phy"},{"tree_label":"calibrationI geological era","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liverworts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75501.phy"},{"tree_label":"calibrationI max 475Ma","ntax":"477","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75505.phy"},{"tree_label":"calibrationI max 815Ma","ntax":"477","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mosses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75506.phy"}]}
