This work compares the effect of several modern\nnucleotide alignment strategies, including those making use of structure\ndata, on phylogenetic inference. From both the phylogenetic analyses and\ncomparative secondary structure, implications for taxonomy and evolution\nof puffball fungi are discussed. Lycoperdaceae remain insufficiently\nresolved with present taxon and data sampling. Neither alignment allows\nstatistically robust phylogenetic hypotheses under any current\noptimality criterion. The secondary structure data at this time are best\nused as accessory taxonomic characters as their phylogenetic resolving\npower and confidence in validity is limited compared to underlying\nnucleotide characters. We introduce a preliminary nomenclature\nconvention to describe secondary structure for defining consensus\nfeatures. These consensus structures are illustrated for the clades\n/Calvatia, /Handkea-Echinatum, /Vascellum, /Morganella, and\n/Plumbea-Paludosa (Bovista).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lycoperdaceae MP Jackknife","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2926.phy"}]}
