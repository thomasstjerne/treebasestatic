Fragments of 21 genes were examined from\nplants of 15 species representing 11 of the 17 genera in the family and\nseven of the eight tribes (the newly proposed Gongylocarpeae was not\nstudied). Maximum likelihood analysis provided a phylogenetic tree with\n100% bootstrap support for all but one of the clades that indicate\ntribal relationships, and corroborated results of recent studies based\non chloroplast genes and nuclear ITS sequences. PgiC appears to have a\ngreater rate of divergence than the chloroplast genes and provides much\nphylogenetically useful data. Two PgiC genes were found in each of the\ntwo species sampled in Epilobium; they formed two sister clades, with\neach species having one gene of each type, showing that the species\ndescended from a single ancestral tetraploid. The two species (E.\nbrachycarpum and E. canum) are not closely related, and previous studies\nshowed that the smallest clade including both contained six of the seven\nsections of Epilobium. Thus, all species of Epilobium except those in\nsection Epilobium (which was not studied) share a common tetraploid\norigin, refuting the “Stebbins/Raven” model of the origin of tetraploidy\nin this genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Onagraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2616.phy"}]}
