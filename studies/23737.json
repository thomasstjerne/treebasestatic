Twelve new\nspecies, eight in Leucoagaricus (La. bulbiger, La. caeruleovertens, La.\nmargaritifer, La. pegleri, La. roseovertens, La. silvestris, La.\nstillatus, La. turgipes) and four in Leucocoprinus (Lc. antillarum, Lc.\nfuligineopunctatus, Lc. microlepis, Lc. scissus) are described.\nAdditional records of previously described taxa are also discussed,\nincluding the first molecularly annotated occurrences of Lepiota\nguatopoensis, Lepiota mucrocystis, and La. rubroconfusus in their\nputative natural habitats and of Lc. cretaceus in the neotropics.\nLepiota guatopoensis and Lepiota mucrocystis are transferred here to\nLeucoagaricus based on their phylogenetic placement and morphological\ncharacteristics. Color photographs of fresh basidiocarps and line\ndrawings of microscopic characters are provided for all species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"431","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133937.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"431","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133938.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"431","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133935.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"431","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leucoagaricus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133936.phy"}]}
