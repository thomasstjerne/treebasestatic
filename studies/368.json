A\nnested, global outgroup analysis was performed by including\nrepresentatives of three other sections of Columnea and two species each\nof the closely related genera Alloplectus and Drymonia. Twenty\ncharacters were scored as binary, and thirteen were scored as\nmulti-state. All characters scored were qualitative. Because of the high\nlevels of homoplasy in the Gesneriaceae, simple characters were not\nfound to be useful and more complex characters comprising several simple\ncharacters were necessary to provide resolution. The data were analyzed\nusing Wagner parsimony, resulting in eight most parsimonious trees. In\ngeneral, the phylogeny was congruent with current classification schemes\nand phylogenies derived from molecular data and combined molecular and\nmorphological data. However, several phylogenetic relationships that\nresult from the analysis of morphological data are suspect based on\nother data. The monophyly of Alloplectus is not supported solely with\nmorphological data, although other data support its monophyly.\nInferences regarding the biogeographic history and evolution of Columnea\nsections Pentadenia and Stygnanthe indicate a southern Andean origin for\nthe genus Columnea with a subsequent migration and radiation\nnorthward.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Columnea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3253.phy"}]}
