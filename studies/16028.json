Based on a recent fresh collection from southwestern China,\nan exhaustive macroâ and micromorphological description is provided and\nsupported by molecular analysis (nrITS and nrLSU sequences). Color\npictures of both fresh basidiomes in habitat and dried material along\nwith line drawings of the main anatomical features and a comprehensive\nphylogram are provided, supported by comparative notes on lookalike and\nclosely related species. Original materials of the Chinese T.\nmicrosporus and T. plumbeoviolaceoides were successfully sequenced and a\ntype revision of T. microsporus is presented. Based on molecular\ninference the holotype of T. microsporus is conspecific with Japanese\nsamples of T. neofelleus and must be considered a posterior synonym.\nPhylogenetic data also demonstrate evidence for the presence of T.\nneofelleus in China and for a separation from the allied Chinese taxon\nT. plumbeoviolaceoides. Furthermore, morphological differences separate\nT. neofelleus from all other unsequenced species of the same\nconsortium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"LSU","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tylopilus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75825.phy"}]}
