During our\ninvestigation of fungi associated with leaf spot diseases in northern\nand northwestern Iran, several Septoria isolates were recovered from\nsymptomatic leaves on different herbaceous and woody plants in the\nAsteraceae, Betulaceae and Salicaceae families. These isolates were\nstudied by applying a polyphasic approach including morphological and\ncultural data, and a multi-gene phylogeny using a combined dataset of\npartial sequences of the 28S nuc rRNA gene (LSU), internal transcribed\nspacer regions and intervening 5.8S nuc rRNA gene (ITS) of the nuc rDNA\noperon, actin (actA), translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1),\ncalmodulin (cmdA), β-tubulin (tub2) and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II\nsecond largest subunit (rpb2). Four novel species are proposed, namely\nSeptoria eclipticola on Eclipta prostrata, Septoria firouraghina on\nCirsium arvense, Septoria guilanensis on Populus deltoides, and Septoria\ntaleshana on Alnus subcordata. All species are illustrated and their\nmorphology and phylogenetic relationships with other Septoria species\nare discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Septoria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_116857.phy"}]}
