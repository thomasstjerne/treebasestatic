Sequence\ndata from the entire mitochondrial cytochrome-b (1,143 bp), a portion of\nexon 1 of the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (1,266\nbp), and intron 2 of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (580 bp) genes were\nanalyzed using phylogenetic methods (maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference). In the cytochrome-b analysis, individuals recognized as O.\npalustris and O. couesi formed reciprocally monophyletic clades\nsupporting their recognition as species; however, additional\nphylogenetically informative phylogroups were present within each of the\n2 nominate clades. In addition, levels of genetic divergence within the\ncurrently recognized taxa exceeded values normally associated with\nintra-species variation. Together, the phylogenetic and genetic\ndivergence data imply that consideration should be given to recognizing\n4 additional species in this complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oryzomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6532.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oryzomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6549.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oryzomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6239.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oryzomys","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6307.phy"}]}
