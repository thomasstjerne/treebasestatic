However, no sequence data are currently\navailable for this species. Based on molecular phylogenetic results\nobtained from complete SSU and partial LSU data, we show that the genus\nCymadothea belongs to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Capnodiales,\nDothideomycetes). This is the first report of sequences obtained for an\nobligate biotrophic member of Mycosphaerellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Unpublished NJ with K2p","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae, NJ Kimura 2-params","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6611.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished NJ with HKY85","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae, NJ with HKY85","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6391.phy"},{"tree_label":"Unpublished NJ with uncorrected","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae, NJ uncorrected P","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6485.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae, 1 of 141 MPTs SSU, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6454.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mycosphaerellaceae, 50% maj rule of 7811 MB trees","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5993.phy"}]}
