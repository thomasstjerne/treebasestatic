The incidence and the severity of the\ndisease were recorded. Colletotrichum asianum were isolated from the\nsymptomatic fruits. Identification of the fungi was based on\nmorphological characteristic and multilocus phylogenetic analysis. Mango\ncv. Manalagi was chosen to arrange a pathogenicity test. The isolates\ncaused rotting symptomp on the fruit. They were re-isolated from the\nsymptomatic fruits to fullfill KochÂ’s postulates. This study represents\nthe new record of mango anthracnose and the first proof of C. asianum\nassociated with mango anthracnose in Indonesia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123211","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123211.phy"}]}
