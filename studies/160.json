Its distinctness and phylogenetic placement\nare substantiated by phenetic analysis of morphological features, field\nstudy of variability in natural populations, survey of leaf essential\noils, SEM study of anther micromorphology, preliminary investigation of\npollination biology, garden observations, and a revised cladistic\nanalysis of the genus. The discovery of D. christmanii is indicative of\nthe need for additional taxonomic studies involving the highly endemic\nflora of the Lake Wales Ridge, a region of extensive and continuing\nhabitat destruction due to agricultural and urban development.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicerandra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1661.phy"}]}
