Of particular interest are new environments\nfor microbial discovery. Sloths – mid-sized arboreal mammals commonly\nfound in the lowland forests of Panama – carry a wide variety of micro-\nand macro-organisms on their coarse outer fur. Here we report for the\nfirst time the isolation of diverse and bioactive strains of fungi, and\ntheir taxonomic placement, from sloth fur. Eighty-four fungi were\nisolated from the surface of sloth hair that was collected from living\nthree-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus, Bradypodidae) in SoberanÃ­a\nNational Park, Republic of Panama. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a\ndiverse group of ascomycetous fungi belonging to 28 distinct genotypes,\nseveral of which are divergent from previously known taxa. Seventy-four\nisolates were cultivated in liquid broth and crude extracts were tested\nfor bioactivity in vitro. We found a broad range of activities against\nthe parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and Chagas\ndisease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and against the human MCF-7 breast cancer\ncell line. Fifty fungal extracts were tested for antibacterial activity\nin a new antibiotic profile screen called BioMAP; of these, 20 were\nactive against at least one bacterial strain, and one had an unusual\npattern of bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria that suggests a\npossible new mode of action. Together our results reveal the importance\nof exploring novel environments for bioactive fungi, and demonstrate for\nthe first time the taxonomic composition and bioactivity of fungi from\nsloth fur.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Group 18","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 18","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68008.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 9","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 9","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68024.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 17","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 17","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68007.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 11","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 11","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68018.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 15","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 15","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68014.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 2","ntax":"191","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68016.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 10","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 10","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68017.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 5","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68011.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 7","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68012.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 12","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 12","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68019.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 13","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 13","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68020.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 6","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68021.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 4","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68023.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 20","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 20","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68010.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 19","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 19","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68009.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 16","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 16","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68028.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 3","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 8","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 8","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68013.phy"},{"tree_label":"Group 14","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Group 14","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68025.phy"}]}
