In this\nstudy, the identity of the other fungus was determined by comparing\nmorphology, pathogenicity and DNA sequence analysis of isolates of both\ntaxa. Based on these results, a new species, Botryosphaeria\neucalyptorum, and its anamorph Fusicoccum eucalyptorum, are described.\nAlthough the teleomorph is morphologically similar to other taxa in the\nB. dothidea-complex, conidial characteristics of the anamorph are\ndistinct, as well as the sequences of the nrDNA internal transcribed\nspacers ITS1 and ITS2. Like B. dothidea, the fungus is pathogenic to\nEucalyptus, although there do not appear to be clear differences in\npathogenicity between these two species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5528.phy"}]}
