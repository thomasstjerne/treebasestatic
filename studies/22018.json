P.\npedaliacearum pertains to the Erysiphe aquilegiae clade, which\nencompasses several closely allied, morphologically similar powdery\nmildew species. The close affinity to Erysiphe sedi, Pseudoidium\nhortensiae ( Oidium hortenisiae), P. neolycopersici ( Oidium\nneolycopersici) and some other taxa involved in the Erysiphe aquilegiae\ncomplex is discussed. The re-examination of P. pedaliacearum and results\nof phylogenetic analyses [5′-end of the 28S rRNA gene (including the\ndomains D1 and D2) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions] led to\na reassessment of this species and its reallocation to Erysiphe on the\nbasis of the provisions of ICN Art. 59.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudoidium pedaliacearum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117160.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudoidium pedaliacearum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117159.phy"}]}
