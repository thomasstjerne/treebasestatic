In this paper a\nclassification of better known coelacanth genera is proposed based on a\ncladistic computer analysis of 56 morphological characters. Biometrical\ndata are then matched with the classification to explore the possibility\nof identifying subtle change. It is concluded that throughout coelacanth\nhistory there have been changes in the structure of the vertebral column\ninvolving an overall increase in the number of vertebral elements, and a\nconsequent crowding of these elements within the abdominal region. These\nchanges may be associated with increasing lobation of the second dorsal\nand anal fins. In the skull, parameters involving the intracranial joint\nhave also changed in such a way that the anterior part of the skull has\nlengthened in relation to the posterior part and this may be associated\nwith an increase in length of the basicranial muscle.
