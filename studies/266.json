Understanding the evolution of this\ngroup is pertinent to their management and conservation. The purpose of\nthis study was to examine the evolutionary history of the cottontails\nusing sequence data from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. The 12S data\nprovide a robust phylogeny which was supported under a variety of\nphylogenetic approaches and transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) weighting\nschemes. Stem and loop regions of the gene were analyzed separately and\ntwo different methods of estimating Ti/Tv ratios were employed. The\nphylogeny obtained was consistent with available cytogenetic\ninformation. The 12S data indicate that separate generic status for the\npygmy rabbit, Brachylagus idahoensis, is warranted based on its\nphylogenetic position and sequence divergence values. Additionally, the\ntaxa which are geographically adjacent are also phylogenetically closely\nrelated; for example the marsh rabbit, S. palustris, and the swamp\nrabbit, S. aquaticus, are sister taxa, as are the mountain cottontail,\nS. nuttallii, and desert cottontail, S. audubonii. This finding suggests\nthat recent vicariance events might explain the diversification of\nseveral cottontail lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lagomorpha","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1332.phy"}]}
