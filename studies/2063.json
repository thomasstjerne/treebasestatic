(Diaporthales) is described from\nsenescent trunks of a palm (Licuala longicalycata) in a peat swamp.\nPhylogenetic analyses of Thailiomyces was undertaken, with partial SSU\nand LSU rDNA sequences. Our morphological and molecular results show\nthat this genus is well placed in the Diaporthales. However, it is not\nrelated to Diaporthe the genus it most closely resembles\nmorphologically. It differs from Diaporthe species in number of\ncharacters: partially immerse to superficial ascomata, ascospore\nmeasurements, bipolar appendages, not surrounded by a mucilaginous\nsheath, and with Craspedodidymum licualae Pinruan as its anamorph.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 19","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thailandiomyces bisetulosus gen. et sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 20","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thailandiomyces bisetulosus gen. et sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1061.phy"}]}
