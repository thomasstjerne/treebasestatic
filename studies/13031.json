Separate datasets for nLSU and ITS\nwere analyzed, the results showed that Megasporoporia was polyphyletic,\nforming four clades in the core polyporoid clade. Based on morphological\nand phylogenetic results, six new species: M. bannaensis, M.\nguangdongensis, M. hengduanensis, M. lacerata, M. minor and M.\npseudocavernulosa were described from China. A key to the worldwide\nspecies of Megasporoporia is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Megasporoporia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118287.phy"}]}
