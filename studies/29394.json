The three new species’ phylogenetic\nrelationships are also discussed, as well as full morphological\ndescriptions.. These species add to the increasing number of fungi known\nfrom China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135603","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135603.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig.1","ntax":"136","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135606.phy"}]}
