In\nSoutheast Asia, two processes have substantially altered the\ndistribution of land. Volcanic uplift produced many new islands during\nthe Miocene Pliocene and repeated sea level fluctuations during the\nPleistocene resulted in intermittent land connections among islands.\nEach process represents a potential driver of diversification. We use a\nphylogenetic analysis of a group of Southeast Asian shrews (Crocidura)\nto examine geographic and temporal processes of diversification. In\ngeneral, diversification has taken place in allopatry following the\ncolonization of new areas. Sulawesi provides an exception, where we\ncannot reject within-island speciation for a clade of eight sympatric\nand syntopic species. We find only weak support for temporally declining\ndiversification rates, implying that neither volcanic uplift nor sea\nlevel fluctuations had a strong effect on diversification rates. We\nsuggest that dynamic archipelagos continually offer new opportunities\nfor allopatric diversification, thereby sustaining high speciation rates\nover long periods of time, or Southeast Asian shrews represent an\nimmature radiation on a density-dependent trajectory that has yet to\nfill geographic and ecological space.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"227","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SE Asian Crocidura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6692.phy"}]}
