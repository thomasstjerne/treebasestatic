Laccaria\nfagacicola is characterized by its brownish orange basidioma and globose\nto subglobose, echinulate basidiospores with spines 12 μm long and 11.5\nμm wide at base. Laccaria pallidorosea has a small and pinkish\nbasidioma, and globose to subglobose, echinate basidiospores with spines\n1.52 μm long and 2 μm wide at base. Phylogenetic analyses based on\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region indicated that L. fagacicola is\nsister to L. rubroalba and L. aurantia, while L. pallidorosea is related\nto L. versiforma and L. salmonicolor. These two new species are\ndescribed, illustrated and compared with closely related and\nmorphologically similar species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129675","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129675.phy"}]}
