The\nanamorphs of Epichloe species have been classified in genus\nNeotyphodium, the form genus that also includes most asexual Epichloe\ndescendants. A nomenclatural realignment of this monophyletic group into\none genus would enhance a broader understanding of the relationships and\ncommon features of these grass endophytes. Based on the principle of\npriority of publication we propose to classify all members of this clade\nin the genus Epichloe. We have reexamined classification of several\ndescribed Epichloe and Neotyphodium species and varieties, and propose\nnew combinations and states. In this treatment we have accepted 43\nunique taxa in Epichloe, including distinct species, subspecies, and\nvarieties. We exclude from Epichloe the two taxa Neotyphodium starrii,\nas nomen dubium, and Neotyphodium chilense, as an unrelated taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68066.phy"}]}
