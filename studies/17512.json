This species is characterized by centrally stipitate\nbasidiocarps with umber to sienna glabrous pileus having minute cilia\nalong the margin, round to angular pores, a dimitic hyphal system with\noften inflating generative hyphae, and cylindrical to ellipsoid\nbasidiospores measuring 7â“10.5 Ã 3â“4.5 Âµm. Phylogenetic analyses\nbased on the combined LSU and ITS regions showed that P. thailandensis\nand P. tricoloma are closely related, but they differ in color of the\npore surface and size of the basidiospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyporus ML; LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87336.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Polyporus MP; LSU and ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_87335.phy"}]}
