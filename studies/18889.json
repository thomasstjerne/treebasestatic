A new\nspecies, N. vitis was isolated from the grape leaf spot in Guangxi\nProvince, China. Initially, small circular, slightly sunken, necrotic\nspots, developed on the leaf surface, mainly at the inter-vein regions.\nThe spots enlarged rapidly and become brittle with age. Phylogenetic\nspecies recognition based on analysis of the combined ITS, TUB2 and tef1\nsequence data coupled with morphology distinguished N. vitis from all\nother species in the genus. This is the first report of\nNeopestalotiopsis species causing leaf spot of grapevine in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neopestalotiopsis vitis sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96237.phy"}]}
