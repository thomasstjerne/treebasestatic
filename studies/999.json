The reduced thalli\nconsist of a basal cell layer from which haustorial cells penetrate the\ntermite and darkly-pigmented sporodochial conidionemata arise. One\nspecies, Termitaria snyderi, has been the subject of several\nmorphological studies, but its phylogenetic position has remained\nenigmatic. Here we provide evidence of a close relationship between T.\nsnyderi and the morphologically distinct ascomycetes, Kathistes\nanalemmoides and K. calyculata, based on phylogenetic analysis of\nmolecular characters derived from portions of the nuclear-encoded small\nsubunit ribosomal RNA gene (ssu rDNA) and supplemental evidence from the\n\u001a-tubulin gene. Trees were derived using parsimony and maximum likelihood\ncriteria, and Bayesian analysis and parsimony bootstrap methods were\nused to assess support for the tree nodes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termitaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4102.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Termitaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4103.phy"}]}
