Although the two fungal isolates are distinct in\nappearance and display specificity to different hosts, the isolates are\ngenetically identical in the nu- clear encoded small subunit, large\nsubunit, and internal transcribed spacer rRNA gene regions that we\nsequenced. Phylogenetic analyses and observations based on DNA placed\nthe Norwegian isolates in an Ophiostomaclade. Within the clade the\nisolates occurred in a subclade with 0. ulmi and 0. piliferum and\nseveral Ambrosiellaspecies (A. macrocarpa, A. tingens, and A. ips). A\nsecond subclade contained additional species of Ophiostomaand\nAmbrosiella.The beetle vectors of the fungi have different flight times\nand host tree usage, suggesting that their behavior helps to isolate the\nfungi in time and space.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ambrosiella SSUrDNA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50982.phy"}]}
