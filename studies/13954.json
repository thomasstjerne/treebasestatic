With such a wide host\nrange, they constitute a good model for studying the adaptation to the\nhost. Additionally, several lines of evidence link birnaviruses to\npositive strand RNA viruses and suggest that phylogenetic analyses may\nprovide clues about the positive strand to double-stranded RNA virus\ntransition. Results We characterized the genome of a birnavirus from the\nrotifer Branchionus plicalitis, a host phylogenetically very distant\nfrom the other known species targeted by birnaviruses. The rotifer\nbirnavirus genome exhibits an organization remarkably similar to other\nbirnaviruses with protein sequence identity scores ranging from 31-36%\nand 20-28%, for the capsid and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp)\nproteins, respectively. Using phylogenetic reconstruction methods, we\nanalyzed the evolutionary pathways within the Birnaviridae family. We\nalso applied a number of phylogenetic approaches based on structurally\nconserved domains/regions of the capsid and RdRp proteins to study\nevolutionary relationships between birnavirus, other double-stranded RNA\nviruses and positive strand viruses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree for segment B (VP1)","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61098.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61100.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61099.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Tree for Segment A","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61101","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61101.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61102","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61102.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61103","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61103.phy"}]}
