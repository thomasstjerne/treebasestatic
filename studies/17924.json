Most of these are forest trees, such as\nAcacia, Alnus, Eucalyptus, Populous, Quercus and others. Biscogniauxia\nspecies have been reported as endophytic fungi or secondary invaders\nthat attack only stressed plants. During a survey in Rosaceae orchards\nin southern Italy, several charcoal cankers were observed and carpophore\nsamples were collected. A collection of 31 Biscogniauxia isolates were\nanalysed. Their phylogenetic relationships were determined through study\nof ITS, Î²-tubulin and actin gene sequences. Combining morphological,\nculture and molecular data, a new species of Biscogniauxia genus is\ndescribed here as B. rosacearum. This new species is isolated for the\nfirst time from Rosaceae hosts in Apulia. The pathogenicity tests show\nthat it causes symptoms on vegetation growth of stems when artificially\ninoculated, and produces carpophores on the bark surface.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr111437","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_111437.phy"}]}
