Considerable taxonomic confusion\nexists regarding many species of Morchella. Some researchers divide this\ngenus into as high as 50 and some into 3 to 6 species. Although\nclassical taxonomy is helpful in identification for many ascomycetes,\nmorels exhibit considerable morphological diversity and there is\ndisagreement in the identification of morel species. Sequence analysis\nrevealed that in the Western Himalayan region of India, both yellow (M.\ncrassipes, M. spongiola) and black morels (M. elata, M. angusticeps and\nM. gigas) were prominent along with two Verpa species. Phylogenetic\nanalysis by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference\nrevealed two different clades and a clear distinction between yellow and\nblack morels.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP NJ","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr20967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_20967.phy"}]}
