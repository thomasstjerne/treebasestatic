Six species, i.e., M. detersa, M. dolichaula, M. mastoidea, M.\norientiexcoriata, M. procera, and M. velosa are recognized, of which M.\ndetersa and M. orientiexcoriata are new species. All of them are\ndescribed and illustrated with line drawings, and a key is provided to\nthose recognized species. The taxonomic uncertainty of M. crustosa,\noriginally described from China, is also discussed. ITS sequences were\nused to support the new species delimitations and to test the\nconspecificity between the Chinese specimens and their relatives from\nother continents. Phylogenetic analyses identify three clades within\nMacrolepiota: /macrolepiota, /macrosporae, and /volvatae clade.\n/macrolepiota clade and /macrosporae clade respectively correspond to\nsection Macrolepiota and section Macrosporae in Bons infrageneric\nclassification. Section Volvatae is proposed to accommodate species with\na volva but without clamp connections within Macrolepiota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9202.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9203.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9204.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9205.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9208.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9209.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9210.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9207.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macrolepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9206.phy"}]}
