Cladograms and strict\nconsensus trees are presented and discussed. A sequential model of the\nvicariance biogeography of the Lucilia group is presented and its\nimplications on the historical biogeography of South America is\ndiscussed. The following genera are recognized as belonging to the\ngroup: Belloa, Berroa, Chevreulia, Cualrecasasiella ( = Luciliopsis\nauct.), Facelis, Jalcophila and Lucilia. Also belonging to the Lucilia\ngroup are the two genera Gamochaetopsis and Luciliocline. A key is given\nto the nine recognized genera, each of which is described here with\nbrief descriptions and lists of recognized species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1571.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3D","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1572.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1573.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1574.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1575.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1576.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3C","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1577.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3E","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lucilia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1578.phy"}]}
