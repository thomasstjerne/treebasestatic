It is characterized by the\nproduction of multiple oospores in oogonium, which mostly has\npedicellated stalk and swollen elements below its stalk. There are not\nmany reports of the occurrence of this species in the literature.\nRecently, a report of recovering P. plurisporium isolates from Iran has\nbeen presented. Nevertheless, the re-examination of the isolates\nreferring to P. plurisporium using morphological identification as well\nas multiple gene genealogies, using both nuclear (ITS and Btub) and\nmitochondrial (cox2) loci, arises the question about the existence of\nintraspecific phenotypic variation within this species. A revision of\nmorphological characteristics among isolates assigned to P. plurisporium\nis discussed in the present paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122378","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122378.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122379","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122379.phy"}]}
