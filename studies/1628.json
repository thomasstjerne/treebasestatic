The approach combined soil DNA extraction\nthrough a bead-beating method modified to increase recovery of fungal\nDNA, PCR amplification with basidiomycete-specific primers, cloning and\nRFLP screening of mixed PCR products, and sequencing of unique clones.\nMuch greater diversity was detected than was anticipated in this habitat\non the basis of culture-based methods or surveys of fruiting bodies.\nWith ‘species’ defined as organisms yielding PCR products with > 99%\nidentity in the 5’ 650 bases of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA,\n241 species were detected among 409 unique basidiomycete sequences\nrecovered. Almost all major clades of basidiomycetes from\nbasidiomycetous yeasts and other heterobasidiomycetes through polypores\nand euagarics were represented, with a majority from the latter clade.\nOnly 24 of 241 species had 99% or greater sequence similarity to named\nreference sequences in GenBank, and several clades with multiple species\ncould not be identified at the genus level by phylogenetic comparisons\nwith named sequences. The total estimated species richness for this 11.2\nha site was 367 species of basidiomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3, raw data","ntax":"296","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycetes in Michigan Agricultural Soils","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_757.phy"}]}
