Spathulospora was represented\nby the two species S. adelpha and S. antarctica. Phylogenetic analyses\nusing Bayesian, parsimony, and neighbor-joining algorithms on SSU and\nLSU data sets agreed with the placement of Spathulospora. Both\nSpathulospora species are each others closest relatives, and group\nwithin the Lulworthiales (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota) with support in\nall analyses. Members of the morphologically similar insect parasites in\nthe Laboulbeniomycetes are not closely related to Spathulospora. Despite\nseveral striking morphological differences between Spathulospora and\nLulworthiales, an important shared morphological character was found\nthat until now had not been recognized. Ascospores of Spathulospora and\nsome members of the Lulworthiales have apical chambers containing mucus\nbelieved to be involved in ascospore attachment. A closest relative to\nSpathulospora could not be determined.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 14","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pezizomycotina, MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1779.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sordariomycetes, MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1780.phy"}]}
