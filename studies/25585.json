The fruiting bodies of\nM. petricola were dispersed on wet rock surface with numerous lichenized\nglobules. The globular thallus was organized by several green algal\nphotobiont cells with pyrenoids surrounded by mycobiont hyphae. The\nphylogenetic analyses indicated that its affiliation was in\nMulticlavula. The basidiospores of M. petricola germinated on water\nagar, and the brief descriptions of the colony morphology are also\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Multiclavula","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128199.phy"}]}
