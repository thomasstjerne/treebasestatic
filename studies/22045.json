In nature, it is a saprotrophic or facultative pathogenic\nfungus causing white-rot of hardwood in forests of warm and mild\nclimate. The ease of cultivation and fructification on solidified media\nas well as its archetypal mushroom fruit body morphology render Agrocybe\naegerita a well-suited model for investigating mushroom developmental\nbiology. Results: Here, the genome of the species is reported and\nanalysed with respect to carbohydrate active genes and genes known to\nplay a role during fruit body formation. The analysis revealed a\nconserved repertoire of fruiting-related genes and a versatile arsenal\nof biopolymer-degrading enzymes that should live up to the species\nflexible life style and archetypal mushroom morphology. Conclusions: The\ngenome resource will be useful for developing selection markers for\ntransformant selection in the process of genetic manipulation of A.\naegerita, which will then allow functional genetics approaches to\ncandidate genes potentially involved in fruiting and\nlignocellulolysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure S3","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109193.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S7","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S9","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA7","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109196.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S6","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA8_AA12","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S8","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109173.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S5","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109194.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S4","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109174.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S12","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"UPO","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109200.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S11","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"DyP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109201.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S10","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"AA9","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109198.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure S14","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"GH5","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_109199.phy"}]}
