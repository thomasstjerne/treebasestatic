Monophyly of the\nHypopterygiaceae is strongly supported, whereas Cyathophorum and\nDendrohypopterygium are unambiguously polyphyletic. Cyathophorum\nbulbosum and C. adiantum comprise a lineage sister to the remainder of\nthe family. A lineage comprising three monotypic genera\n(Canalohypopterygium, Catharomnion, and Dendrocyathophorum) and\nDendrohypopterygium arbusculum is sister to Lopidium plus a heterogenous\nclade that includes Dendrohypopterygium filiculaeforme, Hypopterygium,\nCyathophorum hookerianum, and C. parvifolium. The later two species are\ntransferred to Hypopterygium as H. hookerianum and H. parvifolium. The\nHypopterygiaceae are distinguished from their sister family, the\nHookeriaceae, by their anisophylly, and by a border of 2 or more\ndifferentiated cells on lateral leaves, although this character also\noccurs in the Hookeriaceae and has been lost at least twice in the\nHypopterygiaceae. Intermediate cells in the axillary hairs arose early\nin the evolution of the family but are lacking in the two species of\nCyathophorum that form a sister group to the remainder of the\nHypopterygiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypopterygiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4879.phy"}]}
