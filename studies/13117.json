Cruxicheiros newmanorum gen. et sp. nov. is\ndiagnosed by a single autapomorphy, the presence of a proximomedially\ninclined ridge within the groove that marks the lateral extent of the\nposterior flange of the femoral caput (trochanteric fossa). C.\nnewmanorum shows three tetanuran features: widely separated cervical\nzygapophyses, a swollen ridge on the lateral surface of the iliac blade\nand an anterior spur of the caudal neural spines. However, due to\nfragmentary preservation its affinities within Tetanurae remain\nuncertain: phylogenetic analysis places it as the most basal tetanuran,\nthe most basal megalosauroid (= spinosauroid) or the most basal\nneotetanuran.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tetanurae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55544.phy"}]}
