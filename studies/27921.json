Species of this\ngenus are known to produce bioactive compounds and can be potentially\nexploited as bioremediators of oil spill contaminated beaches; hence\ntheir biotechnological importance. In this paper, nine fungal strains\nisolated in the Mediterranean Sea, from the seagrass Posidonia oce-\nanica (L.) Delile, from driftwood and seawater contaminated by an oil\nspill, were investigated. The strains, previously identified as\nCorollospora sp., were examined by deep multi-loci phylogenetic and\nmorphological analyses. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogeny based\non seven genetic markers led to the introduction of a new species\ncomplex within the genus Corollospora: Corollospora mediterranea species\ncomplex (CMSC). The Mediterranean Sea, once again, proves an\nextraordinary reservoir of novel fungal species with a still\nundiscovered biotechnological potential.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135569.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135567.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135568.phy"}]}
