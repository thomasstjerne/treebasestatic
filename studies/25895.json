In this study,\nthe complete plastomes of two flowering epiparasites: Phacellaria\ncompressa and P. glomerata (Amphorogynaceae, Santalales) were sequenced.\nBoth species possess similar size, structure, gene content, and\narrangement of genes to other hemiparasites in Santalales. Their\nplastomes were characterized by the functional loss of plastid-encoded\nNAD(P)H-dehydrogenase and infA genes, which strongly coincides with the\ngeneral pattern of plastome degradation observed in Santalales\nhemiparasites. Our study demonstrates that the shift to epiparasitism\nand reduced vegetative bodies in P. compressa and P. glomerata do not\nappear to cause any unique plastome degradation compared with their\nclosely related hemiparasites. The epiparasitic lifestyle or an\nendophytic growth form observed in these two epiparasites may have\nlimited impact on the reductive modification of their plastomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122504.phy"}]}
