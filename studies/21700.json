Schistanthe (= sect.\nVireya), a taxon unique for its tropical habitat, distinctive leaf\nscales, and tailed seeds, have diversified greatly in morphological\nfeatures. The section contains over 300 species, occurring mainly on the\nMalay Peninsula, New Guinea, and the islands between. An analysis based\non the combined sequences of three nuclear genes supports a phylogeny in\nwhich sect. Schistanthe (less R. santapaui) is monophyletic, with\nwell-defined clades corresponding to subsections Euvireya, Malayovireya,\nPseudovireya, and Discovireya. Within subsect. Euvireya,\nmolecular-phylogenetic groupings follow geography more closely than\ntraditional taxonomic groupings based upon morphology. One of the two\nmost derived clades contains exclusively species from New Guinea,\nAustralia, and the Solomon Islands. The results are consistent with a\nstepwise phylogeographic history of sect. Schistanthe, beginning in\nAsia, proceeding eastward and reaching New Guinea within the last 15 Ma,\nwhen movement of the Australian tectonic plate brought New Guinea into\nthe Malesian domain.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhododendron sect.
