Although coevolution can drive speciation by\nspecialization of a symbiont to a host, a symbiotic relationship is not\nindicative of coevolution between host and symbiont. We tested for\ncoevolved relationships between highly specialized two- and three-toed\nsloths (Choloepus spp. and Bradypus spp., respectively) and their\nsymbiotic algae using cophylogenies and phylogeography. Our\nphylogeographic analysis showed a biogeographic pattern for the sloth\ndistribution that was not found in the algal phylogeny. We found support\nfor congruence between the sloth and algae phylogenies, implying\ncospeciation, only in the Bradypus lineage. Algae host-switching\noccurred from Bradypus spp. to Choloepus spp. Our results support a\npreviously hypothesized symbiotic relationship between sloths and the\nalgae in their fur and indicate that coevolution may have played a role\nin algae diversification. More broadly, convergent evolution may\nfacilitate host switching between deeply diverged host lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"sloth","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sloth phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102655.phy"},{"tree_label":"Algae","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Algae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102656.phy"}]}
