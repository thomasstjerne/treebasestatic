In Ceropegieae, the\nanalyzed taxa fall in four subclades. The Heterostemma subclade is\nsister to other three subclades, of which the\nConomitra-Leptadenia-Orthanthera subclade is sister to the\nAnisotoma-Neoschumannia-Riocreuxia-Sisyranthus subclade and to the large\nsubclade comprising the always stem-succulent stapeliads, Brachystelma\nand Ceropegia. Following these results, subdivision of Ceropegieae into\nfour subtribes, Ceropegiinae, Anisotominae, Heterostemminae and\nLeptadeniinae, is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceropegieae, all characters","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1240.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceropegieae, all taxa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1241.phy"}]}
