Our analyses show that the order Microstromatales comprises\nMicrostroma, Muribasidiospora triumfetticola and the anamorphic species\nRhodotorula bacarum, R. phylloplana and Sympodiomycopsis paphiopedili,\nwhereas Muribasidiospora hesperidium and Muribasidiospora indica are\nmembers of the Exobasidiales. Because of the high degree of\nmorphological divergence between Muribasidiospora triumfetticola and\nMicrostroma, a new genus, Volvocisporium, and a new family,\nVolvocisporiaceae, of the Microstromatales are proposed. Apart from the\nphylogenetic implications, the most interesting observations in the\npresent work are the unusual development of the basidia, especially of\nthe basidiospores, and the nutrient transport system from the host\nattacking hyphae to the basidia in Muribasidiospora triumfetticola.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 33","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muribasidiospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4027.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 34","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muribasidiospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4028.phy"}]}
