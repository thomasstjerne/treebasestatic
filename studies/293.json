The molecular data are consistent\nwith morphological data under the criteria of both maximum parsimony and\nmaximum likelihood, and when the data sets are combined, the support for\nmonophyly is most robust. Furthermore, use of the secondary structure of\nthe 16S molecule in aligning the DNA sequences leads to increased\nstability of results. This study presents preliminary evidence that the\nassociation between braconids and their viruses extends back in time at\nleast as far as the initial divergence of the microgastroid complex of\nsubfamilies at least 60 mya. Given this probable long association\nbetween the wasps and viruses, it is not surprising that together they\nhave evolved a rich variety of interactions with their caterpillar\nhosts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Braconidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1406.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1B","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Braconidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1407.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Braconidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Braconidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1409.phy"}]}
