The sequence of the sister species and groups is\nconsidered to be: ovata and latimana, penelope, margarita, afrodite. E.\nafrodite sp. n., widespread in the Mediterranean region, is\ndistinguished by the submedian, not subapical, metatarsal\ntrichobothrium. A redescription is given of the male palp and female\nepigyne and vulva of E. margarita.
