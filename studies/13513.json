In this\nwork, we have analyzed the culturable endophytic mycobiota associated to\nleaves and siliques of the model plant A. thaliana. We have studied the\neffect of biotic and abiotic factors in the frequency of isolation of\nfungal endophytes in plant specimens and in the species composition of\nthe endophytic community.The diversity of the endophytic assemblages of\nnatural occurring A. thaliana populations was high, and precipitation\nand temperature were the two main factors determining the diversity and\nspecies composition of the communities. This is, to our knowledge, the\nfirst systematic isolation and study of the endophytic mycobiota of A.\nthaliana. We propose A. thaliana and its endophytes as a model system\nfor an integral approach to the principles governing the endophytic\nlifestyle, taking advantage of the molecular tools and the abundant\nknowledge accessible from the host plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57937","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57937.phy"}]}
