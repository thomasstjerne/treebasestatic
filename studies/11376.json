These techniques\nonly establish pathogen presence rather than active disease. We report\nthe first use of shotgun proteomics to detect the protein expression\nprofile of buccal swabs and cloth samples from two 500-year-old Andean\nmummies. The profile of one of the mummies is consistent with immune\nsystem response to severe pulmonary bacterial infection at the time of\ndeath. Presence of a probably pathogenic Mycobacterium sp. in one buccal\nswab was confirmed by DNA amplification, sequencing, and phylogenetic\nanalyses. Our study provides positive evidence of active pathogenic\ninfection in an ancient sample for the first time. The protocol\nintroduced here is less susceptible to contamination than DNA-based or\nimmunoassay-based studies. In scarce forensic samples, shotgun\nproteomics narrows the range of pathogens to detect using DNA assays,\nreducing cost. This analytical technique can be broadly applied for\ndetecting infection in ancient samples to answer questions on the\nhistorical ecology of specific pathogens, as well as in medico-legal\ncases when active pathogenic infection is suspected.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Best tree","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Actinobacteria reference genomes HSP65","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52818.phy"}]}
