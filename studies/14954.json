Two species, Ceriporiopsis alboaurantia and C. semisupina, are\ndescribed as new to science. Ceriporiopsis alboaurantia is characterized\nby annual growth habit, resupinate basidiocarps with white pore surface\nwhen fresh, turning to apricot-orange to dark orange upon drying,\nmonomitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae encrusted with\npale yellow crystals, ellipsoid and thin-walled basidiospores (45 ´ 33.3\nµm), and plenty of pale-yellow to pale-orange oily substances in\nsubiculum and trama. Ceriporiopsis semisupina is distinguished by\nannual, effused-reflexed basidiocarps with greyish brown to reddish\nbrown pore surface, monomitic hyphal system with clamped generative\nhyphae bearing crystalline incrustation, long-clavate basidia, ellipsoid\nand thin-walled basidiospores (44.5 ´ 33.3 µm). Like previous study, the\nphylogenetic analysis presented here also showed that Ceriporiopsis is\nnot monophyletic and the sampled species were grouped in four clades,\nincluding phlebia clade, residual polyporoid clade, tyromyces clade and\ngelatoporia clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceriporiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77162.phy"}]}
