Analysis of F. oxysporum isolates\ncausing this disease indicated that the pathogen has a unique host range\nrelative to previously designated F. oxysporum formae speciales and is\nmonophyletic. Pathogenic isolates from New York and Vermont caused\nsevere vascular wilt of trefoil and moderate vascular wilt of pea but no\ndisease on alfalfa, red clover, soybean or dry bean. The host range of\ntrefoil isolates was distinct from F. oxysporum isolates pathogenic to\nother legumes. F. oxysporum isolates pathogenic to trefoil belonged to a\nsingle vegetative compatibility group separate from nonpathogenic\nisolates and shared identical mitochondrial small subunit rDNA,\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha, and nuclear rDNA intergenic\nspacer haplotypes. Phylogenetic analyses of the concatenated sequence\ndata assigned isolates pathogenic to trefoil to a single, well-supported\nclade distinct from other pathogenic F. oxysporum. We propose\ndesignating the fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtendahl emend.
