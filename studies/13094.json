A phylogenetic analysis in this study suggests that it\nis a derived ornithomimid and form a monophyly with North American\nornithomimids (Struthiomimus altus and Ornithomimus edmontonicus),\nsharing two characters (straight pubic shaft and large acute angle\nbetween pubic shaft and boot). Some characters (small anterior process\nof the pubic boot and curved pedal unguals) are seen in basal\nornithomimosaurs as well, but these features in Q. henanensis are\nreversal. Qiupalong is the first definitive ornithomimid from outside of\nthe Gobi Desert and is the southern-most occurrence of Late Cretaceous\nornithomimid from eastern Asia, demonstrating southern extension of\nornithomimid distribution in Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 9","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ornithomimosaura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55437.phy"}]}
