The evolutionary history of DHA2, ARN and GEX genes, encoding\n14-spanner MFS transporters, is reconstructed in this study. Results:\nThe translated ORFs of 31 strains from 25 hemiascomycetous species,\nincluding 10 pathogenic Candida species, were compared using a local\nsequence similarity algorithm. The constraining and traversing of a\nnetwork representing the pairwise similarity data gathered 355 full size\nproteins and retrieved ARN and GEX family members together with DHA2\ntransporters, suggesting the existence of a close phylogenetic\nrelationship among these 14-spanner major facilitators. Gene\nneighbourhood analysis was combined with tree construction methodologies\nto reconstruct their evolutionary history and 7 DHA2 gene lineages, 5\nARN gene lineages, and 1 GEX gene lineage, were identified. The S.\ncerevisiae DHA2 proteins Sge1, Azr1, Vba3 and Vba5 co-clustered in a\nlarge phylogenetic branch, the ATR1 and YMR279C genes were proposed to\nbe paralogs formed during the Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) whereas the\nclosely related ORF YOR378W resides in its own lineage. Homologs of S.\ncerevisiae DHA2 vacuolar proteins Vba1, Vba2 and Vba4 occur widespread\nin the Hemiascomycetes. Arn1/Arn2 homologs were only found in species\nbelonging to the Saccharomyces complex and are more abundant in the\npre-WGD species. Arn4 homologs were only found in sub-telomeric regions\nof species belonging to the Sacharomyces sensu strictu group (SSSG).\nArn3 type siderophore transporters are abundant in the Hemiascomycetes\nand form an ancient gene lineage extending to the filamentous fungi.\nConclusions: The evolutionary history of DHA2, ARN and GEX genes was\nreconstructed and a common evolutionary root shared by the encoded\nproteins is hypothesized. A new protein family, denominated DAG, is\nproposed to span these three phylogenetic subfamilies of 14-spanner MFS\ntransporters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Additional file 2 phylogeny","ntax":"920","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drug:H+ antiporters of family 2 (DHA2), siderophore\ntransporters (ARN) and glutathione:H+ antiporters (GEX) in\nHemiascomycete Yeasts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional file 4 phylogeny","ntax":"355","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drug:H+ antiporters of family 2 (DHA2), siderophore\ntransporters (ARN) and glutathione:H+ antiporters (GEX) in\nHemiascomycete Yeasts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69197.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional file 3 phylogeny","ntax":"355","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drug:H+ antiporters of family 2 (DHA2), siderophore\ntransporters (ARN) and glutathione:H+ antiporters (GEX) in\nHemiascomycete Yeasts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69196.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional file 9 phylogeny","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Drug:H+ antiporters of family 2 (DHA2), siderophore\ntransporters (ARN) and glutathione:H+ antiporters (GEX) in\nHemiascomycete Yeasts","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69222.phy"}]}
