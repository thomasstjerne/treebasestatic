It is\ncharacterized by a conic-umbonate, dark-greenish olivaceous pileus with\ninnate blackish fibrils; a whitish silky-fibrillose stipe, often faintly\ntinted pale yellow and with a narrowed subpointed base; subglobose to\nbroadly elliptic spores; habitat in an oak woods dominated by the\nevergreen Q. myrsinifolia; and fruiting in early winter. Phylogenetic\nanalysis targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of the\nribosomal RNA gene revealed that T. olivaceonigrum forms a\nwell-supported sister clade to T. portentosum. Other morphologically and\nphylogenetically closely related species of the section Tricholoma are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122833","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122833.phy"}]}
