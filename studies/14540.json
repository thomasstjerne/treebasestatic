As larger colonies evolve, the evolution of\nthe division of labour is hypothesised to be driven by the importance of\nindirect fitness. However, formal tests of this size-complexity\nhypothesis are rare and the influence of environmental factors on\ndivision of labour and colony size remains unclear. Here we show colony\nsize is positively related to both non-reproductive and reproductive\ndivision of labour using a phylogenetic comparative analysis of social\nand environmental traits for 33 species of Attini, a diverse tribe of\nneotropical ants. Environmental variation was not found to have a\nsignificant effect on any division of labour measure or colony size.\nUnlike previous studies, we separately analysed two components of the\ndivision of labour and reveal that colony size may be acting upon\naspects of social complexity in different ways. Non-reproductive\ndivision of labour may evolve first in response to increasing colony\nsizes, which then later impacts reproductive division of labour.\nDetermining the evolutionary drivers of colony size may help contribute\nto the mechanistic understanding of the evolution of social complexity\nin eusocial organisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"QS supertree","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77289.phy"}]}
