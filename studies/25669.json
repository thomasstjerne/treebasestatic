Both species are characterized by immersed, subglobose ascomata\nand overlapping uniseriate asci with multi-guttulate, fusiform, brown\nascospores. Amphisphaeria yunnanensis is distinguished among similar\ntaxa in having long and narrow ostiole and comparatively small fusiform\nascospores. Lepteutypa qujingensis is characterized by comparatively\nsmall ascomata and ascospores. Based on LSU-ITS phylogeny and\nmacro-micro morphology, both species are placed in Amphisphaeriaceae.\nMorphological comparisons of the accepted species in Amphisphaeria and\nLepteutypa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121537","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121537.phy"}]}
