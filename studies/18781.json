In this study, a plastome phylogenomic analysis sampled species\nfrom lineages of deeply diverging grasses including Streptochaeta\nspicata (Anomochlooideae), Leptaspis banksii and L. zeylanica (both\nPharoideae). Plastomes from next generation sequences for three species\nwere assembled by de novo methods. The unambiguously aligned coding and\nnoncoding sequences of the entire plastomes were aligned with those from\n43 other taxa, for phylogenomic and divergence estimation analyses. Rare\ngenomic changes, including persistently long ψycf1 and ψycf2 loci, the\nloss of the rpoC1 intron, and a 21 base tandem repeat insert in the\ncoding sequence for rps19 defined branch points in the grass phylogeny.\nLeptaspis and Pharus were reciprocally monophyletic, with the estimated\norigin of Leptaspis preceding that of Pharus by over 30 Ma, consistent\nwith historical biogeography. Our estimates for deep divergences among\ngrasses were older than previous such estimates, likely influenced by\nmore complete taxonomic and molecular sampling and the use of recently\navailable or previously unused fossil calibration points.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropical Forest Grasses","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99998.phy"}]}
