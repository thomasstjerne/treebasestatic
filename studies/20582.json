Three main lineages are\nstrongly supported within the Leucobryaceae, which display different\nmorphologies of the leaf costa, two dicranoid clades (Campylopus clade\nand Dicranodontium clade), and a leucobryoid clade. Character evolution\nanalyses resolved the leucobryoid morphology as a synapomorphy for the\nleucobryoid clade, and provided data to evaluate generic\ncircumscriptions within the family. Patterns of molecular variation,\nspecies richness, geographical distribution, ecological amplitude and\nvariation in costa structure seem to co-vary: the two lineages with the\nmost modified morphologies (deviating from the basic dicranoid type;\nCampylopus and leucobryoid clades) are also the most molecularly\nvariable, species diverse, and occupy the broadest distributions and\nwidest variety of habitats. Most sampled genera have clear\nmorpho-molecular circumscriptions, except Campylopodiella,\nDicranodontium and Leucobryum. For the latter two alternative topologies\nwere resolved (Leucobryum monophyletic or the Asian genera\nCladopodanthus and Schistomitrium nested within Leucobryum).","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI leucobryoid clade con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102226","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102226.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105669.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105670.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI Dicranodontium con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102224","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102224.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML Dicranodontium","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102225","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102225.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree ML leucobryoid clade","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102227","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_102227.phy"}]}
