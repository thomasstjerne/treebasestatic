Here we combine\nancestral sequence reconstruction with functional characterization and\nstructural modeling to directly examine the evolution of\nsequence-structure-function across the early differentiation of animal\nand plant Dicer/DCL proteins, which perform the first molecular step in\nRNA interference by identifying target RNAs and processing them into\nshort interfering products. We found that ancestral Dicer/DCL proteins\nevolved similar increases in RNA target affinities as they diverged\nindependently in animal and plant lineages. In both cases, increases in\nRNA target affinities were associated with sequence changes that\nanchored the RNAs 5phosphate, but the structural bases for 5phosphate\nrecognition were different in animal vs plant lineages. These results\nhighlight how molecular-functional evolutionary convergence can derive\nfrom the evolution of unique protein structures implementing similar\nbiochemical mechanisms.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107984.phy"},{"tree_label":"mafft","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107980","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107980.phy"},{"tree_label":"clustalw","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107982","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107982.phy"},{"tree_label":"muscle coredomains","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108037","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108037.phy"},{"tree_label":"muscle","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107981","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107981.phy"},{"tree_label":"clustalw coredomains","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicer clustalw_coredomains","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108069.phy"},{"tree_label":"mafft coredomains","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108038","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108038.phy"},{"tree_label":"supertree","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107983","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107983.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108074","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108074.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108073","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108073.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108075.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108076","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108076.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108077","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108077.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1229","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicer clustalw_coredomains-gb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108078.phy"},{"tree_label":"elision","ntax":"1255","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dicer elision","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107890.phy"}]}
