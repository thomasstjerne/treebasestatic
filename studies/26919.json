Five\nnew species, namely T. australe, T. guangxiensis, T. latispora, T.\nparallela and T. subfibulifera, are described based on morphological\ncharacteristics, molecular evidence, ecology, and geographic\ndistribution. Eleven ITS, eight nLSU, five mt-SSU, six RPB1, four RPBB2\nand seven TEF1 sequences were newly generated and phylogenetic analyses\nwere performed by the ITS dataset and the combined ITS, nLSU, mt-SSU,\nRPB1, RPB2 and TEF1 dataset. The six species form six independent\nlineages with robust support in both datasets. Illustrated description\nof the six species and discussions with related species are provided.\nThe size of basidiospores is stable and important characteristics for\ndistinguishing the species within the complex, and ITS sequence is a\nsensitive marker to discriminate species. A comparison of the\ncharacteristics of the species in the complex is provided herein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tremellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129110.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tremellales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129111.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tremella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132037.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tremella","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132038.phy"}]}
