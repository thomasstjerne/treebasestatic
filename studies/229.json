Analysis of 31 characters produced\nten topologically similar and equally parsimonious cladograms. A strict\nconsensus tree derived from these cladograms places Lyginopteris as the\nsister taxon to the other seed plants included. Within this clade all\nthe taxa considered, except medullosans and cycads, form a single\nmonophyletic group defined by the presence of flattened seeds and\nsaccate pollen (platysperms). Relationships between medullosans, cycads,\nand platysperms were not resolved, but within the platysperm clade\nconifers and cordaites (Cordaixylon, Mesoxylon) + Ginkgo form a\nmonophyletic group (coniferophytes). The higher platysperms\n(glossopterids, Caytonia, corystosperms, Bennettitales, Pentoxylon,\nGnetales, and angiosperms) are also monophyletic, but their relationship\nto coniferophytes, peltasperms, and Callistophyton is unresolved.\nPentoxylon is placed as sister taxon to the Bennettitales, and together\nthey form the sister group to a clade in which Gnetales and angiosperm\nare sister taxa. The Bennettitales + Pentoxylon + Gnetales + angiosperms\n(anthophytes) form a monophyletic sister group to the corystosperms.\nThis analysis is compared with current classifications of seed plants.\nIt does not support a close relationship between Bennettitales and\ncycads, it provides no evidence for seed plant polyphyly, and it\nstrongly suggests that the current concept of seed ferns has little\nvalue in a phylogenetic context.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"seed plants","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4332.phy"}]}
