It is widely distributed at\nthe plant-deprived edges of extremely alkaline lakes and locally\nabundant. We sequenced the genome of S. alkalinus and reconstructed\nevolution of catabolic enzymes, using a phylogenomic comparison. We\nfound that the genome of S. alkalinus is larger, but its predicted\nproteome is smaller and heavily depleted of both plant-degrading enzymes\nand proteinases, when compared to its closest plant-pathogenic\nrelatives. Interestingly, despite overall losses, S. alkalinus has\nretained many proteinases families and acquired\nbacterial-cell-wall-degrading enzymes, some of them via horizontal gene\ntransfer from bacteria. This fungus has very potent proteolytic activity\nat high pH values, but slowly-induced low activity of cellulases and\nhemicellulases. Our experimental and in silico data suggest that plant\nbiomass, a common food source for most fungi, is not a preferred\nsubstrate for S. alkalinus in its natural environment. We conclude the\nfungus has abandoned the ancestral plant-based diet, and has become\nspecialized in a more protein-rich food, abundantly available in soda\nlakes in the form of prokaryotes and small crustaceans.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sodiomyces alkalinus 100 rapid bootstraps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109660.phy"}]}
