All Cladosporium species occurring in indoor\nenvironments are fully described and illustrated. Fourty-six\nCladosporium species are treated of which 16 species are introduced as\nnew. A key for the most common Cladosporium species isolated from indoor\nenvironments is provided. Cladosporium halotolerans proved to be the\nmost frequently isolated Cladosporium species indoors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"412","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"First of 1000 equally most parsimonious trees from the\ncladosporioides complex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"412","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished Bayesian phylogeny derived from the\ncladosporioides complex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"412","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished RAxML phylogeny derived from the\ncladosporioides complex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115667.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished RAxML phylogeny derived from the herbarum\ncomplex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115670.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2 Bayesian phylogeny derived from the herbarum\ncomplex actin and elongation factor alignment","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115668.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"220","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished first of 1000 equally most parsimonious\ntrees from the herbarum complex actin and elongation factor\nalignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115669.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"First of 1000 equally most parsimonious trees from the\nCladosporium ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115674.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished Bayesian phylogeny derived from the\nCladosporium ITS alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115675.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bayesian phylogeny derived from the sphaerospermum\ncomplex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115671.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished RAxML phylogeny derived from the\nsphaerospermum complex actin and elongation factor alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115672.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"309","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unpublished first of 1000 equally most parsimonious\ntrees from the sphaerospermum complex actin and elongation factor\nalignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_115673.phy"}]}
