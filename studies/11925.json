Empirical evaluation of species trees is necessary to\nassess the performance (i.e., accuracy and precision) of these methods\nwith real data, which consists of gene genealogies likely shaped by\ndifferent historical and demographic processes. We analyzed 20 loci for\n16 species of the South American lizards of the Liolaemus darwinii\nspecies group and reconstructed a species tree with *BEAST, then\ncompared the performance of this method under different sampling\nstrategies of loci, individuals, and sequence lengths. We found an\nincrease in the accuracy and precision of species trees with the number\nof loci, but for any number of loci, accuracy substantially decreased\nonly when using only one individual per species or 25% of the full\nsequence length (∼ 147 bp). In addition, locus “informativeness” was an\nimportant factor in the accuracy/precision of species trees when using a\nfew loci, but it became increasingly irrelevant with additional loci.\nOur empirical results combined with the previous simulation studies\nsuggest that there is an optimal range of sampling effort of loci,\nindividuals, and sequence lengths for a given speciation history and\ninformation content of the data. Future studies should be directed\ntoward further assessment of other factors that can impact performance\nof species trees, including gene flow, locus “informativeness,” tree\nshape, missing data, and errors in species delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 4loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48675.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 16loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48672.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 8loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48674.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST CYTB","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48679.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Phased 20loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48676.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 12loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48673.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 20loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48671.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEST Unphased 20loci","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48677.phy"},{"tree_label":"BEAST Unphased 19loci without cytb","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees of the Liolaemus darwinii group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48678.phy"}]}
