Lobaria (Lobariaceae) in Macaronesia","Journal":" The Bryologist","Volume":" 113","Issue":" 3","Pages":"","Keywords":" EF-1a, isidia, ITS, lichen systematics, RPB2, soredia","DOI":" 10.1639/0007-2745-133.x.page#","Abstract":" The species in Lobaria sect. Lobaria are circumscribed\nbased on secondary metabolites and the morphology of vegetative\npropagules such as isidia and soredia. Lobaria pulmonaria typically\nforms soredia, which distinguish it from the other species of this\nsection. However, in L. pulmonaria soredia may develop into isidioid\nsoredia that can be confused with isidia. In Macaronesia, this\ndifficulty gave rise to controversial discussion about the taxonomic\nstatus of L. pulmonaria var. meridionalis, which forms cylindrical\ndiaspores. In the present study, a three loci approach (ITS, RPB2 and\nEF-1a) was used to investigate the taxonomic status of L. pulmonaria\nvar. meridionalis based on a phylogeny of Macaronesian taxa of the L.\npulmonaria group. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that L. pulmonaria v.\nmeridionalis is a distinct taxon, which is here proposed at the rank of\nspecies: Lobaria macaronesica Cornejo & Scheidegger sp. nov. The new\nspecies is genetically distinct from the Asian L. meridionalis, the\ncosmopolitan L.pulmonaria and the Macaronesian L. immixta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Lobaria sect","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9910.phy"}]}
