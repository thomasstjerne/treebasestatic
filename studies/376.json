We sampled at least one accession of all eight species of\nAdansonia plus three outgroup taxa from tribe Adansonieae. These data\nwere analyzed singly and in combination using parsimony. ITS and\nmorphology provided the greatest resolution and were highly concordant.\nThe two chloroplast data sets showed concordance with one another but\ndisagreed with ITS and morphology. This disagreement was found to be\nsignificant using a Wilcoxon sign-rank test and an incongruence length\ndifference test. The most likely explanation of the conflict is\ngenealogical discordance within the Malagasy Longitubae, perhaps due to\nintrogression events. A maximum-likelihood analysis of branching times\nshows that the dispersal between Africa and Australia occurred well\nafter the fragmentation of Gondwana and, therefore, involved over-water\ndispersal. The phylogeny does not permit unambiguous reconstruction of\nfloral evolution, but suggests the plausible hypothesis that hawkmoth\npollination was ancestral in Adansonia and that there were two parallel\nswitches to mammal-pollination in the genus.
