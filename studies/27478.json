{"Authors":" Zhan Bo Liu","Year":" 2021","Title":" Global diversity and taxonomy of Sidera (Hymenochaetales,\nBasidiomycota): seven new species and keys to species of the genus","Journal":" Journal of Fungi","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Phylogenetic analysis; Rickenellaceae; wood-rotting\nfungi","DOI":"","Abstract":" The genus Sidera is a polypore genus with resupinate,\nwhite to cream or buff fresh basidioma, poroid or hydnoid hymenophore, a\nmonomitic or dimitic hyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamp\nconnections, the presence of rosette-like crys-tals, and allantoid to\nlunate basidiospores. We study the phylogeny and diversity of Sidera\nherein by using both morphological and molecular methods. Phylogenetic\nanal-yses are based on a concatenated ITS+nLSU+RPB1+RPB2+TEF1+mtSSU+nSSU\nse-quence data of 20 taxa of Sidera all over the world. Among these\nseven species are new to science, viz.Â Sidera americana, S. inflata, S.\nmalaysiana, S. monomitica, S. pseudolenis, S. punctata and S.\nqinlingensis. In addition, three taxa are treated as Sidera sp. New\nspecies are all described and illustrated. An identification key to 17\naccepted species of Sidera in worldwide is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132028","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132028.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132029","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132029.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132030","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132030.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132031","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132031.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132032","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132032.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132033","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132033.phy"}]}
