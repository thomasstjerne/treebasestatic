{"Authors":" Justin Thomas Wynns, Conny B. Asmussen-Lange","Year":" 2014","Title":" A comparison of 16 DNA regions for use as phylogenetic\nmarkers in the pleurocarpous moss genus Plagiothecium (Hypnales).","Journal":" American Journal of Botany","Volume":" 101","Issue":" 4","Pages":" 1-18","Keywords":" barcoding; bryophytes; intergenic spacer; intron; ITS;\nmolecular systematics; rbcL; trnK/matK","DOI":" 10.3732/ajb.1300269","Abstract":"  Premise of the study: Within the Hypnales  the most\nderived and species-rich order of pleurocarpous mosses  phylogenies at\nor below the family level often show poor resolution. In preparation for\na phylogeny of the genus Plagiothecium, we wished to identify the DNA\nmarkers best suited for evolutionary reconstruction in this group of\nhypnalean pleurocarps.  Methods: For each of 25 collections of\nPlagiothecium and associated taxa, 16 DNA regions were sequenced:\nnuclear ITS and 26S, and plastid rps4, rps4trnL, trnLF, trnK(matK)psbA,\npsbAtrnH, trnMV, trnDT, rbcL, atpBrbcL, psbTH, rpoC1 exon 2 (partial),\nthe trnG intron, the rpl16 intron and the plastid ribosomal spacer DNA\n(cpITS). Each region was evaluated on the basis of its ability to\nresolve clades, the amount of homoplasy present in the data set, and the\nrelative ease of obtaining the data. Descriptive statistics for each\nregion are given.  Key results: Under-utilized plastid markers for\nbryophytes like trnKpsbA, rps4trnL and trnDT outperformed more\ntraditional markers like trnLF and rps4. Individual plastid topologies\nwere similar, suggesting that only a limited amount of plastid data are\nneeded to recover a backbone phylogeny. Adding a small amount of nuclear\nribosomal data to a large plastid matrix restructured the recovered\ntopology, emphasizing the importance of sampling multiple genomes and\nthe need for new low-copy nuclear markers in bryophyte systematics. \nConclusions: Future genus-level phylogenies of pleurocarpous mosses\nshould target under-utilized plastid markers like trnKpsbA and rps4trnL\nin conjunction with low-copy nuclear markers.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
