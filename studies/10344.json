Based on colony morphology and conidial\ncharacteristics, 367 strains of Botrytis spp. were identified as five\ndistinct species, namely B. cinerea, B. squamosa, B. porri, B. byssoidea\nand an undescribed species of Botrytis (Botrytis sp.), which accounted\nfor 64.3, 29.9, 3.3, 0.3, and 2.2%, respectively. Botrytis sp. is herein\ndescribed as a new species, Botrytis sinoallii sp. nov., which is\ncharacterized by production of numerous small sclerotia on potato\ndextrose agar. Phylogenetic analysis using partial sequences of three\nnuclear genes (G3PDH, HSP60 and RPB2) showed that B. sinoallii forms a\nunique lineage, which is closely related to the lineage of B. squamosa,\na well-known species on Allium crops, but distantly related to lineages\nof the other species of Botrytis on Allium crops, including B. cinerea,\nB. porri, B. aclada, B. allii, B. byssoidea, B. globosa and B.\nsphaerosperma. Results of inoculation tests showed that B. sinoallii is\na novel agent causing leaf blight of green onion, garlic and garlic\nchives. Potential impact of B. sinoallii on production of Allium crops\nin China is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"c.Â Fig. 3","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Molecular phylogeny of 68 taxa of Botrytis spp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47824.phy"}]}
