Comprehensive fieldwork and the\nacquisition of numerous sequences for previously neglected African\nCantharellus species formed the basis for a reappraisal of generic and\nspecies delimitation. The genus is characterized morphologically by the\nbasidiomata having thick, distantly spaced diverging gills of variegated\ncolour. In contrast to most of Cantharellus, Afrocantharellus mostly\nlacks clamp connections. Phylogenies of Cantharellus and\nAfrocantharellus based on LSU and a concatenated data set are provided,\nalong with descriptions of and a key to the species of Afrocantharellus.\nNew combinations in Afrocantharellus are proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Afroantharellus, Bayesian analysis of the large LSU\ndataset","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Afroantharellus, concatenated LSU/5.8-ITS2/ATP6","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_52823.phy"}]}
