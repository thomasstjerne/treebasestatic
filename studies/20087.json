Here,\nleveraging a rich red algal genome and transcriptome dataset, we used\n298 single-copy orthologous nuclear genes from 15 red algal species to\nerect a robust multi-gene phylogeny of Rhodophyta. This tree places red\nseaweeds (Bangiophyceae and Florideophyceae) at the base of the\nmesophilic red algae with the remaining non-seaweed mesophilic lineages\nforming a well-supported sister group. The early divergence of seaweeds\ncontrasts with the evolution of multicellular land plants and brown\nalgae that are nested among multiple, unicellular or filamentous sister\nlineages. Using this novel perspective on red algal evolution, we\nstudied the evolution of the pathways for isoprenoid biosynthesis. This\nanalysis revealed losses of the mevalonate pathway on at least three\nseparate occasions in lineages that contain Cyanidioschyzon,\nPorphyridium, and Chondrus. Our results establish a framework for\nin-depth studies of the origin and evolution of metabolic pathways in\nRhodophyta.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Red algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_99468.phy"}]}
