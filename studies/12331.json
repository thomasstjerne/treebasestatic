(Asteraceae) reveal\npatterns of adaptive radiation, multiple colonization and interspecific\nhybridization","Journal":" Cladistics","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" adaptive radiation; hybridization; island colonization;\nlow copy nuclear marker; Macaronesia; novel species","DOI":" 10.1111/cla.12005","Abstract":" The plant genus Tolpis (Asteraceae) has been the subject\nof several investigations on the evolution of oceanic island plants. Its\ninsular species were utilized in studies of artificial hybrid fertility,\ntesting the validity of Baker\u0002s law, the application of DNA barcodes, and\nthe phylogenetic utility of inter-simple sequence repeat markers.\nDespite this considerable interest in Tolpis, little is known about its\nphylogenetic history. Past investigations were unable to resolve most of\nthe interspecific relationships, especially within the Canary Islands,\nwhere the genus is particularly diverse. Incomplete taxon sampling, the\nuse of ambiguous outgroups and the limited utility of slowly evolving\nchloroplast DNA markers precluded detailed reconstructions. The present\ninvestigation presents a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Tolpis. By\nutilizing highly variable nuclear DNA markers and a comprehensive taxon\nset, we have resolved the majority of interspecific relationships in the\ngenus. Evaluations of competing tree topologies and ancestral area\nreconstructions complemented the analyses. Our results highlight the\npresence of three dominant mechanisms of island plant evolutionisland\ncolonization, adaptive radiation and interspecific hybridizationin\nTolpis: (i) the extant distribution of the genus is the result of two\nindependent colonization pathways, (ii) Tolpis has colonized at least\none archipelago multiple times, (iii) the present insular diversity is\nthe product of adaptive radiation, (iv) potential hybridization was\ndetected between species now inhabiting different islands and\narchipelagoes, indicating sympatric historical distributions, and (v)\nseveral undescribed species await taxonomic recognition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"B12 Bayesian consensus tree with indels: Table 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"B12 Majority rule
