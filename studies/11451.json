Determination of the evolutionary\nprocesses behind this phenomenon has long been hampered by the\nunreliability of phylogenetic reconstructions within this group of\nbacteria. The main reasons have been the absence of sufficient data, the\nhighly derived nature of the symbiont genomes and lack of appropriate\nphylogenetic methods. Due to the extremely aberrant nature of their DNA,\nthe symbiotic lineages within Enterobacteriaceae form long branches and\ntend to cluster as a monophyletic group. This state of phylogenetic\nuncertainty is now improving with an increasing number of complete\nbacterial genomes and development of new methods. In this study, we\naddress the monophyly versus polyphyly of enterobacterial symbionts by\nexploring a multigene matrix within a complex phylogenetic\nframework.","trees":[{"tree_label":"AA GTR MB","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterobacteriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43826.phy"},{"tree_label":"AA LG ML","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterobacteriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43827.phy"},{"tree_label":"AA WAG BI","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterobacteriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43828.phy"},{"tree_label":"NA GTR ML","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterobacteriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43830.phy"},{"tree_label":"NA GTR BI","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enterobacteriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_43829.phy"}]}
