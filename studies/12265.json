Fungal\nisolates were obtained from Festuca myuros L. grown in Nanjing. The\nendophyte infection level was estimated as high as 91.4% in 148 plant\nsamples from different sites, indicating endophyte infection is popular\nin F. myuros grown in Nanjing. Morphological characteristics of all 11\nisolates were identical with each other, and similar with those of\nNeotyphodium spp.. Phylogenetic analysis based on tefA and tubB loci\nindicated that this fungal isolates clustered with Neotyphodium\nsinofestucae, a previous reported species harbored in Festuca parvigluma\nSteud.. These fungal endophyte from F. myuros in China was then\nidentified as Neotyphodium sinofestucae. Tiny difference in\nmorphological features and close evolutionary relationship in tefA and\ntubB information were demonstrated between isolates from these 2\ndifferent host species. This exhibit a different evolutionary pathways\nin Neotyphodium spp. and fungal diversity of grass endophytes in Festuca\nspp..","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium endophyte tefA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50548.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neotyphodium endophyte tubB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50541.phy"}]}
