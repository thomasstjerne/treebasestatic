This\nphylogeny features signature sequences of 114 ex-types and numerous\nauthentic isolates that were designated as representative isolates by\nthe originators of the respective species. Multiple new subclades were\nassigned in clades 2, 6, 7, and 9. A single species P. lilii was placed\nbasal to clades 1 to 5, and 7. Phytophthora stricta was placed basal to\nother clade 8 species, P. asparagi to clade 6 and P. intercalaris to\nclade 10. On the basis of this phylogeny and ancestral state\nreconstructions, new hypotheses were proposed for the evolutionary\nhistory of sporangial papillation of Phytophthora species. Non-papillate\nancestral Phytophthora species were inferred to evolve through separate\nevolutionary paths to either papillate or semi-papillate species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BA tree","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96067.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96068.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"376","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_96069.phy"}]}
