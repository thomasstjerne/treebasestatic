Using a modified Sanger sequencing protocol, we obtained\nDNA sequences of duckweed nuclear ribosomal regions, including 18S and\n26S rDNA genes, the external transcribed spacer (ETS), and the\nfrequently utilized internal transcribed spacer (ITS). After obtaining\nsequence data for all Lemnaceae species, we ascertained that prior\ndifficulty in sequencing the ITS regions likely resulted from extremely\nrigid secondary structures, precipitated by a high proportion of G/C\nnucleotides. In phylogenetic analyses, nuclear ribosomal data largely\nsupported relationships that had been inferred using chloroplast DNA\nsequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lemnaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_69210.phy"}]}
