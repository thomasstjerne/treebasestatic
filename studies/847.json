The 25S rDNA was partly\nsequenced from several isolates of B. ornatipes, B. retipes, and allied\nspecies in the Boletaceae to aid identification. The phylogenetic\nanalysis using maximum likelihood suggests that both species are\ndifferently distributed. In addition, our results are supported by a\nprevious study of Hellwig, separating three groups in the B.\nretipes/ornatipes-complex based on chemotaxonomical characters.\nRetipolides form the major pigments in presently analyzed B. ornatipes\nand B. retipes collections and are also detected in B. flavoniger. This\ngroup of secondary metabolites is unique in the Boletales and is\ncharacteristic of the new genus Retiboletus, in which B. ornatipes\n(type), B. retipes, and B. flavoniger are placed. A positive proof of\nretipolides is still missing in B. griseus and Tylopilus nigerrimus.\nBoth species are transferred to Retiboletus according to morphological\ncharacters and sequence data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Maxlikelihood","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Retiboletus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5674.phy"}]}
