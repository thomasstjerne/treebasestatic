Four\nvarieties can be recognized, and are formally recognized here as Tenaxia\ndisticha var. disticha, var. vlokii H.P.Linder, var. dracomontana\nH.P.Linder and var. lustricola H.P.Linder. Tenaxia disticha var.\ndisticha is widespread in eastern southern Africa, from Cape Agulhas at\nthe southern tip of Africa to Inyangani in Zimbabwe; the other three\nvarieties are highly localized: var. vlokii in the southern Cape and\nvars. dracomontana and lustricola on the high plateau of the\nDrakensberg. Chloroplast DNA nucleotide variation revealed only limited\ngeographical pattern, but all regions and all varieties have numerous\nhaplotypes, with no haplotype-poor areas. This is consistent with a\nmodel where this grass species has occupied its current distribution\nrange a long time, possibly since the Late Miocene, thus allowing the\nbuildup of local haplotype diversity. The divergence of the Drakensberg\nvarieties may have been stimulated by the Pliocene uplift of these\nmountains resulting in a sub-alpine climate. Such a phylogeographical\nmodel is consistent with the hypothesis that southern Africa was not\nsubjected to the dramatic Pleistocene climatic fluctuations driving\nextensive range changes, typical of the temperate Northern Hemisphere\nphylogeographical patterns.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE 0","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64259","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64259.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 1000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64260","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64260.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 2000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64261","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64261.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 3000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64262","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64262.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 4000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64263","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64263.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 5000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64264","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64264.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 7000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64266","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64266.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 8000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64267","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64267.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 9000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64268","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64268.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 10000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64269","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64269.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 11000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64270","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64270.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 12000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64271","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64271.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 13000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64272","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64272.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 14000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64273","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64273.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 15000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64274","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64274.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 16000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64275","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64275.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 17000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64276","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64276.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 18000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64277","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64277.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 19000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64278","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64278.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 20000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64279","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64279.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 21000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64280","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64280.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 24000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64283","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64283.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 25000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64284","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64284.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 26000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64285","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64285.phy"},{"tree_label":"STATE 27000","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64286","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64286.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64289","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64289.phy"}]}
