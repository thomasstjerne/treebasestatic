The genus is typified by\nL. albomarginata sp. nov. which is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, resupinate basidiocarps with yellow pores, a monomitic hyphal\nsystem with clamp connections, tramal hyphae with swollen tips which\nprojecting out of hymenium, and hyaline, thin-walled, oblong-ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. Phylogeny of L. albomarginata and its related species was\ninferred from ITS and nLSU rDNA sequences, and the genus belongs to the\nMeruliaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
