This species is unique among\ncongeners by having a pulverulent, bright orange-yellow volva remnant on\nits pileus, a slender stipe covered by orange-yellow floccose scales, a\nglobose to subglobose, amyloid basidiospore and the lacking of clamps in\nall parts of basidioma. Particular morphological characteristics, along\nwith the phylogenetic analysis based on a combined dataset of partial\nnuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacers region (ITS) and partial\nnuclear rDNA large subunit region (nrLSU) confirmed our specimens are A.\naureofloccosa. A brief geographical distributions, a detailed\ndescription, line-drawing illustrations and a brief comparison with\nmorphological similar taxa are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136068","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136068.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136069","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136069.phy"}]}
