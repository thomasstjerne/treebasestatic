The present investigation aimed\nto confirm the identity of the CBS pathogen as P. citricarpa and\ndetermine its mating-type distribution in Cuba. Phyllosticta isolates\nwere collected from major Cuban citrus-producing provinces (Matanzas,\nCienfuegos, Camagüey and Santiago de Cuba). P. citricarpa and the\nendophyte P. capitalensis (Henn.) were identified by polyphasic\ntaxonomy, integrating morpho-physiological characteristics with the\nphylogenetic analysis of ITS, actA , LSU and tef1 loci. Mating-type (\nMAT) analysis revealed that only the MAT1-2 idiomorph of P. citricarpa\nis present in Cuba, providing evidence of an atypical CBS disease cycle.\nThese results contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology\nof CBS in Cuba and the improvement of CBS management.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1.
