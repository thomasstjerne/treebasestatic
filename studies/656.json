This fungus forms a membranous ascoma with a long neck\nthat is ornamented with lateral glandular hairs and terminal aglandular\nhairs; filamentous, septate paraphyses and deliquescent asci with\nhyaline, unicellular ascospores are formed in the base of the centrum.\nIn order to analyze the systematic position of this ascomycete its\nmorphological characters and 18S rDNA sequences were studied and\ncompared with superficially similar species. Based on morphological and\nphylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA sequences, this fungus belongs in the\nSordariales and is close to but separate from Chaetomium. The hyaline\nascospores, without a germ pore, and the possession of an ascoma with a\nlong neck ornamented with lateral glandular hairs is in contrast to\nother genera of the Chaetomiaceae. For these reasons, the new genus\nGuanomyces is proposed to accommodate the new species G. polythrix in\nthe Chaetomiaceae, of the Sordariales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Guanomyces phylogenetic relationships","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3633.phy"}]}
