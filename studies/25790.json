(Musci: Hypnaceae): insights into its inter-generic\nrelationships and evidence for paraphyly","Journal":" NA","Volume":" NA","Issue":" NA","Pages":" 198 - 233","Keywords":" Ectropothecium, Hypnaceae, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, phylogeny,\npleurocarpous mosse, rpL32-trnL, systematics, trnH-psbA, trnSGG","DOI":"","Abstract":" Membership of the Hypnales has long been in a state of\nflux and the phylogeny of one of its largest genera, Ectropothecium, is\nvirtually unknown. To infer evolutionary relationships, we assembled two\ndatasets covering 75 and 59 species of moss for three cpDNA regions\n(rpL32-trnL, trnH-psbA, trnSGG) and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nDNA regions in\ncombination. Both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of\nthe first dataset showed that Ectropothecium as currently circumscribed\nwith the inclusion of Hypnum plumaeforme and Trachythecium verrucosum\nwithin a strongly supported ‘Ectropothecium’ clade. Sister to that clade\nwas two species of Vesicularia. Analyses of the second dataset recovered\nseveral strongly supported clades within the Ectropothecium clade. The\ntype of the genus, E. tutuilum, however, fell within one of the\ninclusive clades which call to include better sampling of Ectropothecium\nspecies as well as the need to sample more informative molecular\nmarkers. Overall, results of the analyses revealed a clear framework for\nunderstanding the relationships of Ectropothecium and thus provided an\napproach for conducting combined molecular and morphological analysis of\nthis group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
