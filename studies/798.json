Sequence data of\n18S ribosomal DNA genes from non-fast evolving species of acoels and\nother metazoans reveal that this group does not belong to the\nPlatyhelminthes but represents the extant members of the earliest\ndivergent Bilateria, an interpretation that is supported by recent\nstudies on the embryonic cleavage pattern and nervous system of acoels.\nThis study has implications for understanding the evolution of major\nbody plansl, and for perceptions of the Cambrian evolutionary\nexplosion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3956.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 2","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3957.phy"},{"tree_label":"sFig. 4","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metazoans","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3958.phy"}]}
