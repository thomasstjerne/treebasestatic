In addition to containing an order of\nmagnitude more silica in their cell walls, freshwater diatoms also\nappear to have a less efficient silicic acid uptake mechanism. A novel\nset of silicon transporters (SITs), encoded by a small gene family,\nimport silicic acid from the environment into the diatom cell. Some\nevidence suggests that the disparity in uptake efficiency between marine\nand freshwater diatoms might be attributable to different demands on\nSITs in the two environments. To test this hypothesis, partial SIT genes\nwere cloned and sequenced from 45 species of Thalassiosirales, a diatom\nlineage with high diversity in marine and freshwaters. Phylogenetically\nbased codon substitution models were used to test whether SITs from\nmarine and freshwater taxa were under similar selective constraints and\nwhether codons in different structural locations of the protein were\nunder similar functional constraints. Purifying selection is the\npredominant evolutionary force acting on SITs, irrespective of location\nin the protein, and differences in efficiency of silicic acid uptake\nbetween marine and freshwater diatoms are not due to sequence\ndifferences in SITs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine and Freshwater Diatoms","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5174.phy"}]}
