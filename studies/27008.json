It produces poroconidia which are hyaline, cylindrical\nand aseptate, from pores in the basal cell of dark, erect, stiff setae.\nThe genus is compared morphologically with similar hyphomycete genera\nhaving setae and/or phialidic conidiogenous cells, such as\nCircinotrichum, Cylindrotrichum and Kylindria. Phylogenetic relationship\nof Wenhsuiporus was sought by comparing the sequences of its ITS, LSU\nand RPB2 gene segments with those from representative taxa in the\nAustraliascaceae, Chaetosphaeriaceae, Glomerellaceae, Reticulascaceae,\nPlectosphaerellaceae and Xylariales. Phylogenetic tree inferred from\nconcatenated sequences of these multilocus gene segments revealed the\nplacement of this new genus within the Sordariomycetes and closely\nrelated to the Reticulascaceae of the Glomerellales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Wenhsuiporus TRE","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126371","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126371.phy"}]}
