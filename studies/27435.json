During an\ninvestigation of xylarialean fungi, we collected Eutypella-like taxon\nwhich is distinct from Eutypella s. str. in our phylogenetic analyses\n(ITS and β-tubulin) thus, introduced as Paraeutypella guizhouensis gen.\net sp. nov.. Paraeutypella is characterized by having 425 perithecia in\na stroma each with 36 sulcate, long ostiolar necks. Paraeutypella\ncitricola comb. nov. (basionym: Eutypella citricola) is introduced on\nAcer sp. from China. Diatrypella longiasca sp. nov. is introduced as a\nnew species in Diatrypella s. str. which has 25 ascomata per stromata\nand long ascospores, unusual when compared to other Diatrypella species\nand distinct phylogenetically.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127984.phy"}]}
