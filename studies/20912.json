Uncinula (Lév.) U. Braun & Shishkoff was recorded on\ntwo species of ash, Fraxinus excelsior L. and F. pennsylvanica Marshall\n(Oleaceae), from Ukraine (Kyiv). Based on the comparative morphological\nanalysis of Ukrainian specimens with samples of Erysiphe fraxinicola U.\nBraun & S. Takam. and E. salmonii (Syd.) U. Braun & S. Takam.\ncollected in Japan, the fungus was identified as E. salmonii. This\nidentification was confirmed using molecular phylogenetic analysis. This\nis the first report of E. salmonii not only in Ukraine but also in\nEurope. It is suggested that the records of E. fraxinicola collected\nfrom Belarus and Russia could be mis-identification and should be\ncorrected to E. salmonii. In 2016, the fungus was found not only in Kyiv\nbut also in north-eastern outskirts of the town. Its development has\nfeatured epiphytotic. Thus, E. salmonii may be an invasive species to\nUkraine and expected to be found in Western Europe as well in near\nfuture.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fraxinus ITS+28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103704.phy"}]}
