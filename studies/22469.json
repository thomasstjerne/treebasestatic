The objective of the\npresent study was to identify the species of Colletotrichum associated\nwith anthracnose in fruits of passion fruit based on molecular and\nmorphological characterization. Nine Colletotrichum isolates were\nobtained from fruits with typical symptoms of the disease collected in\nthe state of Alagoas, Brazil. For molecular characterization,\nmulti-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed with partial sequences\nof the GAPDH, β-TUB, ACT, CAL, SOD, CHS genes and ITS-rDNA region. For\nmorpho-cultural characterization, mycelial growth, coloration of\ncolonies, size and shape of conidia and appressoria of the selected\nisolates, were evaluated. Multi-locus analyses along with\nmorpho-cultural characteristics confirmed the species C. fructicola, C.\ntheobromicola and C. brevisporum as responsible for causing anthracnose\nin fruits of passion fruit in the state of Alagoas, Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"FIG 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BI analysis of colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_110641.phy"}]}
