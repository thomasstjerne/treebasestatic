Heptathela nishihirai; Heptathelidae: Mesothelae). Sequence\ndivergence ranges from 3-4% among Cupiennius species and up to 36% in\npairwise comparisons of the more distantly related spider DNAs.\nMaximally parsimonious gene trees based on these sequences indicate that\nPhoneutria and Cupiennius are the most distantly related species of the\nexamined Lycosoidea. The monophyly of the family Ctenidae is therefore\ndoubted; and a revision of the family, which should include DNA-data, is\nneeded.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"RTA clade","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1320.phy"}]}
