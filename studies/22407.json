The series provides\nmorphological descriptions and information regarding the pathology,\ndistribution, hosts and disease symptoms for the treated genera. In\naddition, primary and secondary DNA barcodes for the currently accepted\nspecies are included. This second paper in the GOPHY series treats 20\ngenera of phytopathogenic fungi and their relatives including:\nAllantophomopsiella, Apoharknessia, Cylindrocladiella, Diaporthe,\nDichotomophthora, Gaeumannomyces, Harknessia, Huntiella,\nMacgarvieomyces, Metulocladosporiella, Microdochium, Oculimacula,\nParaphoma, Phaeoacremonium, Phyllosticta, Proxypiricularia, Pyricularia,\nStenocarpella, Utrechtiana and Wojnowiciella. This study includes the\nnew genus Pyriculariomyces, 20 new species, five new combinations, and\nsix typifications for older names.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytopathogenic Fungi PhyM","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123370.phy"},{"tree_label":"BIT","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytopathogenic Fungi PhyloBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123371.phy"}]}
