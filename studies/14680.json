Evidence for such range dynamics and\nrefugia in the unglaciated Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain stems largely\nfrom terrestrial species, and aquatic species Pleistocene responses\nremain relatively uninvestigated. Heterandria formosa, a wide-ranging\nregional endemic, presents an ideal system to test the\nexpansion-contraction model within this biota. By integrating ecological\nniche modeling and phylogeography, we infer the Pleistocene history of\nthis livebearing fish (Poeciliidae) and test for several predicted\ndistributional and genetic effects of the last glaciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66408","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66408.phy"},{"tree_label":"Htimetree","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66450","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66450.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr66409","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_66409.phy"}]}
