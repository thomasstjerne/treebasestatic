Phylo- genetic trees of these fungal members were\nconstructed from nucleotide sequences of this region. The so-called\ngeniculata group of Curvularia was separated into several clusters. The\nconidial morphology of the members in each cluster is closely similar\nbut clearly different among discrete clusters. The phylogenetic groups\nalmost concurred with the morphological grouping. Thus, the synonymous\ntreat- ment of Curvularia affinis, C. fallax, and C. senegalensis to C.\ngeniculata in a previous study was supported. The iso- lates with\nwarping hilum conidia were clearly different from C. geniculata and\nseparated into two clusters. C. geniculata ATCC 6671 made an independent\ncluster situated near these clusters. The protuberant hilum species were\nlocated separately in the phylogenetic trees. For sound taxonomic\ntreatment of these isolates, we should accumulate more information and\nretain our species determination for them.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Curvularia geniculata group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_704.phy"}]}
