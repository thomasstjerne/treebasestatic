We focus on resolving the\ncircumscriptions of some large Neotropical genera by focusing on a\nclade, identified in previous analyses, that includes the monophyletic\ngenus Melpomene, plus portions of two polyphyletic genera, Lellingeria\nand Terpsichore. Phylogenetic analyses using chloroplast markers atpB,\nrbcL, and trnL-F, along with 109 morphological characters, resolve this\ningroup as monophyletic and sister to a clade that includes Ceradenia,\nEnterosora, and Zygophlebia. We use morphological characters included in\nthe analysis to circumscribe clades. Melpomene is clearly monophyletic,\nbut forms a polytomy with Lellingeria s.l. in a strict consensus of MP\ntrees. Ingroup species of Terpsichore form three well supported\nmonophyletic groups that together are paraphyletic with respect to\nMelpomene plus Lellingeria. Two clades corresponding to species groups\nof Terpsichore will be recognized as new genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"177","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Grammitid Ferns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_19939.phy"}]}
