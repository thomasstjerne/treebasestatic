The genus Tylodontia, based\non T. cubensis, is a small genus restricted to Cuba. Besides T.\ncubensis, the genus comprises T. fusculum, a species formerly assigned\nto Metastelma; T. urceolata, a species formerly assigned to Astephanus,\nand a new species, T. stipitata. The second lineage is described as the\nnew genus Anemotrochus and comprises the widespread Carribean\nAnemotrochus eggersii, a plant formerly placed in Metastelma.\nAnemotrochus comprises three species, one of them, A. yamanigueyensis,\ndiscovered by the authors in Eastern Cuba, is described as new. The\ninclusion of the third species, A. viridivenius from Hispaniola, a plant\nformerly ascribed to Matelea, is supported by both morphological and\nmolecular data. Tylodontia and Anemotrochus are members of the wider\nMatelea alliance, but form lineages independent from each other and from\nMatelea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylodontia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77250.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"156","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tylodontia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77251.phy"}]}
