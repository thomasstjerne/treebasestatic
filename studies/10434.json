This\nplant is susceptible to a number of fungal diseases of which the most\nsevere is fusariosis. The disease is caused by Fusarium guttiforme and\noccurs only in South and Central America. The occurrence of a similar\ndisease on pineapples in South Africa has prompted a re-evaluation of\nthe Fusarium spp. associated with pineapple fruit rot. Phylogenetic\nrelationships of isolates from pineapples collected in Brazil and South\nAfrica were assessed based on sequence data for the translation\nelongation factor-1α, histone H3 and β-tubulin gene regions. Analyses\nshowed that the South African isolates represent a species distinct from\nBrazilian isolates. The South African isolates are characterised by a\nconcentration of aerial mycelium at the centres of the colonies,\ndifferent to the Brazilian isolates that have an even distribution of\naerial mycelium. Both phylogenetic and morphological data show that the\ndisease on pineapple in South Africa is caused by a new Fusarium species\ndescribed here as F. ananatum sp nov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8633","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8633.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8635","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8635.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr8634","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_8634.phy"}]}
