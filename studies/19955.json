Pholiota linzhiensis is recognized by its pileus covered with\nradially appressed fibrillose squamules, stipe with subfloccose to\nrecurved scales; yellow and thick-walled pleurocystidia, as well as\noblong and sometimes pyriform spores. The species is described and\nillustrated, and a phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer\nnuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) is presented. Both the morphology and the\nphylogenetic analysis showed that P. linzhiensis belongs to Pholiota\nsubgenus Flammuloides section Lubricae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Pholiota Bayesian analysis","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98773","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98773.phy"},{"tree_label":"Pholiota Bayesian analysis","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98774","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98774.phy"}]}
