Especially common in open vegetation areas,\nincluding urban environments, Hypotrachyna isidiociliata sp. nov. is\nmorphologically and chemically similar to H. horrescens. Nevertheless,\nphylogenetic analyses of the nuITS and mtSSU regions revealed that H.\nisidiociliata is a distinct species and closely related to the North\nAmerican H. mcmulliniana, differing by the size of its laciniae and\nascospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131225","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_131225.phy"}]}
