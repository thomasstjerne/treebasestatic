In the present study several isolates, which have been baited\nfrom soils from various parts of the world, are compared based on\nmorphology, as well as DNA sequence data from their b-tubulin, histone,\nelongation factor 1-a and calmodulin gene regions. As a result of these\nstudies, eight new species with sphaeropedunculate vesicles and\n1-septate conidia are described. An emended key is provided to\ndistinguish these species from others in the Cy. floridanum species\ncomplex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria species and their Cylindrocladium\nanamorphs, 1/64 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_557.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria species and their Cylindrocladium\nanamorphs, 1/24 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_640.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Calonectria species and their Cylindrocladium\nanamorphs, 1/12 MPTs","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_687.phy"}]}
