Understanding the degree of\ngenetic diversity within C. truncatum population will provide insights\ninto the ability of this species to evolve in response to environmental\nconditions and thus be helpful in designing effective control strategies\nfor this pathogen. In this study, sequence tagged microsatellite markers\nfrom 27 loci were used to investigate genetic diversity and population\nstructure analysis among 99 isolates of C. truncatum from India. All the\nloci were polymorphic and a total of 140 different alleles were\namplified. Six distinct populations were obtained based on UPGMA cluster\nanalysis. Population V showed highest level of genetic diversity. AMOVA\nanalysis showed that the variation occurs mostly within populations.\nMicrosatellite markers based genetic diversity estimation revealed high\ndiversity among C. truncatum isolates from India.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105740","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105740.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105741","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105741.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105742","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105742.phy"}]}
