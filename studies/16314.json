Although\nthese fungi are common in Iran, they have generally been poorly studied\nand no cultures have been preserved for molecular analyses. The present\npaper represents the first study of Pseudocercospora species from Iran\nevaluated by employing the Consolidated Species Concept. Nineteen\nisolates were obtained from seven host plant families in the northern\nzone of Iran. A phylogenetic analysis based on a combination of LSU,\nITS, TEF-1α and ACT loci clustered these isolates into eight clades, of\nwhich five are phylogenetically new, delineating two novel species,\nviz. P. mazandaranensis on Nerium oleander and P. sophoricola on Sophora\nalopecuroides. Furthermore, P. punicae is recorded on a wild-grown\ncultivar of Punica granatum, and two additional species reported, namely\nPseudocercospora sp. A on Phaseolus vulgaris and Pseudocercospora sp. B\non Diospyros lotus. Pseudocercospora norchiensis is recorded for the\nfirst time in Asia, where it occurs on a wide host range, contrary to\nmost other species of Pseudocercospora, which appear to be highly host\nspecific.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudocercospora spp. from Iran","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80093.phy"}]}
