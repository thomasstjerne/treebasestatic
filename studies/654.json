In one case Kaira is sister genus to Metepeira,\nand Zygiella is sister to Kaira plus Metepeira; in another case, Kaira\nis sister genus to Metepeira, but Zygiella is a tetragnathid, and thus\nunrelated at this level of analysis; and in the last case, Zygiella is\nclose to Metepeira, but this time Kaira is not closely related. To\nresolve among these conflicting hypotheses, six species of orb-weaving\nspiders were sequenced for mitochondrial DNA encoding a portion of the\n12S ribosomal subunit. These data were analyzed with data from two\ntetragnathid orb-weavers to estimate the phylogenetic relationships\namong these spiders and to determine which genus is a likely sister\ngroup to Metepeira. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony supports the\nhypothesis that Kaira is a likely sister group to Metepeira and that\nZygiella is in the family Araneidae rather than the family\nTetragnathidae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Araneidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3631.phy"}]}
