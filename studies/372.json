The aim of this study\nwas to determine the phylogenetic relationships among strains of C.\ncubensis and the related species C. parasitica, Endothia eugeniae and E.\ngyrosa using DNA sequence data. A second objective was to develop a\nrapid diagnostic method to distinguish among these taxa. The variable\nITS1 and ITS2 regions, as well as the conserved 5.8S gene of the rRNA\noperon, were amplified and sequenced. The amplified PCR products were\nalso used in Alu I and Cfo I restriction digests. Analysis of the\nrestriction profiles indicate that it is possible to distinguish between\nC. cubensis, C. parasitica, E. eugeniae and E. gyrosa using RFLPs\n(restriction fragment length polymorphisms). This will facilitate the\nidentification of isolates thought to represent C. cubensis that\nsporulate poorly in culture. Analysis of the sequence data showed that\nC. cubensis isolates form a distinct clade that includes a strain from\nclove that might otherwise have been assigned the name E. eugeniae.\nIsolates of C. parasitica formed a separate clade. Endothia gyrosa\ngrouped separately from both C. cubensis and C. parasitica.
