The\nanalysis was based on four plastid markers: rbcL, rps4-trnS, trnG-trnR,\nand trnL-trnF. Two of the most closely related families to the\nDryopteridaceae (Didymochlaenaceae and Hypodematiaceae) and 12\ndryopteroid genera were used as outgroups. Eight morphological\ncharacters were mapped on the resulting tree. Stigmatopteris was\nrecovered as monophyletic and sister to a clade formed by polystichoid\nferns such as Arachniodes, Dryopteris, and Polystichum. Synapomorphies\nthat distinguish Stigmatopteris are 1-pinnate-pinnatifid laminae,\nvisible punctate glands in the mesophyll, the presence of hydathodes,\nuniseriate cilia on the scale margins, and loss of indusia. Within the\ngenus are two main clades. The first consists of four species\ncharacterized by pinnae long-decurrent in at least the distal third of\nthe lamina. The second consists of the remaining 17 species in the\nanalysis and has no known morphological synapomorphies. Nested within\nthis second clade is a subclade of six species endemic to southeastern\nBrazil. Anastomosing veins, a character often used in keys to\ndistinguish the species, evolved four times within the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stigmatopteris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96075.phy"}]}
