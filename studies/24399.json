These isolates\npresent a new and previously undescribed species in this section which\nis illustrated and described here as Alternaria ershadii. Based on our\nphylogenetic studies, four species viz.Â Alternaria arrhenatheri, A.\nkordkuyana, A. parvicaespitosa and A. rosae can be placed in this\nsection, but A. brassicifolii, which is recently described from Brassica\nrapa subsp. pekinensis in Korea and placed in this section, is formed a\nwell separated monotypic lineage distinct from the members of this\nsection. Comparisons with other species in the section Pseudoalternaria\nare provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117312","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117312.phy"}]}
