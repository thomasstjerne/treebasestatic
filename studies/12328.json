To\ninfer natural species groups in this alliance we here provide a plastid\nphylogeny and we then use the phylogenetic framework to address the\nroles of polyploidy, growth form changes, and changes in flower traits\nrelated to pollination mode.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"162","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Echinopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55524.phy"}]}
