However, only two taxonomic groups (Epichloe festucae\nvar. lolii and LpTG-2) have so far been described. In addition to these\ntwo well-characterised species, a third distinct group of previously\nunclassified perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes was identified as\nbelonging to a putative novel taxon (or taxa) (PNT) in a previous\nanalysis based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker diversity. In\naddition to genotypic differences, distinctive alkaloid production\nprofiles were observed for members of the PNT class. Results: A detailed\nphylogenetic analysis of perennial ryegrass-associated endophytes using\ncomponents of whole genome sequence data was performed using complete\nsequences of 7 nuclear protein-encoding genes. Three independently\nselected genes (encoding a DEAD/DEAH box helicase [Sbp4], a glycosyl\nhydrolase [family 92 protein] and a MEAB protein), none of which have\nbeen previously used for biosystematic studies of endophytes, were\nselected together with the frequently used ‘house-keeping’ genes tefA\nand tubB (encoding translation elongation factor 1-a and β-tubulin,\nrespectively). In addition, two classes of endophyte-specific gene (perA\nfor peramine biosynthesis and MT for mating-type control) were included.\nThe results supported previous phylogenomic inferences for the known\nspecies, but distinctive patterns of diversity for the previously\nunclassified endophyte strains, which were further proposed to belong\nnot one but two distinct novel taxa. Potential progenitor genomes for\nthe asexual endophytes among contemporary anamorphic (Epichloë) species\nwere also identified from the phylogenetic analysis. Conclusions: Unique\ntaxonomic status for the PNT was confirmed through comparison of\nmultiple nuclear gene sequences, and also supported by evidence from\nchemotypic diversity. Analysis of MT gene idiomorphs further supported a\npredicted independent origin of two distinct perennial\nryegrass-associated novel taxa, designated LpTG-3 and LpTG-4, from\ndifferent members of a similar founder population related to\ncontemporary E. festucae. The analysis also provided higher resolution\nto the known progenitor contributions of previously characterised\nperennial ryegrass-associated endophyte taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof perA gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85824.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 2","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using MLanalysis\nof tefA gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof tubB gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85823.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof MEAB gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85826.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof DEAD gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85827.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof concatenated gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85828.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional file 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof the mtbA MT gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85829.phy"},{"tree_label":"Figure 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using ML analysis\nof glycosyl hydrolase gene sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85825.phy"},{"tree_label":"Additional file 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bootstrap consensus tree constructed using the ML\nanalysis of concatenated gene sequence (tubB, tefA, DEAD, glycosyl\nhydrolase and MEAB)","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85830.phy"}]}
