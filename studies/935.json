In order to render all 11 robinioid\ngenera monophyletic, the genus Hybosema is synonymized with Gliricidia,\nand the genus Poissonia is resurrected to accommodate four\nmorphologically disparate species previously classified in Coursetia.\nThree new combinations are required to accommodate these two generic\nrecircumscriptions: Gliricidia robustum, Poissonia heterantha, and\nPoissonia weberbaueri. Ages of clades and evolutionary substitution\nrates are derived from a rate-smoothed Bayesian likelihood approach on\nsequences from the ITS region and the matK locus. Time constraints are\nderived from the Tertiary fossil wood species Robinia zirkelii , which\nshares apomorphic wood characters with the Robinia stem clade. The Cuban\nendemic Hebestigma is estimated to have diverged at least 38 Ma from its\nMesoamerican sister genus Lennea, whereas the Greater Antillean Poitea\nis estimated to have diverged at least 16 Ma from its continental sister\nGliricidia. This study reveals that sequences from the ITS region are\namenable to exhaustive taxon sampling because of the high levels of\nvariation at and below the species level. The evolutionary substitution\nrate for the ITS region is estimated at 3.1-3.5 x 10-9\nsubstitutions/site/year, approximately an order of magnitude faster than\nthat estimated for the matK locus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"morph ITS trnL indels matK","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_828.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_827.phy"},{"tree_label":"Morphology ITS 5.8s","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_823.phy"},{"tree_label":"morph, ITS 5.8s, trnL intron","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_824.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_825.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1-3","ntax":"178","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Robinioid legumes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_826.phy"}]}
