In addition,\ndrug-trafficking and injection drug use began to rise, leading to the\npropagation and transmission of blood-borne infections within and across\nthe FSU countries. To examine the transmission of blood-borne infections\nwithin this region, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of\npublically available sequences of two blood-borne viruses, hepatitis C\nvirus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), from FSU countries.\nMethods: We analysed 614 and 295 NS5B sequences from HCV genotypes 1b\nand 3a, respectively from 9 FSU countries. From 13 FSU countries, we\nanalysed 347 HIV gag and 1282 HIV env sequences. To examine transmission\nnetworks and the origins of infection, respectively, phylogenetic and\nBayesian analyses were performed. Results: Our analysis shows\nintermixing of HCV and HIV sequences, suggesting transmission of these\nviruses both within and across FSU countries. We show involvement of\nthree major populations in transmission: injection drug user,\nheterosexual, and trans-border migrant. Conclusion: This study\nhighlights the need to focus harm reduction efforts toward controlling\ntransmission of blood-borne infections among the above-mentioned\nhigh-risk populations in the FSU countries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"623","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119295","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_119295.phy"}]}
