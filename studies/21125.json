DNA\nbarcoding was expected to be an effective tool for species\nidentification in Eucalyptus. Fourteen Eucalyptus species were selected\nfrom the forest-breeding program in Brazil and tested four regions in\nthe plastid genome (matK, rbcL, rpoC1 and ycf1), a nuclear transcribed\nspacer (ITS1+ITS2, herein ITS region) and their combinations, in order\nto discriminate them at species level. Among the evaluated loci, ITS,\nrbcL, rpoC1, matK had the highest success rate for amplification (100%),\nfollowed by a low percentage of success by ycf1 (65.71%). The “best\nmatch” and “best close match” approaches revealed a rate of correct\nspecies identification matK+ITS (61.64%) followed by ycf1+ITS and\nycf1+ITS+matK (61.53%). Neighbour-joining cluster analysis indicated the\nhighest degree of the 25 possible combinations of the five regions;\nthree provided the highest degree of species resolution (79%). Among\nthese, a combination of ITS+rbcL, ITS+matK+rpoC1 and ITS+rbcL+rpoC1,\nwhich comprises two and three DNA regions, is the best option for\nbarcoding of Eucalyptus species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105187","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105187.phy"}]}
