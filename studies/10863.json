A survey of the presence or absence of the\nrpoC1 intron in 136 species representing 17 of Killips (1938) 22\nsubgenera of Passiflora and four other genera in the Passifloraceae\nrevealed intron losses in 46 taxa. A minimum of two losses were\nconfirmed by a parametric bootstrap approach on sequence data from the\ntrnL/trnT chloroplast non-coding region for 61 taxa. The results of\nphylogenetic analyses of the trnL/trnT sequence data support the\nreduction of Killips 22 subgenera to four as proposed in a new\nclassification system by Feuillet and MacDougal (2004). The monophyly of\nthe ‘n􏰄6’ and ‘n􏰄9’ chromosomal and morphological groups is strongly\nsupported. In addition, these data indicate that Passiflora biflora, or\nclosely related species, is the likely continental sister to the\nred-flowered Caribbean taxa, while P. auriculata is weakly supported as\nthe New World sister to the Old World Passifloras. Finally, character\noptimization of chromosome numbers on the phylogenetic tree supports\nx􏰄12 as the base chromosome number for Passiflora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. D","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Passiflora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21527.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. B","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Passiflora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21529.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. C","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Passiflora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21528.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. A","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Passiflora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21530.phy"}]}
