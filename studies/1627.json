The\nphylogenies of the mating-type genes yielded better resolutions than\nthat of 18S rDNA. Entomopathogens (Cordyceps bassiana, Cordyceps\nbrongniartii, Cordyceps militaris, Cordyceps sinclairii, Cordyceps\ntakaomontana, Isaria cateniannulata, Isaria farinosa, Isaria\nfumosorosea, Isaria javanica, Lecanicillium muscarium and Torrubiella\nflava) were considered as a phylogenetically defined group, and were\nclosely related to mycopathogens (Lecanicillium psalliotae and\nVerticillium fungicola). They located at more descendant positions in\nthe mating-type trees than other fungi, and lacked the mating-type gene\nMAT1-1-3. The deletion of MAT1-1-3 was supposed to have occurred once in\nClavicipitaceae, and a good indication for the evolution of\nClavicipitaceae. Other entomopathogens (Cordyceps cylindrica, Cordyceps\nsubsessilis, Metarhizium anisopliae and Nomuraea rileyi) and pathogens\nof plants, nematodes and slime molds, were relatively related to each\nother, and possessed MAT1-1-3, but were supposed to be heterogeneous.\nRoot-associated fungi did not form any clade with other species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae, 18S rDNA tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_258.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae, MAT1-1-1 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_326.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clavicipitaceae, MAT1-2-1 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_756.phy"}]}
