In direct contra- diction with the long accepted view of\nEuchordates, this new phylogenetic hypothesis for chordate evolution has\nbeen the object of some skepticism. We assembled an expanded\nphylogenomic dataset focused on deuterostomes. Maximum-likelihood using\nstandard models and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using the CAT\nsite-heterogeneous mixture model of amino-acid replacement both provided\nunequivocal support for the sister-group relationship between tunicates\nand vertebrates (Olfactores). Chordates were recovered as monophyletic\nwith cephalochordates as the most basal lineage. These results were\nrobust to both gene sampling and missing data. New analyses of ribosomal\nrRNA also recovered Olfactores when compositional bias was alleviated.\nDespite the inclusion of 25 taxa representing all major lineages, the\nmonophyly of deuterostomes remained poorly supported. The implications\nof these phylogenetic results for interpreting chordate evolution are\ndiscussed in light of recent advances from evolutionary developmental\nbiology and genomics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chordate Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50676.phy"}]}
