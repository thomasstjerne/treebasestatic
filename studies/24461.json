In this study, we used\n12S ribosomal RNA gene partial sequences to identify specimens of\nleopard frogs from some new localities (not sampled on previous studies)\nof the Southern Mexican Plateau, to carry out a phylogenetic analysis,\nand also a morphometric analysis of some morphological features were\nanalysed to evaluate their morphological variation. A phylogenetic\nanalysis using partial sequences of 12S rDNA mitochondrial gene for 31\nsamples was carried out using Bayesian Inference, Maximum Parsimony, and\nMaximum Likelihood. In addition, 20 morphological lineal measurements\nfrom 97 specimens were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to\nevaluate if the frogs studied are conspecific. Partial sequences of the\n12S rDNA obtained from frogs distributed in the Southern Mexican Plateau\nshow two haplotypes with a divergence of 0.4%. Phylogenetic hypothesis\nshows an exclusive group with a previous sequence of Lithobates\nmontezumae. The PCA indicates that variables are not linearly correlated\nand specimens belong to a single group. Evidence found, let us consider\nthat specimens studied belong to one species of the Lithobates\nmontezumae subgroup, distributed principally in the Southern Mexican\nPlateau.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajorityRule_BI_324bp","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MajorityRule_BI_324bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117998.phy"},{"tree_label":"BestTree_ML_324bp","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BestTree_ML_324bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117999.phy"},{"tree_label":"ConsensusStrict_MP_324bp","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ConsensusStrict_MP_324bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118000.phy"},{"tree_label":"ConsensusStrict_MP_746bp","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ConsensusStrict_MP_746bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118003.phy"},{"tree_label":"MayorityRule_BI_746bp","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MayorityRule_BI_746bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118001.phy"},{"tree_label":"BestTree_ML_746bp","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"BestTree_ML_746bp","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118002.phy"}]}
