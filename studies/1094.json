Separate analyses of each data set produced mainly\ncongruent clades when P. x confusa and the Chinese accession of P.\nhookeriana were excluded. Analysis of the combined data indicated that\ntraditional divisions of the genus into various subgenera and sections\nare supported when they are based on apomorphic characters. Sections\nfound to be paraphyletic are based on homoplasious and plesiomorphic\ncharacters. For a subgeneric classification of Pleione based on\nphylogenetic relationships three groups are suggested. Taxa within the\nP. bulbocodioides complex do not show much molecular divergence. Pleione\nmaculata and P. praecox are proposed to be the paternal and maternal\nparent of P. x lagenaria, respectively, as their nuclear and plastid\ngenomes were almost identical to their natural hybrid. Furthermore, DNA\nsequences confirm the paternal and maternal parent origin of P. x\nconfusa from P. forrestii and P. albiflora as already suggested by\nmorphological and karyotype data. Molecular data are not conclusive\nabout parentages of P. x taliensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pleione","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1295.phy"}]}
