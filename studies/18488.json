In this study, we\nphylogenetically demonstrated the position of Synnemapestaloides as a\ndistinct genus in the Discosiaceae of Amphisphaeriales based on internal\ntranscribed spacer and beta-tubulin sequences. The closest described\ngenus to Synnemapestaloides is Seimatosporium and the closest recognized\nspecies is Seimatosporium foliicola. Based on molecular data, Sei.\nfoliicola should be transferred out of Seimatosporium and placed as a\nseparate genus. Thus, this indicates that the species of the genus\nSeimatosporium are paraphyletic. These results demonstrated that\nanamorphs of Discosiaceae can have pycnidia, acervuli, or\nsynnemata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fig.1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_91893.phy"}]}
