Macro- and micro- characteristics, together with\nanalysis of combined ITS and LSU sequence data, showed that the\nspecimens all belong to a single new species. The new species is\ndistinguished from the remaining taxa in Lycoperdon by its greyish white\nto dark grey exoperidium covered by minute and blackish grey granules,\nsmooth to wrinkled endoperidium, non-chambered subgleba and echinate\nbasidiospores with a short pedicel. Lycoperdon and its intergeneric\nclassification are poorly understood due to the overlap of morphological\ncharacters in subgenera and lack of DNA sequence data to infer\nphylogenetic relationships. The main objective of the present paper is\nto introduce a novel species, Lycoperdon mengsongensis. We also fill the\ngap of the current knowledge on the phylogenetic position of Morganella\nin Lycoperdon. Comprehensive morphological descriptions, color\nphotographs of macro- and micro- characteristics and a phylogenetic tree\nare provided to show the placement of the new species. In addition, the\nnew species is compared with closely related taxa in Lycoperdon subgenus\nMorganella","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr120786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_120786.phy"}]}
