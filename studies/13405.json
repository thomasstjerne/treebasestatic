The\nmaritime genera Halotthia, Pontoporeia and Mauritiana as well as our\nnewly collected species form a monophyletic clade in phylograms\ngenerated from LSU rDNA sequence analysis. This clade has undetermined\nfamilial status and our new species is not congeneric with Halotthia,\nPontoporeia or Mauritiana. A new monotypic genus, Phaeoseptum\n(represented by P. aquaticum sp. nov), is therefore introduced to\naccommodate the newly collected freshwater taxon. A new family,\nHalotthiaceae, is introduced to accommodate these four aquatic genera,\ni.e.Â Halotthia, Mauritiana, Phaeoseptum and Pontoporeia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"rep.1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57338","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57338.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.1000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57339.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.2000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57340.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.3000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57341","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57341.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.4000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57342","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57342.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.5000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57343","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57343.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.6000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57344","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57344.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.7000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57345","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57345.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.8000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57346","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57346.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.9000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57347","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57347.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.10000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57348","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57348.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.11000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57349","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57349.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.12000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57350","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57350.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.13000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57351","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57351.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.14000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57352","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57352.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.15000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57353.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.16000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57354","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57354.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.17000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57355","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57355.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.18000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57356","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57356.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.19000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57357","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57357.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.20000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57358","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57358.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.21000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57359","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57359.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.22000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57360","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57360.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.23000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57361","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57361.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.24000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57362","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57362.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.25000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57363","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57363.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.26000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57364","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57364.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.27000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57365","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57365.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.28000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57366","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57366.phy"},{"tree_label":"rep.10000000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr57367","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_57367.phy"}]}
