However, in the protologue a second,\nmorphologically different but closely related form is mentioned, found\nin association with Nothofagus s.l. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS\nsequences, indicates that both the Leptospermum- and\nNothofagus-associated forms are nested within Cortinarius, but that the\ntwo forms are distinct species. Cortinarius peraurantiacus is related to\nthe Australian species Protoglossum luteum, and the southern\nbeech-associated form is sister an undescribed hypogeous Cortinarius\nfrom Tasmania and these are related to the New Zealand native\nCortinarius dulciolens. Cortinarius beeverorum sp. nov. is described and\nillustrated, to accommodate the southern beech-associated form.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian tree","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_69231.phy"}]}
