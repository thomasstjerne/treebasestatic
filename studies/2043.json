They have been the focus of intense\nbehavioral ecological research since the 1980s yet no thorough\nphylogenetic estimate for the group exists. The relationships among the\nspecies, and the validity of some species, are poorly understood. Here,\nwe infer the relationships and examine species boundaries among 50\nindividuals representing 15 species, primarily of the investigator\nspecies group, using a mixture-model Bayesian analysis. Two\nmitochondrial genes, COI and COII, were used, providing 2,129 aligned\nnucleotides (567 parsimony-informative). The Akaike Information\nCriterion and Bayes Factors were used to select the best fitting model,\nin addition to Reversible Jump MCMC, which accommodated model\nuncertainty. A 21 parameter, three partition GTR+G was the final model\nchosen. Despite a presumed Old World origin for the genus itself, the\nbasal lineages and immediate outgroups of the investigator species group\nare New World species. Bayesian methods reconstruct the common ancestor\nof the investigator species group as New World and imply one later\ntransition to the Old World with two return transitions to the New\nWorld. Prior hypotheses concerning the questionable validity of four\nspecies names, N. praedator, N. confusus, N. encaustus and N. mexicanus\nwere tested. No evidence was found for the validity of the N.\ninvestigator synonym N. praedator. We found evidence rejecting the\nspecies status of N. confusus (NEW SYNONYM of N. sepultor). Weak\nevidence was found for the species status of N. encaustus and N.\nmexicanus, which are tentatively retained as valid. Our results strongly\nreject a recently published hypothesis that N. interruptus (NEW STATUS\nas valid species) is a subspecies of N. investigator.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 COI","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nicrophorus COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4 COII","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nicrophorus COII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5167.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5, 6","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nicrophorus COI&COII","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5168.phy"}]}
