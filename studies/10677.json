Phylogenetic analysis showed that these two\nITS types do not share a common ancestor and form separate clades.\nK-type on Ligustrum was identified as Erysiphe ligustri by its unique\nthree dimensional branching pattern of appendages. Morphological\nobservations showed that there are some morphological differences,\nviz. pigmentation of appendages and number of ascospores per ascus,\nbetween S-type and K-type on Syringa. Based on the morphological\nobservations, S-type and K-type on Syringa were identified as E.\nsyringae and E. syringae-japonicae, respectively. Recent abundant\nproduction of chasmothecia by lilac mildew in Europe may have caused by\nE. syringae-japonicae introduced from East Asia. DNA sequence analyses\nof rDNA ITS region, 28S rDNA, mitochondria SSU rDNA, tub2, CYP51, and\nChs1 genes did not support interspecific hybrid origin of E.\nsyringae-japonicae. Haplotype analysis suggested North America as a\ngeographic origin of E. syringae and its independent migration to East\nAsia and Europe/South America.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_19965.phy"}]}
