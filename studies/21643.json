In this\nstudy, the new species, C. acaciae and C. coluteae, are introduced from\ndead branches of Acacia sp. and Colutea paulsenii (both Fabaceae) from\nUzbekistan based on sexual and asexual characters and phylogenetic\nstudies. Analysis of combined ITS and LSU sequence data with\nGenealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR),\nprovide evidence for these new species placement in Coniochaeta, but as\ndistinct lineages with the comparison of similar taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107321","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107321.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107322","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107322.phy"}]}
