Both phylogenetic molecular and morphological analysis\nrevealed them as two undescribed species, presented hereafter.\nPhylloporia elegans sp. nov. and P. nodostipitata sp. nov. mainly differ\nfrom P. spathulata by presenting reviving basidiomata, with smaller\npores and basidiospores. Phylloporia nodostipitata develops cespitose\nbasidiomata, with nodose and flexuous stipes and tomentose upper\nsurface. Phylloporia elegans develops individual basidiomata, with\ncylindrical and straight stipes, and an upper surface as a\nplagiotrichoderm. Both species are described, illustrated, discussed and\ncompared with Phylloporia spathulata based on its type study.\nAdditionally, some taxonomic notes on P. spathulata are presented in\norder to improve its morphological delimitation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91767","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91767.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91768","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91768.phy"}]}
