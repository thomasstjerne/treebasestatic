The entire MAT idiomorphs\nand flanking regions of Ulocladium, a genus thought to be strictly\nasexual, were sequenced and characterized for the first time. Both\nMAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 genes were detected within the same genome of\nUlocladium species, which are structurally similar to a homothallic\nspecies. Moreover, both MAT genes were expressed and might be functional\nin the asexual genus Ulocladium, indicated the potential for sexual\nreproduction in Ulocladium species. To evaluate the phylogenetic\npotential of mating-type sequences in Ulocladium, phylogenies based on\nMAT genes were compared with GAPDH and Alt a 1 phylograms. MAT genes\nshowed high sequence similarity within genus and low levels of\nconservation between different genera. The MAT genealogies and the\nnon-MAT tree displayed different topologies, suggesting that MAT genes\nwere unsuitable phylogenetic markers in Ulocladium. Furthermore, the\nconflicting topologies between MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1 phylogeny indicated\nthe separate evolutionary event for the two MAT genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60747","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60747.phy"}]}
