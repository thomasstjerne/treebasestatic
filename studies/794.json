The isolates analyzed comprised 21 from eastern\nNorth America, 27 from Asia, one from Europe, and two of unknown\ngeographic origin, one of which was the major US commercial production\nstrain in use. Grifola sordulenta was used as an outgroup. Combined and\nseparate analysis of both genes showed a partition separating Asian\nversus eastern North American isolates. Bootstrap analysis showed strong\nsupport for these clades in the ß-tubulin data alone and in the combined\ndata. The major commercial isolate of unknown geographic origin is\napparently of Asian descent based on its grouping within the Asian\nclade. The single European isolate analyzed was distinct from both the\neastern North American and Asian clades. These results indicate strong\nsupport for a species partition separating eastern North American and\nAsian isolates of G. frondosa, despite previous studies indicating no\nmorphological distinction between them.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Grifola frondosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3926.phy"}]}
