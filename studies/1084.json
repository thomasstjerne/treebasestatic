A confidence set of trees was\nestimated using expected likelihood weights to investigate a series of\nhypotheses of monophyly. Tree topologies were very similar between\nmethods and differed only in the placement of a few poorly supported\nbranches. The results indicate that the Micareaceae in its current\ncircumscription belongs in the Lecanorales, but that it is not\nmonophyletic. Psilolechia, Micarea with a ìnon-micareoidî photobiont,\nMicarea sensu stricto and Byssoloma form a paraphyletic grade in this\nstudy. Micarea sensu stricto and Byssoloma (Pilocarpaceae) form a\nstrongly supported monophyletic group, which constitutes the sister\ngroup to the Bacidiaceae. Scoliciosporum A. Massal has sometimes been\nconsidered close to Micarea, but no support was found here for that\nhypothesis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Micareaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5864.phy"}]}
