It was recently separated from\nthe European H. albidus based on molecular analyses, while\nmorphologically scarcely distinguishable. Hymenoscyphus albidus was\nreported under the nomenclatural synonym Lambertella albida on petioles\nof Fraxinus mandshurica in Japan. The present study reconsidered the\ntaxonomy of L. albida in Japan. Based on a three loci (ITS-5.8S rDNA\nregion, calmodulin gene and translation elongation factor 1-Î± gene)\nphylogenetic analysis, Japanese L. albida was found to be conspecific\nwith H. pseudoalbidus, but showed higher genetic variability compared to\nEuropean isolates. The presence of croziers at the ascus base of both\nEuropean and Japanese H. pseudoalbidus was found to be a clear\ndistinguishing character to separate this species from H. albidus, which\nconsistently lacks croziers. Our phylogenetic analysis of combined\ndataset (ITS and LSU-D1/D2) also suggests that the genus Hymenoscyphus\nis more appropriate than Lambertella to accommodate H. pseudoalbidus,\nand the Hymenoscyphus clade includes members with two major characters\n(presence of substratal stroma and brown ascospores) which have\ncurrently been used to circumscribe the genus Lambertella. Hence, the\ngeneric delimitation of Lambertella requires redefinition.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51829.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51827.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51825.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51821.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51819.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51822.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51828.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51820.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51824.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51823.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51826.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51833.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51831.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lambertella albida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51832.phy"}]}
