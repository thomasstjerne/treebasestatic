The phylogenetic analyses\ninferred from the nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) dataset and the combined\n2-locus dataset [5.8S + nuc 28S rDNA (nLSU)] of taxa of Trechisporales\naround the world, show that Sistotremastraceae forms a monophyletic\nlineage with robust support within Trechisporales. The new family is\ncharacterized by resupinate and thin basidiomata, smooth, verruculose or\nodontioid-semiporoid hymenophore, a monomitic hyphal structure, and\ngenerative hyphae bearing clamp connections, the presence of cystidia\nand hyphidia in some species, thin-walled, smooth, inamyloid and\nacyanophilous basidiospores. In addition, four new species are described\nand illustrated, i.e., Trechispora dentata, T. dimitiella, T. fragilis\nand T. levispora. Besides, three new combinations, i.e., Brevicellicium\ndaweishanensis, B. xanthum and Sertulicium limonadense, are also\nproposed based on examination of type materials and phylogenetic\nanalyses of type sequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134787","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134787.phy"}]}
