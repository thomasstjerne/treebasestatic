Sequences of trnL-trnF intergenic spacer and trnL\nintron were informative in resolving relationships among genera and at\nhigher levels. Three major lineages are identified: the Corylopsis\nlineage, the Trichocladus lineage, and the Hamamelis lineage.\nCorylopsideae, Hamamelideae, and Dicoryphinae are found to be\nmonophyletic; Loropetalinae and Eustigmateae appear to be paraphyletic,\nand Hamamelideae and Fothergilleae to be polyphyletic. These results are\nconsistent with previous analyses based on nrDNA ITS sequences and the\ncpDNA matK gene. Morphological characters, such as apetaly, strap-shaped\npetal, and wind pollination, which have been used to define suprageneric\ngroups, evolved independently in the three lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3496.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hamamelidoideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3495.phy"}]}
