Species of Agaricus section Arvenses are consumed\nthroughout the world and several species of this section, such as A.\nsubrufescens, are cultivated for their nutritional and medicinal\nproperties. Our objective was to investigate the species diversity of\nsection Arvenses in subtropical Southwest China. Among numerous\ncollections we selected 30 wild specimens belonging to eight likely\nspecies of this section. A phylogenetic analysis based on the rDNA-ITS\nregion and including 22 species of section Arvenses from GenBank showed\nthat the section Arvenses was monophyletic and subdivided in five major\nbranches. The branch of A. subrufescens arose near the common ancestor\nof the section, while the other species grouped in four clades (A-D):\nthe four typically tropical species grouped in clade A, the four\nAustralasian species grouped in clade B, and 12 non-tropical species\nfrom the Northern hemisphere clustered in clades C and D, while position\nof A. augustus remained uncertain. Interestingly, the eight species from\nsubtropical Southwest China were distributed in the five branches of the\nsection and were identified as follows. Agaricus guizhouensis (clade D),\nA. longistipes (C), and A. megalocarpus (B) are described as new\nspecies. Agaricus abruptibulbus (D), A. flocculosipes (A), and A.\nsubrufescens are newly reported species for Guizhou Province. Two\nprobable new species are in clade D. The distribution of the eight\nChinese species in five branches of the section indicates that\nsubtropical Southwest China is at the geographic and climatic\ncrossroads. Species in clades C and D which typically have a white or\nyellowish pileus, are common in China, Europe and North America, while\nthey appear to be absent in neighboring tropical areas. The origin of\nthe white pileus trait, the close relationship between the âwhiteâ\nspecies of clade D, and the potential nutritional and medicinal interest\nof the newly revealed biodiversity are discussed. These data based on\nfirst investigations in subtropical Southwest China suggest a potential\nspecies richness that remains to be discovered.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
