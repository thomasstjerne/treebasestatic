Exemplar taxa were selected to represent the all sections\nfrom the current classifications of Singer, Bas and Jenkins.\nPhylogenetic analysis of the nuc-LSU region supports the taxonomic\ndistinction of subgenera Amanita and Lepidella, as well as all nine\nsections previously recognized by Singer (1986) including sections\nAmanita, Amidellae, Caesareae, Lepidella, Mappae, Phalloideae, Ovigerae,\nVaginatae ,Validae. Phylogenetic analyses among these nine terminal\ngroups reveal several higher-level relationships which are also\nsupported by morphological and biochemical characters. A phylogenetic\nclassification is proposed which recognizes two subgenera (Amanita,\nLepidella), four sections (Amanita, Vaginate, Phalloideae, Lepidella),\nseven subsections (Amanita, Ovigerae, Amidellae, Caesareae, Phalloideae,\nVaginatae, Validae), and two series (Mappae, Validae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict consensus","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3409.phy"}]}
