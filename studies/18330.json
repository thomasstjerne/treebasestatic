This\npattern of recent colonizations may explain the worldwide distribution\nof many other organisms in open ecosystems and it is highlighted here as\nan emerging pattern in the evolution of the global flora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"835","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr91245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_91245.phy"}]}
