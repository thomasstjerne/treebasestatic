In the current study, an\nisolate of Fusarium oxysporum was isolated from an infected orchard from\nAswan (Upper Egypt). Pathogenicity testing of the isolate on ten date\npalm varieties from various origins showed that all of them were\nsusceptible to Fusarium oxysporum Aswan but with various degrees.\nCultivars Sakooty and Barhi were the most susceptible, Siwae, Deglet\nNoor and Sagae were moderately resistant. Succary cultivar was the least\nsusceptible one. A mitochondrial molecular marker to test date palm\ngermplasms for resistance/ susceptibility to the Bayoud disease was\napplied in using PCR based on the two primers oli1 and oli2. The results\nrevealed that all germplasms of Egyptian cultivars had susceptibility\nmarker. However, Sakooty and Bartmoda were highly susceptible to\nFusarium oxysporum Aswan, whereas Siwa showed moderate resistance.\nCultivar Deglet Noor whether from Algeria or from Tunisia and Succary\nfrom Saudi Arabia had resistance marker, Succary cultivar was actually\nthe most resistant cultivar to infection with Fusarium oxysporum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 100 from search (criterion: minimize\nTreelength)","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123675","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_123675.phy"}]}
