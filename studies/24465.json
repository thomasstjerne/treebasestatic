The\nspecies was collected from the Mountains of Western Tien Shan and\nSouth-Western Hissar in Uzbekistan. Ophiobolus hydei is characterized by\nglobose to subglobose ascomata with short to long papilla, cylindrical\nto subcylindric-clavate asci, slightly broad pseudoparaphyses, and\nscolecosporous, yellowish brown to brown, filiform, multi-septate\nascospores that the ascospores can be separated into part spores at the\nsepta. Multigene phylogenetic analyses using a combined gene analyses of\nITS, LSU, SSU and TEF1-Î± indicated that the new species is closely\nrelated with Ophiobolus ponticus but differs from closely related\nspecies by its larger ascomata, asci and ascospores with split into part\nspores and its apparent biogeographic range as distributed in semi-arid\nand arid zones in Central Asia. A distribution map, morphological\ndescription and illustration, color photographs of the new species are\nprovided","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121635","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121635.phy"}]}
