In this study,\nClitopilus, Clitocella and Clitopilopsis from China were studied by\nmorphological and phylogenetic methods. Four nuclear markers, namely\nnrLSU, rpb2, tef1-Î± and atp6, were employed to elucidate the\nrelationships of Clitopilus and its allies. The data indicate that\nClitopilus should be divided into three sections, namely section\nClitopilus, section Scyphoides and section Crispi, the last of which is\nnewly erected. In total, seventeen species in Clitopilus and its allies\nare found in China. Fourteen species belong to Clitopilus, of which five\nare new, namely C. yunnanensis, C. brunniceps, C. rugosiceps, C.\nsinoapalus and C. umbilicatus. Two species of Clitocella, including a\nnew species, namely Clitocella orientalis, are described. Furthermore,\nClitopilopsis hirneola is new to China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"126","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clitopilus RPB2+ATP6+LSU+TEF1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119091.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clitopilus RPB2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_119092.phy"}]}
