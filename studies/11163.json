Through the use of molecular markers, the\ndistribution and infestation routes of these nematodes can be better\nelucidated, permitting the development of more effective preventative\nmethods. Here we assess the ability of three molecular markers to\nresolve multiple representatives of five Globodera pallida populations\nas monophyletic groups. Molecular markers included a region of the rbp-1\ngene (a pathogenicity factor), a non-coding nuclear DNA region (the ITS\nregion), and a novel marker for G. pallida, a ~3.4 kb non-coding\nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) region. Multiple phylogenetic analysis methods\nwere performed on the three DNA regions separately, and on a data set of\nthese three regions combined. The analyses of the combined data set were\nsimilar to that of the sole mtDNA marker; resolving more populations as\nmonophyletic groups, relative to that of the ITS region and rbp-1 gene\nregion. This suggests that individual markers may be inadequate for\ndistinguishing populations of G. pallida. The use of this new non-coding\nmtDNA marker may provide further insights into the historical\ndistribution of G. pallida, as well as enable the development of more\nsensitive diagnostic methods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Globodera pallida","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50489.phy"}]}
