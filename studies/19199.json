Morphologically, it differs from known Conioscypha species and\nsimilar taxa in that it has large, turbinate to pyriform, black and\nsmooth-walled conidia. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined partial\nnuclear small and large subunits ribosomal DNA (nuc 18S and nuc 28S) and\nthe second largest subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II largest\nsubunit (RPB2) indicate that this taxon is a member of order\nConioschyphales, Subclass Hypocreomycetidae, Class Sordariomycetes, in a\nwell -supported clade. It formed a sister group to Conioscypha\nlignicola, C. japonica, C. varia and C. peruviana, and shares some\nmorphological characteristics with C. fabiformis and C. taiwaniana. Both\nmorphological and molecular evidence justify the introduction of the new\nspecies, C. nakagirii, and a key to Conioscypha species is also\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr95553","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_95553.phy"}]}
