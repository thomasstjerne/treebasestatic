The genomic genera\nof Love (1984) are one solution, but fully one-third of them are\npolyphyletic, incorporating 2 or more genomes. The suggestion that the\ntribe be considered a single genus (Stebbins, 1956) is theoretically\ndefensible\u001athe genus would be strictly monophyletic\u001abut probably\nimpractical. This paper presents a cladistic analysis of the tribe that\ndiffers from previous analyses in that it uses only strictly\nmonophyletic (monogenomic) groups as terminal taxa; hybrids\n(heterogenomic groups) are shown as reticulations. Monophyletic groups\ncan then be delimited to minimize the number of polyphyletic genera. A\nclassification incorporating genomic information is derived from the\nphylogeny.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Triticeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1665.phy"}]}
