Gene tree parsimony suffers from 10\nserious problems, including differential weighting of nucleotide and gap\ncharacters, undersampling which can be misinterpreted as synapomorphy,\nall of the characters not being allowed to interact, and conflict\nbetween gene trees being given equal weight, regardless of branch\nsupport. These problems are largely avoided by using uninode coding. The\nuninode coding method is elaborated to address multiple gene\nduplications within a single gene tree family and handle problems caused\nby lack of gene tree resolution. An example of vertebrate phylogeny\ninferred from nine genes is reanalyzed using uninode coding. We suggest\nthat uninode coding be used instead of gene tree parsimony for\nphylogenetic inference from paralogous genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Table 1 and appendices 1-8","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vertebrates, strict consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4031.phy"}]}
