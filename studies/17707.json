Yet, information on the\nevolutionary relationships of Neotropical organisms is still scarce and\nlittle is still known about the factors that have shaped the diversity\ncurrently encountered in this region. It is clear, however, that both\nbiotic interactions and abiotic aspects have played important roles for\nspecies diversification in the region. This study focuses on\nDolichandra, a clade of Neotropical lianas that is broadly distributed\nacross different habitats and whose species present diverse pollination\nand dispersal systems. We use sequences from two cpDNA markers (ndhF and\nrpl32-trnL) and one nuclear gene (PepC) to infer the phylogenetic\nrelationships within Dolichandra (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae) using\nparsimony and bayesian approaches. We then use this phylogenetic\nframework as basis to study the biogeographic history, reconstruct the\nevolution of morphological characters, and test the impact of morphology\nand environment on the evolutionary history of the genus. More\nspecifically, we: (i) time-calibrated the phylogeny of Dolichandra, (ii)\nestimated the ancestral areas of the various lineages, (iii) estimated\nthe ancestral states of discrete and continuous morphological traits,\n(iv) tested for phylogenetic signal in environmental and phenotypic\ndata, and (v) evaluated if morphological characters and/or niche\nevolution are correlated with cladogenesis. All species of Dolichandra\nemerged as monophyletic in all analyses; relationships among species are\ngenerally well resolved, although poorly supported in some instances.\nThe genus is inferred to have originated at ca. 31 Mya possibly in the\nEastern portion of South America. Ancestral state reconstructions of\ncontinuous and discrete floral characters inferred a mixed morphology as\nthe ancestral condition for the group. Phylogenetic signal differed\nbetween perianth and sexual whorls and gradual evolution was recovered\nfor all traits, except style length and anther length. Environmental\nvariables showed no phylogenetic signal and a pattern of variation that\nwas not correlated with branch lengths, suggesting that environmental\ntransitions were concomitant with speciation. Dispersion is inferred to\nrepresent the main driver of the differential distribution observed\namong species in the genus. In addition, climatic preferences and floral\ncharacters also seem to have been important reproductive barriers in\nDolichandra.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88166","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88166.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88167","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88167.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88168","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88168.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88169","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88169.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88170.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88172","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88172.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule+","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88171","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88171.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88175","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88175.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88173","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88173.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88174","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88174.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88178.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1+","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88176","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88176.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88177.phy"}]}
