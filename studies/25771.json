The\nisolates were characterized based on DNA comparisons, morphology,\nculture characteristics and host affiliation, in accordance with\nprevious descriptions. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS region, combined\nwith BT and TEF1-α genes, showed that the isolates formed three distinct\ngroups representing three new taxa. The three new species of Diaporthe,\nD. araucanorum on Araucaria araucana, D. foikelawen on Drimys winteri\nand D. patagonica on Aristotelia chilensis are described and illustrated\nin the present study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121804","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121804.phy"}]}
