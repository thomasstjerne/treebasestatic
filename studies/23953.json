Pseudofusicoccum is known only by\nits asexual morph. Here, we provide the sexual morph for\nPseudofusicoccum adansoniae. The sexual morph is characterized by\nimmersed, multiloculate ascomata, cylindric-clavate asci with long\npedicel, well-developed ocular chamber and short clavate, hyaline,\naseptate ascospores, covered with a persistent mucus. The sexual and\nasexual connection of P. adansoniae is confirmed by phylogenetic\nanalyses of a combined ITS, LSU, TEF1 and Î²-tubulin dataset.\nDescriptions, illustrations and molecular data are provided for the\ntaxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudofusicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117900.phy"}]}
