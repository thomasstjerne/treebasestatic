While an infrageneric subdivision into two\nsubgenera is generally accepted, various sectional classifications\nproposed in subg. Caulinia have been controversial. Earlier analyses\nidentified tropical Asia, which harbors more than one-third of all\nspecies, as the area of origin for the genus, but this inference\nrequires re-evaluation using worldwide taxon sampling. Polyploidy has\nbeen widely observed in the genus but its correlation with phylogeny has\nyet to be explored. Here we applied a molecular phylogenetic approach\nusing balanced taxon sampling (1) to test infrageneric classifications,\n(2) to re-assess biogeographic origin, and (3) to explore whether and\nhow polyploidy characterizes evolutionary lineages. Our analyses of\nplastid and nuclear (ITS) DNA datasets produce largely congruent results\nthat recover the two subgenera but find little support for most\nsectional classifications. To overcome this shortfall, we propose a new\nsectional classification of subg. Caulinia. The previously inferred\ntropical Asian origin of the genus is rejected and, instead, North\nAmerica is discerned as the ancestral area, implicating dispersal of the\nmost recent common ancestor of Najas and its sister genera in\nHydrocharitaceae from tropical Asia. Based on chromosome counts\nconfirmed in the present study and those compiled from literature, the\nrole of polyploidization in the evolution of Najas is shown to be\nrelatively limited, in contrast to the extreme infraspecific chromosome\nvariation previously reported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr97965","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97965.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr97966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97966.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97967.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97968","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98121","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98121.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98122","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98122.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97969","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97969.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97970","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_97970.phy"}]}
