The genera\nMagnaporthe and Gaeumannomyces are shown to be polyphyletic and their\nmembers are divided into four major groups based on the phylogenetic\nanalyses. Considering morphological, biological and molecular data, we\nestablish a new genus, Magnaporthiopsis. It is characterized by black\nand globose perithecia with a cylindrical neck, two-layered perithecial\nwall, clavate asci with a refractive apical ring, fusiform to fusoid and\nseptate ascospores, simple hyphopodia, and Harpophora-like anamorph.\nSpecies in this genus are all necrotrophic parasites infecting root of\ngrasses. Three new combinations, Magnaporthiopsis poae, M. rhizophila,\nand M. incrustans, are proposed accordingly. Potential impacts by the\nnew nomenclature (Melbourne code) on the name of the rice blast fungus\nare discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Magnaporthiopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_57947.phy"}]}
