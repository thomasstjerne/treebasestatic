The cause of IBK was\npreviously established as Moraxella bovis, a Gram-negative rod {Henson,\n1960 #330}. In northern California during the summer of 2002, eyes were\ncultured from calves affected with IBK in one beef herd and one dairy\nherd. While Moraxella bovis was isolated in some cases, the majority of\nisolated bacteria were hemolytic Gram-negative cocci. Eighteen such\nisolates had near full-length (1397 bp) 16S rDNA sequences that\nclustered into 3 different groups that had 99.9% identity and which were\nrelated to published rrs sequences of Moraxella bovis and Moraxella\novis. Results of sequence analysis of 6 housekeeping genes, the 16S-23S\nrDNA interspacer region, and partial 23S rDNA provide strong support for\ninclusion of these isolates within the classical Moraxellae as a novel\ntaxon, for which the name Moraxella bovoculi sp. nov. is proposed (type\nstrain: 237T ; =ATCC BAA-1259T = CCUG 52049T).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraxella bovoculi sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2634.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraxella bovoculi sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2632.phy"},{"tree_label":"Amino Acid Tree","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Moraxella bovoculi sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2633.phy"}]}
