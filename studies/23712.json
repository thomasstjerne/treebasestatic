However, no reliable pure cultures have been\nreported in this genus. Here, we report for the first time the\nsuccessful isolation of mycelial strains from basidiospores in the genus\nHydnum. Basidiospores obtained from basidioma samples were aseptically\ninoculated onto modified NorkranÂ’s C (MNC) medium, MNC containing\nn-butyric acid (n-MNC), or MNC with gellan gum instead of agar (G-MNC).\nAlthough basidiospore germination was observed in most samples, the\nisolation rate was higher from MNC (91.7%) and G-MNC (93.8%) than from\nn-MNC (36.4%). Most established isolates were monokaryotic and lacked a\nclamp connection, but three were dikaryotic and had clamp connections.\nEstablished isolates were identified by molecular phylogenetic analysis\nof the internal transcribed spacer region of the rRNA gene. These\nresults suggest that basidiospores can be used to establish monokaryotic\nand dikaryotic isolates of Hydnum species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115256","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115256.phy"}]}
