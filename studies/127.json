Both\napproaches are useful in testing hypotheses of homology among\ntraditional characters but the combination approach is more useful than\nthe consensus approach in testing hypotheses of reticulate evolution.\nThis is because discrete chloroplast DNA markers can be tracked on the\ntopology of alternative cladograms. Such discrete DNA markers are\nderived from a chloroplast DNA phylogeny using the bootstrap resampling\nprocedure; a chloroplast DNA lineage with a 95100% confidence level is\nscored as a discrete character in an integrated data set. The results\nsuggest that Sphinctospermum is related to genera of Robinieae by common\ndescent and that introgressive hybridization has not been involved in\nthe evolution of this morphologically distinctive genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 12","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_618.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_619.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1552.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1553.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1554.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1555.phy"}]}
