Although troodontids have been known for over 150 years,\nfew known derived troodontid specimens preserve significant portions of\nboth the forelimb and the hindlimb. Here, we report a new troodontid\ntaxon, Linhevenator tani gen. et sp. nov., based on a partial,\nsemi-articulated skeleton recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Wulansuhai\nFormation of Wulatehouqi, Inner Mongolia, China. L. tani has an unusual\ncombination of primitive and derived character states, though our\nphylogenetic analysis places it in a derived clade within the\nTroodontidae. As a derived taxon, L. tani has a dromaeosaurid-like pedal\ndigit II, and this species also possesses a humerus that is\nproportionally much shorter and more robust than those of most other\ntroodontids. The combination of features present in Linhevenator\nindicates a complex pattern of character evolution within the\nTroodontidae. In particular, the discovery of Linhevenator suggests that\nderived troodontids have independently evolved a highly specialized\npedal digit II and have significantly shortened the forelimb over the\ncourse of their evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Troodontidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55433.phy"}]}
