Fermentations of 12 other strains of\nNodulisporium also yielded nodulisporic acid. These strains came from a\nvariety of environmental substrata collected from 7 tropical regions in\n4 continents. Cultural characteristics and microscopic features show\nthat the nodulisporic acid-producing Nodulisporium strains are\nmorphologically all the same species. Sequencing of the rDNA region\nconsisting of the two internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S gene\nrevealed that the isolates were distributed into three groups, according\nto the length of the ITS1. The two groups with the longest sequences\nwere not distinguishable, based on nucleotide divergence data and\nparsimony analysis of the common region of ITS1. The group of isolates\nwith shorter sequences showed lower homology with the other groups in\nthe ITS1 region, but those strains could not be clearly\ndistinguished.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NAP alignment","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3818.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypoxylon and Nodulisporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3819.phy"}]}
