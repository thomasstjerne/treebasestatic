Baral\n(Lachnaceae, Helotiales) primarily includes xerotolerant species\ncharacterized by apothecia with long, mostly white, thick-walled hairs\ntipped with apical crystals, ectal excipulum of thick-walled textura\nprismatica, and the presence of yellow to orange lipid bodies in\nhymenial elements (Baral and Matočec, 2005). There are 9 species known\nworldwide, although their phylogenetic context and interrelatedness\nremain poorly understood. Within the genus there are several\nmorphologically distinct species (Lachnum patulum (Pers.: Fr.) Rehm ss.\nFuckel, Capitotricha scabrovillosa (W. Phillips) Baral, comb. ined., C.\ncrystalligera (Sacc.) Järv & Baral, comb. ined., and three new\nspecies reported by Baral and Matočec (2005), as well as a group of\nspecies with similar overall morphological characters (Capitotricha\nbicolor (Bull.: Fr.) Baral, C. fagiseda Baral nom. prov., and C. rubi\n(Bres.) Baral). Among these three species, Capitotricha rubi differs\nfrom the other two by its smaller asci and ascospores, and it was for a\nlong time treated as a variety of C. bicolor. It was elevated to species\nlevel by Baral (in Baral and Krieglsteiner 1985), who at the same time\nproposed that two lineages could be distinguished in Capitotricha\nbicolor on the basis of ascospore measurements  one growing on twigs and\ncupules of Fagus (C. fagiseda), and the other one on twigs of other\nhosts (C. bicolor s.str.). Suková (2005) noted as additional characters\nthe differences in thickness of the excipulum and the relative abundance\nof apical crystals. All these characters are overlapping, however, and\nthere is a clear need for a better understanding of species delimitation\nin this group, especially among the species inhabiting woody\nsubstrates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr105663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_105663.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106458","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106458.phy"}]}
