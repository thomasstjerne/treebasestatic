Phylogenetic analyses of\nHaligena elaterophora (type species) and H. salina were undertaken,\nusing partial large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, to determine their\nrelationships with other closely related genera in the order. The genus\nwas shown to be polyphyletic within the Halosphaeriales, with the type\nspecies forming a basal clade to the order. Haligena salina constituted\na sister group with Neptunella longirostris. Haligena elaterophora and\nH. salina differ significantly in the nature of their ascospore\nappendages: wider, more sticky and strap-like in H. elaterophora , and\nspoon-shaped at the point of attachment, while in H. salina they are\nlonger and narrower, finely drawn out filaments. A new genus,\nMorakotiella, is introduced to accommodate H. salina.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haligena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2062.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Haligena","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2061.phy"}]}
