It is well circumscribed by having\na basidiome with decurrent and distant white gills with evident\npink-lilac tinges at maturity, well developed cheilocystidia, and\nechinulate globose spores. The study includes a description, color\nphotographs of fresh basidiomes and line drawings of relevant\nmicroscopic traits. N. dominicanus is very close to Neopaxillus\nechinospermus, the type species of the genus Neopaxillus. Based on\ncomparative ITS-LSU rDNA gene sequence analyses, Neopaxillus, a genus\nformerly placed in Boletales, is considered within Agaricales and where\nit is sister to Crepidotus (Crepidotaceae).","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Combined ITS and LSU Crepidotoid Baysian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46315.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"LSU Crepidotoid Bayesian Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_46316.phy"}]}
