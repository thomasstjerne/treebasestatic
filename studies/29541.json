Phylogenetic analyses of Dacrymyces\nwere performed by the combined ITS+nLSU dataset, and five specimens were\ngathered into two distinct lineages in the phylogeny. These specimens\nare identified as two new species, D. cerebellum and D. sinostenosporus\nbased on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis.\nDetailed characteristics with morphological photos of two new species\nare provided here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136059","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136059.phy"}]}
