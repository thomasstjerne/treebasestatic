E. senticosus produces a rich variety of saponins such as\noleanane-type, noroleanane-type, 29-hydroxyoleanan-type, and lupane-type\nsaponins. Genomic or transcriptomic approaches have not been used to\ninvestigate the saponin biosynthetic pathway in this plant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of plant CYPs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85430.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of plant UGTs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85431.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of plant OSCs","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_85407.phy"}]}
