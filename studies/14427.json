A recent\nstudy performed in S. colpophylla showed that dioecy and the sex\nchromosomes in this species evolved independently from those in S.\nlatifolia, the most widely studied dioecious Silene species. The results\nof the present study show that the sex-determining system in S. otites,\na species related to S. colpophylla, is based on female heterogamety, a\nsex determination system that is unique among the Silene species studied\nto date. Our phylogenetic data support the placing of S. otites and S.\ncolpophylla in the subsection Otites and the analysis of ancestral\nstates suggests that the most recent common ancestor of S. otites and S.\ncolpophylla was most probably dioecious. A switch from XX/XY sex\ndetermination to a ZZ/ZW system (or vice versa) probably must have\noccurred in the subsection Otites. This is the first report of two\ndifferent types of heterogamety within one plant genus of this mostly\nnon-dioecious plant family.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64589","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64589.phy"}]}
