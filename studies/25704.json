Currently, no molecular studies\nhave been completed to elucidate their relationships with other needle\npathogens. Results of this study indicated two molecularly distinct\nco-occurring species, L. concolor and L. montivaga. Phylogenetic\nanalyses revealed that Lophodermella is polyphyletic. However, all but\ntwo species consistently clustered in a well-supported clade within\nRhytismataceae. The phylogenies also confirmed consistent nesting of\nLophophacidium dooksii with the Lophodermella clade, providing further\nevidence of Lophophacidium dooksii as a Lophodermella taxon within\nRhytismataceae. Potential synapomorphic characters for the Lophodermella\nclade were also explored. This study highlights the importance of\ndeveloping molecular tools for understanding taxonomy and phylogeny of\nneedle pathogens. It further suggests the need for genetic\ncharacterization of other Lophodermella and Lophophacidium species to\nprovide a higher phylogenetic resolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Lophodermella Rhytismataceae Consensus Tree","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121613","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121613.phy"}]}
