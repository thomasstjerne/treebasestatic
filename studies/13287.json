Here we report a new basal avialan, Epidexipteryx\nhui gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle to Late Jurassic of Inner\nMongolia, China. This new species is characterized by an unexpected\ncombination of characters seen in several different theropod groups,\nparticularly the Oviraptorosauria. Phylogenetic analysis shows it to be\nthe sister taxon to Epidendrosaurus, forming a new clade at the base of\nAvialae. Epidexipteryx also possesses two pairs of elongate ribbon-like\ntail feathers, and its limbs lack contour feathers for flight. This\nfinding shows that a member of the avialan lineage experimented with\nintegumentary ornamentation as early as the Middle to Late Jurassic, and\nprovides further evidence relating to this aspect of the transition from\nnon-avian theropods to birds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Avialae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56309.phy"}]}
