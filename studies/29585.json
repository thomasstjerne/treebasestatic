In this study,\nphylogenetic analyses are based on a concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and\nnrLSU sequence data of Stereaceae around the world. Three new genera and\neight new species are presented, and eight new combinations proposed. We\nare provided brief notes for each accepted genus, Acanthostereum,\nConfertotrama and Gelatinostereum, including information on\nclassification, type species and morphological descriptions. The newly\ndescribed species of Acanthostereum brunneum, Acanthostereum effusum,\nAleurodiscus globispora, Aleurodiscus subcerussatus, Conferticium\nsubtropicum, Gelatinostereum phlebioides, Gloeocystidiopsis shenghuai,\nStereum vietnamensis are introduced as novel species to family\nStereaceae. The new combinations Acanthostereum chinensis,\nAcanthostereum wakullum, Confertotrama aspera, Confertotrama macrospora,\nConfertotrama rugulosa, Confertotrama rajchenbergii, Gloeocystidiopsis\nravum and Gloeocystidiopsis tenuissimus are proposed based on morphology\nand phylogenetic analyses. An identification key to all 17 genera of\nStereaceae is presented.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136152","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136152.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136153","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136153.phy"}]}
