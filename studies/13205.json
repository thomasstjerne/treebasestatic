It consists of a partial skull\nroof, four mandible fragments with two teeth in situ, portions of\npostcranial armor (some in situ), skin impressions, articulated\npost-thoracic vertebrae, ten partial thoracic ribs, a partial left\nilium, both ischia, and tail club, and associated right radius, left\nmetacarpal IV, femur, tibia, fibula, and pes. We provide a detailed\nredescription of this material as well as comparisons with other\nankylosaurid specimens referred to E. tutus. The synonymy of the genus\nwith Euoplocephalus is not supported, and Dyoplosaurus is a valid taxon.\nIt is possible that the fragmentary nature of the holotype of\nEuoplocephalus leads to the inference that the diversity of Late\nCretaceous North American ankylosaurids is lower than it actually is. As\nsuch, it might be necessary to look beyond traditional cranial\ncharacters in order to accurately appraise the number and nature of\nvarious ankylosaurid taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ankylosauridae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55906.phy"}]}
