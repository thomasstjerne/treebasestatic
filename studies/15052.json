This corticioid\nfungus is characterized by resupinate basidiomes with smooth to\ntuberculate hymenophore, a monomitic hyphal system with simple-septate\nhyphae, finely echinulate halocystidia, cylindrical to clavate,\ndextrinoid acanthophyses, and globose, hyaline, smooth and thin-walled,\nIKIâ basidiospores. Phylogenetic analyses of a LSU dataset and a\ncombined dataset of ITS and LSU were carried out and the new taxon was\nfound to be related to cyphelloid fungi within the Agaricales.\nDescriptions and drawings of the microscopic features of A.\nbrueggemannii are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"gen.26000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88502","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88502.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.27000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88503","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88503.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.2000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88448","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88448.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.3000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88449","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88449.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.4000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88450","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88450.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.5000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88451","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88451.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.6000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88452","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88452.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.7000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88453","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88453.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.8000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88454.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.1000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88447.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.9000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88455","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88455.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.10000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88456","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88456.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.11000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88457","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88457.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.12000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88458","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88458.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.21000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88497","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88497.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.22000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88498","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88498.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.23000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88499","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88499.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.20000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88496","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88496.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.24000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88500","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88500.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.25000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88501","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88501.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.28000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88504","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88504.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.2120000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88505","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88505.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.19000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88465","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88465.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.20000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88466","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88466.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.21000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88467","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88467.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.22000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88468","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88468.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.23000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88469","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88469.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.24000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88470","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88470.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.25000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88471","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88471.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.26000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88472","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_88472.phy"},{"tree_label":"gen.27000","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr88473","tree_kind":"NA","tre
