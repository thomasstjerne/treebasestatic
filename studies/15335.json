Lectotypes are designated for Bipolaris secalis and\nCurvularia richardiae, and an epitype is designated for Curvularia\ncrustacea. A new monotypic genus, Johnalcornia, is introduced to\naccommodate Bipolaris aberrans, which clusters sister to the newly\ndescribed Porocercospora. Johnalcornia differs morphologically from this\ntaxon by producing distinctive conidia-like chlamydospores as well as\ncomparatively thick-walled, geniculate conidiophores, with conidiogenous\ncells that have conspicuous scars. Johnalcornia further differs from\nrelated genera by forming the second conidial septum in the apical\ncell.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJ","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bipolaris and Curvularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72335.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bipolaris and Curvularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_72334.phy"}]}
