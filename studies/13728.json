Earlier studies have found some\nphylogenetic structure within the genus but also incongruences between\nnuclear and plastid DNA markers. Here we show how the use of a necessary\nlarge taxon sampling in combination with genetic incongruence can\ninfluence even more negatively the reconstruction of phylogenetic\ninference. These problems can be overcome by the exclusion of rogue taxa\nfrom the data set and the subsequent analysis of general molecular\ndifferentiation patterns. Evolution and diversification of Hoya in the\ntropical forests of the IAA region are presented and possible ecological\nand morphological parameters forming the base of biogeographic patterns\nare proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"2p2 (matrix 3)","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74508.phy"},{"tree_label":"2cp tree (matrix 1)","ntax":"170","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74509.phy"},{"tree_label":"2nr (matrix 2)","ntax":"168","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74510.phy"},{"tree_label":"2p2 reduced (matrix 4)","ntax":"129","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74511.phy"},{"tree_label":"8gene","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74512.phy"},{"tree_label":"HDexcluded","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hoya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74513.phy"}]}
