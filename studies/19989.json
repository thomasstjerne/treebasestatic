The former\nis characterized by perennial and sessile basidiocarps, a concentrically\nsulcate and cracked pileal surface, a homogeneous context, small pores\n(79 per mm), a dimitic hyphal system, subglobose, yellowish and\nthick-walled basidiospores 4.35 × 44.5 μm. Macroscopically it resembles\nF. merrillii, which differs in having larger basidiospores (56 × 45 μm).\nF. centroamericanus is similar to F. robiniae in sharing applanate\nbasidiocarps and subglobose, yellowish and thick-walled basidiospores\n3.94.5 × 3.74.2 μm, whereas F. robiniae has larger basidiospores (56 ×\n4.55 μm). In nuclear large subunit rDNA (nLSU) and internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) based phylogenies, the two new species formed two distinct\nlineages in the Fulvifomes clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110626.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110627","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110627.phy"}]}
