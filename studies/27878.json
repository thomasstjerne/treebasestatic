Phylogenetic analyses were based on sequences of the\nnuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and large\nsubunit (nrLSU), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and\ntranslation elongation factor 1- (Tef1) regions. Sequences of the new\ntaxon formed a sister group to Exidia thuretiana, a species known from\nEurope and Asia, and distant to sequences of Exidia repanda from Europe.\nFruiting bodies are cushion-shaped to irregularly lobed and yellowish\nbrown, basidiospores are hyaline, allantoid (averaging 12.7  3.4 m;\nQavg = 3.7), and the host is Betula. The new species also can be\ndistinguished by nrITS, nrLSU, RPB2, and Tef1 sequences. Our multigene\nphylogeny supports an Exidia including Exidia japonica, type species of\nTremellochaete, but defining generic limits in Auriculariaceae will\nrequire more extensive taxon sampling.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129473","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129473.phy"}]}
