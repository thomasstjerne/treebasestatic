Recent phylogenetic studies have\nfound support for a distinctive, geographically diverse group of 24\nspecies referred to as the Lellingeria myosuroides clade and have\nprovided evidence for a variety of phylogenetic relationships within the\ngroup, as well as hypotheses of historical processes that have produced\ncurrent biogeographical patterns. We present new data and analyses that\nsupport the following primary conclusions: 1) the L. myosuroides clade\nis monophyletic and pantropical; 2) that clade is sister to a more\nspecies rich clade of entirely Neotropical species (Lellingeria s.s.);\n3) we infer two independent dispersal events from the Neotropics to\nPacific islands, five independent dispersal events from the Neotropics\nto the Paleotropics, and two separate dispersal events from mainland\ntropical America to the West Indies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"t1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25891","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25891.phy"},{"tree_label":"t2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25892","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25892.phy"},{"tree_label":"t3","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25893.phy"}]}
