Together they comprise\nimmense species richness, but little is known about the fundamental\nprocesses that generate their diversity. Exploration of their population\nstructure is needed, especially with regard to geographic distributions\nand host affiliations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophodermium isolates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_76301.phy"}]}
