Distinctive macro- and micromorphological characters in\ncombination with a phylogenetic analysis based on ITS sequences support\ntheir taxonomic identity and position in each of the above mentioned\ngenera of theOmphalotaceae. Species here described form\nrhizomorphs.Morphological descriptions, including illustrations,\nphotographs, and taxonomic discussions are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"256","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127849","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127849.phy"}]}
