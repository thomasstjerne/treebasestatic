Repeated colonization of a region by closely-related taxa\nmay cause similar effects as species within each lineage compete with\none another. This may be particularly relevant for secondary colonists,\nwhich could experience limited diversification due to competition with\nearlier, already diversified colonists, in other words, the incumbent\ncolonists. This potential mechanism through which ecological opportunity\ncan be limited has been poorly studied in spatially-limited oceanic\nisland systems. We tested the hypothesis that an incumbent lineage may\ndiminish the diversification of secondary colonists in two speciose\nclades of Philippine “Old Endemic” murine rodentsPhloeomyini and\nChrotomyinion the relatively old oceanic island of Luzon. Although\nphylogenetic analyses confirm the independent, non-contemporaneous\ncolonization of Luzon by the ancestors of these two clades, we found no\nsupport for arrested diversification in either, instead inferring that\ntheir diversification resulted from constant-rate processes that were\neither uniform or favoring Chrotomyini, depending on the method used.\nOur results suggest that ecological incumbency has not played an\nimportant role in determining lineage diversification among Luzon\nmurines, despite sympatric occurrence by constituent species within each\nlineage, and a substantial head start for the primary colonists, the\nPhloeomyini.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STATE 800000","ntax":"204","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Murinae Posterior
