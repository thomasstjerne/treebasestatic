The combined phylogenetic analyses of\nmolecular data from nuc rDNA 18S and 28S markers demonstrate that the\nnew taxon is an independent lineage and thus a taxonomically distinct\nunit. It is morphologically characterized by bag-like projections\narising from the bicellular teliospore wall, like those found in\nPuccinia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115778","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115778.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115779.phy"}]}
