During an investigation of the diversity of alkali-tolerant or\nalkalophilic fungi in China, two isolates producing columnar conidial\nheads with globose conidia belonging to Aspergillus are isolated from\nthe soda soil and named as Aspergillus jilinensis. Its phylogenetic\nposition is determined by analysis of a dataset of the combined gene\nfragments including the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) region, beta-tubulin (BenA) gene, and calmodulin (CaM) genes. The\nmorphology and culture characteristics of this fungus are described.\nDistinctions between the new species and its close relatives are\ndiscussed. Aspergillus jilinensis is phylogenetically clustered with A.\nalabamensis, but it differs from the latter by producing smaller and\nfewer conidia. Additionally, colonies of A. jilinensis present light\nbuff-colored on MEA and bright golden yellow color on CYA. Meanwhile,\nthe enzyme activity assays show that α-amylase, endo-protease, and\nendo-β-1, 4-xylanase of A. jilinensis are thermostable in an alkaline\nreaction system, responding to alkali-tolerant characteristics,\nindicating a potential alkali-tolerant enzyme candidate. This study\nupdates our knowledge of species diversity of alkali-tolerant\nAspergillus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122622","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122622.phy"}]}
