Recent studies showed that it is a species complex and\nthree species from North America and one species from Europe were\nrecognized in this complex. In the current study, six new species in\nFomitopsis pinicola complex are discovered from East Asia based on\nmorphological characters and phylogenetic analyses inferred from\nsequences data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, the\nsecond subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) and the translation\nelongation factor 1-Î± gene (TEF). Detailed descriptions of the six new\nspecies are provided. Our results also indicated that species of the F.\npinicola complex from East Asia usually have limited distribution areas\nand host specialization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
