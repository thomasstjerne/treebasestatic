Morphological characters and phylogenetic\nanalyses based on ITS, LSU and TEF1Î± sequence data support their\nplacement in Dictyocheirospora and Dictyosporium (Dictyosporiaceae). An\nupdated backbone tree is provided for the family Dictyosporiaceae.\nDescriptions and illustrations of the new taxa and recollections are\nprovided. Four new combinations are proposed for Dictyocheirospora.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyoporiaceae ITS LSU TEF MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113331.phy"}]}
