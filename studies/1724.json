The causal agent of downy mildew on various plants of\nChenopodiaceae, including spinach, is currently regarded as a single\nspecies, Peronospora farinosa. In the present study, ITS rDNA sequence\nand morphological data demonstrated that P. farinosa from Spinacia\noleracea is distinct from downy mildew of other chenopodiaceous hosts. A\ntotal of 58 specimens of spinach were collected or loaned from 17\ncountries of Asia, Europe, Oceania, North and South America, and all\nspecimens formed a distinct monophyletic group. No intercontinental\ngenetic variation of ITS rDNA was found within Peronospora accessions\ncausing spinach downy mildew disease worldwide. Phylogenetic trees\nsupported recognition of Peronospora from spinach as a separate species.\nIn microscopic examination, Peronospora specimens from Spinacia also\nrevealed morphological differences from P. farinosa specimens from\nAtriplex, Beta, and Chenopodium. Consequently, the name Peronospora\neffusa should be reinstated for the downy mildew fungus on spinach. A\nspecimen among the original collections of Peronospora effuse was\ndesignated as lectotype here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora farinosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_335.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Peronospora farinosa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_571.phy"}]}
