A suite of autapomorphies\nlead us to recognize the specimen as a new taxon. Phylogenetic analysis\nresolves this giant bird deep within Aves as a basal member of\nOrnithuromorpha. This Kazakh fossil demonstrates that large body size\nevolved at least once outside modern birds (Neornithes) and reveals\nhitherto unexpected trophic diversity within Cretaceous Aves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1A","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves Phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55244.phy"}]}
