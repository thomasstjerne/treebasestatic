The aim of this study was to\ninvestigate, using a multi-locus phylogenetic approach, the spectrum of\nspecies of the section Versicolores and to determine their in vitro\nantifungal susceptibility. The study was based on a set of 77 clinical\nisolates from different USA medical centers, which had been previously\nidentified as belonging to this section. The genetic markers used were\nITS, BenA, CaM and RPB2, and the drugs tested, following the CLSI\nguidelines, were amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole,\nvoriconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, terbinafine and\nflucytosine. The most frequent species were A. sydowii (26%), A. creber\n(22%) and A. amoenus (18.2%), followed by A. protuberus (13%), A.\njensenii (10.4%), and A. tabacinus (5.2%); while A. cvjetkovicii, A.\nfructus, A. puulaauensis and A. versicolor were represented by only one\nisolate each (1.3%). This is the first time that A. jensenii and A.\npuulaauensis have been reported from clinical samples. Considering the\nhigh number of isolates identified as belonging to this fungal group in\nthis study, its clinical relevance should not be overlooked. Aspergillus\nversicolor, traditionally considered one of the most common species in\nthis section in a clinical setting, was only rarely recovered in our\nstudy. The in vitro antifungal results showed that echinocandins and\nterbinafine were the most potent drugs, the azoles showed variable\nresults, amphotericin B was poorly active, and 5-fluorocytosine was the\nless active.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Concatenated","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr93428","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93428.phy"},{"tree_label":"RPB2","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93436","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93436.phy"},{"tree_label":"CaM","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr93435","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93435.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93434","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93434.phy"},{"tree_label":"BenA","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93438","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_93438.phy"}]}
