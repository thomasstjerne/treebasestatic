However, key\nassump- 33 tions of barcoding remain untested for many groups of\nsoft-bodied marine invertebrates with poorly 34 resolved taxonomy. Here,\nwe applied an integrative approach for species delimitation to\nherbivorous 35 sea slugs in clade Sacoglossa, in which unrecognized\ndiversity may complicate studies of drug discovery, 36 plastid\nendosymbiosis, and biological control. Using the mitochondrial barcoding\nCOI gene and the 37 nuclear histone 3 gene, we tested the hypothesis\nthat three widely distributed ‘species’ each comprised 38 a complex of\nindependently evolving lineages. Morphological and reproductive\ncharacters were then 39 used to evaluate whether each lineage was\ndistinguishable as a candidate species. The ‘circumtropical’ 40 Elysia\nornata comprised a Caribbean species and four Indo-Pacific candidate\nspecies that are potential 41 sources of kahalalides, anti-cancer\ncompounds. The ‘monotypic’ and highly photosynthetic Plakobran- 42 chus\nocellatus, used for over 60 years to study chloroplast symbiosis,\ncomprised 10 candidate species. 43 Finally, six candidate species were\ndistinguished in the Elysia tomentosa complex, including potential bio-\n44 logical control agents for invasive green algae (Caulerpa spp.). We\nshow that a candidate species approach 45 developed for vertebrates\neffectively categorizes cryptic diversity in marine invertebrates, and\nthat inte- 46 grating threshold COI distances with non-molecular\ncharacter data can delimit species even when com- 47 mon assumptions of\nDNA barcoding are violated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65785.phy"},{"tree_label":"Plakobranchus_CO1_tree","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65786.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65789","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65789.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65790","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65790.phy"},{"tree_label":"Consensus","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr65791","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_65791.phy"}]}
