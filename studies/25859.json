The new\nspecies is classified into the Lecanora subfusca groupallophana subgroup\nand distinguishable from Lecanora imshaugii Brodo by darker thallus,\nbrownish disc, Kinsoluble granules on the surface of epihymenium,\nshorter hypothecium, and the presence of oil droplets in the apothecial\nsection. Molecular analyses employing internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nand mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) sequences strongly support\nLecanora baekdudaeganensis as a distinct species in the genus Lecanora.\nA surrogate key is provided to assist in the identification of all 52\ntaxa in the genus Lecanora of Korea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122376","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122376.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122377","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_122377.phy"}]}
