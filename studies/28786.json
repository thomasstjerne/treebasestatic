During 2017 surveys of Eucalyptus diseases in Sabah,\nMalaysia, typical symptoms of Calonectria leaf blight were observed. A\nlarge number of Calonectria isolates were collected from diseased leaves\nand soils associated with symptomatic trees. The aim of this study was\nto identify and resolve the phylogenetic relationships between these\nisolates using morphological characters and DNA sequence comparisons for\nsix gene regions. From a collection of 73 isolates, eight species\nresiding in three species complexes were identified. Among these, four\nundescribed species were characterized, and are named here as Ca.\nborneana, Ca. ladang, Ca. pseudomalesiana and Ca. tanah. Results of this\nstudy support the view that planted Eucalyptus in tropical and\nsubtropical areas of the world represent niches remarkably rich in\nCalonectria spp. This also has implications for the management of\ndiseases on these important trees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133709","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133709.phy"}]}
