This new\ntaxon is diagnosed by a unique combination of derived features:\nprezygapophysis closely contacts with parapophysis, with the prdl and\nprpl absent; presence of cavity on the dorsal surface of the\ndiapophysis; neural spine very low, with its distal end level with that\nof diapophysis; distal end of the neural spine strongly expanded\nlaterally to form a platform; marked fossa formed between the\ninfradiapophyseal lamina and the parapophysis; broad, flat area of\nfeatureless bone on lateral surface of neural arch; vertically directed\ninfradiapophyseal lamina expands or bifurcates ventrally to form a\ninverted “Y”; highly positioned parapophyses large and tear-drop in\nshape. The discovery of this new taxon increases the diversity of\nsauropods in China during the Early Cretaceous.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Eusauropoda results","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eusauropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55832.phy"}]}
