These five fungi would have been missed by many previous\necological studies because their sequences are not well matched to\navailable taxon-specific primers and four of the five do not stain well\nwith the standard reagents used for morphological analysis. Based upon\nspore morphology, these species are currently assigned to Glomus and\nAcaulospora, and two of the species are dimorphic, exhibiting spore\nstages of both genera. This suggests that dimorphic spores are the\nancestral state for the order and that one or the other morphology was\nlost in various lineages. Our analyses also show that Geosiphon\npyriforme, a symbiont with cyanobacteria that is putatively the nearest\noutgroup, is not necessarily outside the Glomales; instead it may be\nderived from mycorrhizal ancestors.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Glomales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3528.phy"}]}
