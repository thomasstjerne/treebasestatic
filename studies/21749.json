Twenty-two\nColletotrichum strains were isolated from three Dendrobium species D.\ncariniferum, D. catenatum and D. harveyanum, as well as three\nunidentified species. The taxa were identified using morphological\ncharacterisation and phylogenetic analyses of ITS, GAPDH, ACT and\nßtubulin sequence data. This is the first time to identify endophytic\nfungi from Dendrobium orchids using the above method. The known species,\nColletotrichum boninense, C. camelliaejaponicae, C. fructicola, C.\njiangxiense and C. orchidophilum were identified as fungal endophytes of\nDendrobium spp., along with the new species, C. cariniferi, C.\nchiangraiense, C. doitungense, C. parallelophorum and C. watphraense,\nwhich are introduced in this paper. One strain is recorded as an\nunidentified species. Corn meal agar is recommended as a good\nsporulation medium for Colletotrichum species. This is the first report\nof fungal endophytes associated with Dendrobium cariniferum and D.\nharveyanum. Colletotrichum camelliaejaponicae, C. jiangxiense, and C.\norchidophilum are new host records for Thailand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
