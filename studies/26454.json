The\nlatter species is officially reported for the first time outside its\noriginal locality in Martinique, significantly extending the geographic\nrange for this uncommon pinkish-spored bolete. A detailed morphological\ndescription is provided for each species and accompanied by color\npictures of fresh basidiomes in habitat and line drawings of the main\nanatomical features. Both species represent independent lineages within\ntheir respective genera. In order to confirm the accuracy of species\nidentification, their identity and relationships have been molecularly\ninvestigated by generating a multilocus phylogenetic inference based on\nfour gene markers (ITS, 28S rDNA, RPB2, TEF1-Î±) and by comparing the\noutcomes with the genetic material already available in public\ndatabases. Austroboletus subflavidus is a widely distributed species in\nNorth and Central America, whereas F. gloeocarpa is apparently highly\nlocalized and seems to appear sparingly in the Dominican Republic.\nComparisons with morphologically similar and molecularly allied species\nare also presented and discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Boletales LSU ITS rpb2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128193.phy"}]}
