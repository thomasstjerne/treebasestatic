In this study, two\nstrains of Botryosphaeriaceae were isolated from soil attached to a\nmacrofungal stipe collected from Anuppur (Amarkantak), Madhya Pradesh,\nIndia. These were characterized and identified both by morphological and\nDNA sequence data of multi locus sequence analysis (MLSA) including 5\nregions viz., small subunit, internal transcribed spacer, large subunit,\nbeta-tubulin, translation elongation factor regions. Based on the\npresent study, a new anamorphic genus Allanobotryosphaeria is proposed,\ncharacterized by fast growing dark green- black colony, long\nmultilocular-pipillate black conidiomata with separate ostiole and small\n≥2µm cylindrical, hyaline conidia. Its teleomorph was not observed. It\nis morphologically distinct from other anamorphic genera of\nBotryosphaeriaceae. According to analysis of sequence data,\nAllanobotryosphaeria indica is phylogenetically distinct from other\ngenera of Botryosphaeriaceae and hence proposed as a new genus et\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Allanobotryosphaeria 14216","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63713.phy"}]}
