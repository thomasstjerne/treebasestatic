Plinthogalus have latex often\nchanging to reddish. Yellowing latex is relatively rare. Lactarius\nmirus, a species with white latex instantly changing to bright yellow\nwas found from fagaceous forests in central-southern China. This is the\nfirst report of species with yellowing latex in L. subg. Plinthogalus in\nChina. Together with the unique latex, the brown pileus, distant\nlamellae and big globose spores with high winged ornamentation\ndistinguish it from all other known species and we described it as a new\nspecies here. DNA barcode nrITS-LSU region and morphological description\nand illustrations are provided. Morphological differences between L.\nmirus and the other species with yellowing latex, e.g.Â Malaysian L.\nflavorosescens and L. pallidior are discussed. The finding of this\nspecies adds new evidence showing the affinity between subtropical China\nand the tropics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129256","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129256.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129257","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129257.phy"}]}
