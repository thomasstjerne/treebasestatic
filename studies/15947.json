Phylogenetic analysis of the new\nspecies and related taxa based on large subunit of nuclear ribosomal DNA\n(nrLSU) sequences is provided. Morphological and molecular data show\nthat the new species should be placed in genus Aureoboletus, and it is\nclearly different from any known taxon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75494","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75494.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75493","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75493.phy"}]}
