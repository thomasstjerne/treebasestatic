Phylogenetic analysis showed this mushroom species formed\nan independent monophyletic lineage within Gomphales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134260","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134260.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134261","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134261.phy"}]}
