Phylogenetic estimations were performed with\nmaximum parsimony and maximum likelihood optimality criteria. In the\nmost parsimonious and most likely reconstructions, the Bacidiaceae sensu\nHafellner 1988 forms a monophyletic group and the Lecanoraceae sensu\nHafellner a paraphyletic group. The genera Tephromela and Scoliciosporum\nappear to belong outside these families. A Kishino-Hasegawa test\nindicated that a phylogeny where the Bacidiaceae and Lecanoraceae,\nexcluding Tephromela and Scoliciosporum, are both monophyletic cannot be\nrejected. Three hypotheses were rejected, viz. (1) that the Lecanoraceae\nand Bacidiaceae together form a monophyletic group, (2) that both the\nLecanoraceae (incl. Scoliciosporum) and Bacidiaceae (incl. Tephromela)\nare monophyletic, and (3) that the ascus apex anatomy reflects\nphylogeny. The suborder Lecanorineae is paraphyletic unless the\nStereocaulaceae and Cladoniaceae are included. One or both of the\nBacidia- and Lecanora-types of ascus have probably evolved at least\ntwice.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1A","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanorales, MPE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3419.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lecanorales, MLE","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3420.phy"}]}
