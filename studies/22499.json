Its multi-loculate-like\nascomata arrangement is similar to species of Lecideopsella\n(Schizothyriaceae), but ascomata lack a network-like arrangement. The\nnew genus also has ascospores with appendages at the both ends. Maximum\nparsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses of a\ncombined ITS and partial LSU sequence dataset revealed that this new\ntaxon is a member of the family Phaeothecoidiellaceae, but it is\ndistinct from any other genera. Therefore, Translucidithyrium\nthailandicum gen. et sp. nov., is introduced here with descriptions and\nillustrations. The discovery of this new genus with sexual characters in\nCapnodiales will make contributions to the further understanding of\nsooty blotch and flyspeck fungal group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110759.phy"}]}
