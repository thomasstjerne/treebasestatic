Using other forms of data, several green coccoid genera have\nbeen shown to be non-monophyletic in the past. Using phylogenetic\nanalysis of rbcL and 18S rDNA sequence data, this study demonstrates\nthat Dictyococcus schumacherensis Metting is related to species in the\ngenus Bracteacoccus Tereg. This placement is consistent with the species\necology and vegetative morphology. Consequently, we propose a new\ncombination, Bracteacoccus schumacherensis (based on Dictyococcus\nschumacherensis), and emend the species description with an altered\ninterpretation of chloroplast features. The genus Dictyococcus, based on\nits type species, D. varians Gerneck, remains a distinct taxon, but its\nexact placement in Chlorophyceae remains unresolved by 18S and rbcL\ndata. The previously expected sister relationship of Dictyococcus with\nBracteacoccus is not supported by this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyococcus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6710.phy"}]}
