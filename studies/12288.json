Wild potatoes (Solanum\nsection Petota) are a highly diverse and economically important group of\nabout 100 species widely distributed throughout the Americas. Thirty-six\npercent of the species in section Petota are polyploid or with diploid\nand polyploid cytotypes. However, the group is poorly understood at the\ngenomic level and the series is ideal to study polyploid evolution. Two\nseparate studies using the nuclear orthologs GBSSI and nitrate reductase\nconfirmed prior hypotheses of polyploid origins in potato and have shown\nnew origins not proposed before. These studies have been limited,\nhowever, by the use of few accessions per polyploid species and by low\ntaxonomic resolution, providing clade-specific, but not species-specific\norigins within clades. The purpose of the present study is to use six\nnuclear orthologs, within 54 accessions of 11 polyploid species, 34\naccessions of 29diploid species of section Petota representing their\nputative progenitors, and two outgroups, to see if phenomena typical of\nother polyploid groups occur within wild potatoes, to include multiple\norigins, loss of alleles, or gain of new alleles.","trees":[{"tree_label":"At5g14320","ntax":"176","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At5g14320_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50532.phy"},{"tree_label":"At5g47390","ntax":"172","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At5g47390_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50534.phy"},{"tree_label":"At1g32130","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At1g32130_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50535.phy"},{"tree_label":"At1g13380","ntax":"182","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At1g13380_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50529.phy"},{"tree_label":"At1g20050","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At1g20050_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50530.phy"},{"tree_label":"At4g10050","ntax":"171","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum section Petota COSII_At4g10050_best_tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50531.phy"}]}
