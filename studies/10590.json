Nectria\neustromatica is characterized by sphaeroid perithecia immersed in\npseudoparenchymatous stromata formed singly or collectively on a\nsubiculum. Despite its deviating teleomorph morphology, it is placed\nwithin Nectria sensu stricto in phylogenetic analyses of a combined\ndataset of LSU, ITS, rpb2 and tef1 sequences with high internal support.\nNectria eustromatica has been collected specifically on Hippocrepis\n(Coronilla) emerus in southern Europe. The anamorph of N. eustromatica\nshares morphological traits with the genera Stilbella and Tubercularia\nbut produces non-phialidic macroconidia in addition to\nphialoconidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nectria eustromatica sp. nov","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20705.phy"}]}
