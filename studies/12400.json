This species can be\ndistinguished phenotypically from the other Phaseolus/Vigna BRR and\nsoybean sudden-death syndrome (SDS) pathogens by the production of wider\nand longer 4-septate conidia cultured on SNA. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyzes of four anonymous intergenic loci, a portion of the translation\nelongation factor (EF-1α) gene and the nuclear ribosomal intergenic\nspacer region (IGS rDNA) strongly support the genealogical exclusivity\nof F. azukicola with respect to the other soybean SDS and BRR pathogens\nwithin Clade 2 of the F. solani species complex (FSSC). Evolutionary\nrelationships of F. azukicola to other members of the SDSBRR clade,\nhowever, are unresolved by phylogenetic analyses of the individual and\ncombined datasets, with the exception of the IGS rDNA partition, which\nstrongly supports it as a sister to the soybean SDS pathogen F.\nbrasiliense. A previously published multilocus genotyping assay is\nupdated to include primer probes that successfully distinguish F.\nazukicola from the other soybean SDS and BRR pathogens. Results of a\npathogenicity experiment reveal that the F. azukicola isolates are able\nto induce root-rot symptoms on azuki bean, mung bean (Vigna radiata),\nkidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and soybean (Glycine max), as well as\ntypical SDS foliar symptoms on soybean. Our hypothesis is that F.\nazukicola evolved in South America and was introduced to Hokkaido,\nJapan, on azuki bean, but its possible route of introduction remains\nunknown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"EF1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51055.phy"},{"tree_label":"5 genes","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51054.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 81","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51059.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 44","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51058.phy"},{"tree_label":"IGS rDNA","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51056.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 96","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51060.phy"},{"tree_label":"Locus 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium azukicola sp. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51057.phy"}]}
