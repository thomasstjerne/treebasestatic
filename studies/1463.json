Owing to\ndiversity in nectary positions and structures, they are thought to have\noriginated multiple times during angiosperm evolution, with their\npotential contribution to the diversification of flowering plants and\npollinating animals being considerable. We investigated the genetic\nbasis of diverse nectary forms in eudicot angiosperm species using CRABS\nCLAW (CRC), a gene required for nectaries in Arabidopsis. CRC expression\nis conserved in morphologically different nectaries from several core\neudicot species and is required for nectary development in both rosids\nand asterids, two major phylogenetic lineages of eudicots. However, in a\nbasal eudicot species, no evidence of CRC expression in nectaries was\nfound. Considering the phylogenetic distribution of nectary positions\nand CRC expression analyses in eudicots, we propose that diverse\nnectaries in core eudicots share conserved CRC gene regulation, and that\nderived nectary positions in eudicots have altered regulation of CRC. As\nthe ancestral function of CRC lies in the regulation of carpel\ndevelopment, it may have been co-opted as a regulator of nectary\ndevelopment within the eudicots, concomitant with the association of\nnectaries with reproductive organs in derived lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"YABBY","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2353.phy"}]}
