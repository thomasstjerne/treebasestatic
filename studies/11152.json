We use a bromeliad\nphylogeny based on eight plastid regions to analyze relationships within\nthe family, test a new, eight-subfamily classification, infer the\nchronology of bromeliad evolution and invasion of different regions, and\nprovide the basis for future analyses of trait evolution and rates of\ndiversification. Methods: We used maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood,\nand Bayesian approaches to analyze 9341 aligned bases for four outgroups\nand 90 bromeliad species representing 46 of 58 described genera. We\ncalibrated the resulting phylogeny against time using penalized\nlikelihood applied to a monocot-wide tree based on plastid ndhF\nsequences, and used it to analyze patterns of geographic spread using\nparsimony, Bayesian inference, and S-DIVA. Results: Bromeliad\nsubfamilies are related to each in ladder-like fashion:\n(Brocchinioideae, (Lindmanioideae, (Tillandsioideae, (Hechtioideae,\n(Navioideae, (Pitcairnioideae, (Puyoideae, Bromelioideae)))))))).\nBromeliads arose in the Guayana Shield 100 Mya, spread centrifugally in\nthe New World beginning 16-13 Mya, and dispersed to West Africa 9.3 Mya.\nModern lineages began to diverge from each other 19 Mya. Conclusions:\nNearly two-thirds of extant bromeliads belong to two large radiations:\nthe higher tillandsioids, originating in the Andes 14.2 Mya, and the\nhigher bromelioids, originating in the Serro do Mar and adjacent regions\n9.1 Mya.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Max Likelihood","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_27337.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRuleBayesian","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_27338.phy"}]}
