Species have also been isolated from\nleaf spots and black spots of fruits. Herein, we introduce a new\nspecies, Phyllosticta rhizophorae isolated from spotted leaves of\nRhizophora stylosa in mangrove forests of Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on combined sequence data of ITS, LSU, EF1α, ACT and GAPDH loci\ncoupled with morphological evidence support the establishment of the new\nspecies. We synonymize P. capitalensis (CPC 20508 and CPC20509) under\nthe new species, Phyllosticta conjac (MUCC0410) under P. capitalensis\nand six strains (CBS 173.77, CBS 119720, CPC 17748, CPC 20252, CPC\n20269, and CBS 123404) are unnamed species based on phylogenetic\nanalyses and nucleotide polymorphisms. The phylogenetic relationships of\nPhyllosticta species are reappraised and suggestions are given for\nfuture work.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr124447","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124447.phy"}]}
