This tri-trophic\nphylogenetic comparison provides no evidence for cospeciation, but\nparasitoids do show phylogenetic conservation of the use of plant\ngenera. Patterns of sequence divergence also suggest that the\nparasitoids radiated more recently (or evolved much faster) than their\ninsect hosts. Three main categories of brood production occur in\nparasitoids: 1) solitary offspring, 2) mixed sex broods, and 3) separate\n(split) sex broods. Split sex broods are very rare and virtually\nrestricted to Achrysocharoides, while the other types occur very widely.\nOur phylogeny suggests that split sex broods have evolved twice and\nprovides evidence for a transition from solitary to mixed sex broods,\nvia split sex broods, as predicted by theory.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Achrysocharoides parasitoid wasps","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2087.phy"}]}
