The resulting\nsupertree contains all the 8 known sphynid species and represents the\nbest estimate of combined relationships presented in the original five\nsource trees. The supertree will provide a useful framework for\nphylogenetic comparative studies of sphyrnid evolution, ecology, and\nbiogeography.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hammerhead Sharks","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_917.phy"}]}
