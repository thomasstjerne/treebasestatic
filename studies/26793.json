A total of 11 phylogenetic\nspecies were identified among 41 isolates based on sequences of EF-1α.\nThese are members of the three species complexes (SC) F. fujikuroi\n(FFSC, n=24), F. incarnatum-equiseti (FIESC, n=13) and F. chlamydosporum\n(FCSC, n=5), which encompass known plant pathogens, mycotoxigenic\nspecies, but also endophytes. Two new phylogenetic species were\nconfirmed by a combined dataset (EF-1α, RPB2 and TUB) and described here\nas F. caapiises and F. brachiariae. The new species are inserted in the\nAfrican clade of the FFSC and morphologically similar to F. mundagurra\nand F. nygamai. Another one singleton represent new phylogenetic lineage\nin the FIESC. This survey contributes to the knowledge of endophyte\nFusarium species associated with wild grasses in Brazil. Furthermore,\nour results show that natural ecosystems reveal high diversity of\nFusarium and may be source of novel species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium brachiaria tef FFSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128397.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium brachiaria tef FIESC FCSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128400.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium brachiaria rpb2 FFSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128399.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium brachiaria tub FFSC","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128398.phy"}]}
