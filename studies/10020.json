Botryosphaeriaceous taxa\nhave been isolated as endophytes and canker pathogens from numerous\nhosts in many parts of the world and have been implicated in the decline\nof E. gomphocephala. In the present study, endophytic fungi were\nisolated from a wide variety of native woody plant species (Acacia\ncochlearis, A. rostellifera, Allocasuarina fraseriana, Agonis flexuosa,\nBanksia grandis, E. gomphocephala, E. marginata and Santalum\nacuminatum), at two locations in native tuart woodland; a site in\ndecline at Yalgorup National Park and a healthy site at Woodman Point\nRegional Park. Of the 226 isolates obtained, 154 were\nbotryosphaeriaceous taxa, 80% of which were Neofusicoccum australe,\nisolated from all hosts at both collection sites. Four new species are\ndescribed; Dothiorella moneti sp. nov, Dothiorella santali sp. nov,\nNeofusicoccum pennatisporum sp. nov and a species belonging to a genus\nonly recently included in the Botryosphaeriaceae, Aplosporella\nyalgorensis sp.nov. The other species isolated were Botryosphaeria\ndothidea on the new hosts A. rostellifera, A. cochlearis and E.\nmarginata and Dichomera eucalypti, on the new host E. marginata. None of\nthe new species formed lesions on excised stems of their host species,\nE. gomphocephala or a common plantation species E. globulus. However,\nNeofusicoccum australe formed lesions on excised stems of E. globulus.\nand E. gomphocephala","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6332.phy"},{"tree_label":"BT","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6647.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU bayes","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6201.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS EF COMB bs","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6237.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6236.phy"},{"tree_label":"LSU BS","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6331.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS EF COMB bayes","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Botryosphaeriaceae from tuart","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6359.phy"}]}
