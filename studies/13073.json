The difference between these two orders is\nvery deep in small-subunit ribosomal gene (SSU) phylogenies. To\nelucidate the real systematic affiliation of K.fimicola we took 4\nsamples from herbarium of Komarov Botanical Institute (LE) to obtain 3\npartial and 1 whole sequences of SSU rDNA. We compared the sequence with\nrepresentatives of Myxomycetes and the reconstructed dendrogramm clearly\nshowed the relationship of K.fimicola to the order Physarales with a\nhigh bootstrep. Though it is impossible to affiliate K.fimicola neither\nin Didymiaceae nor in Physaraceae as it places straight in between two\nfamilies. These data along with morphological observations allow to\nexclude K.fimicola from the order Liceales and define its place among\nPhysarales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dark Spored Clade SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55515.phy"},{"tree_label":"PhysaralesOnly_SSU","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Physarales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55349.phy"}]}
