It is\ncharacterised by the fairly dark brown cap and gills contrast with the\nwhite stem. The major distinctive features are the refracting,\ncolourless granules in the epicutis hyphae, broadly ellipsoid, equally\nverrucose spores, and fruitbody without bluish tints. Cortinarius\nleiocastaneus can be fairly easily recognised by the appearance of\nminiature brown Telamonia species, narrowly amygdaloid spores, and a\nhabitat with Betula. Detailed descriptions of the species are provided\nas well as comparisons to macro- and microscopically similar existing\ntelamonioid taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus were\nstudied by use of ITS rDNA sequence data. Ten new ITS sequences are\npublished. Cortinarius brunneifolius and C. leiocastaneus are fairly\nclosely related and belong to the subgenus Telamonia sensu stricto. The\ninfrasubgeneric relationships were not well resolved, but the new\nspecies seem to be unrelated to the macroscopically similar species and\ndo not clearly belong to any of the existing sections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cortinarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5419.phy"}]}
