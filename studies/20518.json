A severe decline of elm trees has recently been observed in some\nareas of Kerman and Shiraz cities (Iran). However, the identity of the\ncausal agents has not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study,\ncarried out in the years 2012Â–2014 was to determine which fungal trunk\npathogens associated with decline symptoms observed in elm trees.\nSamples were collected from trunk and branches of trees showing disease\nsymptoms and internal wood lesions. Fungal isolations were made from\ndiscolored or decayed wood tissue onto 2% malt extract agar (MEA). In\nKerman some elm trees were attacked by Aeolesthes sarta, therefore\nsamples were also collected from larvae and adult of beetles associated\nwith trees showing wood damage. The fungi associated with symptomatic\ntrees were identified by morphological, cultural and molecular\ncharacteristics. Thirteen fungal species include of Phaeoacremonium (P.)\nminimum, P. parasiticum, P. sicilianum, P. alvesii, P.\nfraxinopennsylvanicum, Spencermartinsia viticola, Dothiorella\nsarmentorum, Neoscytalidium hyalinum, Diatrype whitmanensis, Cosmospora\nviridescens, Phoma herbarum, Phellinus tuberculosus and Inonotus levis\nwere identified. Phaeoacremonium parasiticum was the only species\nisolated from both larvae and adult beetles. Pathogenicity tests were\nperformed on detached shoots of elm under greenhouse conditions.\nDothiorella sarmentorum was the most virulent species based on the\nlength of wood necrosis. This study is the first report of P.\nsicilianum, C. viridescens and P. tuberculosus in Iran. In addition,\nmost of the isolated species are reported for the first time on elm\ntrees in the world.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
