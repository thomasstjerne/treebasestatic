These groups have\nbeen considered monophyletic, although their origins and age have been\nhistorically debated. Recently, Milinkovitch et al. (1993, 1994)\nreported a revised phylogeny for Cetacea, based upon phylogenetic\nanalysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that challenges the classical\nassumption of odontocete monophyly. Their phylogenetic hypotheses were\nbased initially on two mitochondrial ribosomal gene segments (930 base\npairs [bp] from the 12S and 16S genes) from 16 species of cetaceans, an\nartiodactyl, and 2 more distantly related outgroup taxa (Milinkovitch et\nal., 1993), and then from an expanded data set of the ribosomal\nsequences plus a segment of cytochrome b (for a total of 1,352 bp) from\n21 cetaceans and 3 artiodactyls (Milinkovitch et al., 1994). In these\nrevised phylogenies, Physeteroidea (the sperm whales) were placed as a\nsister group to Mysticeti, indicating that Physeteroidea are more\nclosely related to Mysticeti than to the other Odontoceti, and inferring\nparaphyly of the odontocetes. The authors have strongly promoted this\nhypothesis (Milinkovitch et al., 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996) to the extent\nof suggesting a complete reinterpretation of cetacean morphological\nevolution (Milinkovitch, 1995).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetaceans and Artiodactyls","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6977.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetaceans and Artiodactyls","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6974.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetaceans and Artiodactyls","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6976.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1b","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cetaceans and Artiodactyls","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_6975.phy"}]}
