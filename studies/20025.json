This species is clearly different from previously reported\nArmillaria species in North, Central, and South America. It is\ncharacterized by the absence of fibulae in the basidioma; abundant\ncheilocystidia; hyaline, apparently smooth at the light microscope\nlevel, but surface appears slightly to moderately rugulose at the\nscanning electron microscope level; it is differentiated from other\npreviously described Armillaria species by morphological characters,\nincluding annulus structure, pileus and stipe coloration, and other\nstructures. DNA-sequence data [Internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 with\n5.8S, Large subunit (LSU) D-domain, 3’ end of LSU-Intergenic spacer 1,\nand translation elongation factor 1α (tef1α)] show that A. mexicana\nsequences are quite distinct from sequences of analogous Armillaria\nspecies available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis based on tef1α\nsequences place A. mexicana in a well-separated, monophyletic clade that\nappears basal to the polyphyletic Armillaria mellea complex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98926","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98926.phy"}]}
