Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences supported\nprevious reports that the Herpotrichiellaceae (Capronia, black yeasts,\netc.) are distant from Dothideales and Pleosporales. A new sequence of\nCeramothyrium linnaeae, representing the family Chaetothyriaceae, is\nmonophyletic with representatives of the Herpotrichiellaceae, suggesting\nthat both families can be accommodated in the order Chaetothyriales. The\nconcept of Chaetothyriales can not be based on the presence of\nperiphysoids, since Coccodinium bartschii, which also has periphysoids,\nclustered with members of the Dothideaceae. The Chaetothyriales are not\nclosely related to other bitunicates, but are the sister group of either\nEurotiales or Lecanorales/ Peltigerales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1424.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1425.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1426.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ascomycota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1427.phy"}]}
