A\ndisease syndrome characterised by leaf necrosis, stem girdling and\ncutting dieback in eucalyptus and associated with Pestalotiopsis-like\nfungi has been detected in nurseries and young plantations in the last\nyears. Twenty-seven isolates were recovered from diseased seedlings in\nnurseries and from young plants in the field. Phylogenetic analysis\nbased on internal transcribed spacers, partial translation elongation\nfactor 1-α gene and partial β-tubulin gene sequence data grouped the\nisolates in five separate clades. Combining morphological, cultural, and\nmolecular data, five new species of Neopestalotiopsis are described,\nnamely, Neopestalotiopsis eucalyptorum, Neopestalotiopsis hispanica,\nNeopestalotiopsis iberica, Neopestalotiopsis longiappendiculata and\nNeopestalotiopsis lusitanica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131565.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131566","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131566.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr131567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_131567.phy"}]}
