Microsorum × tohieaense can be distinguished from\nother French Polynesian Microsorum by the combination of sori\ndistributed more or less in a single line between the costae and margins\nand sweet smell. Genetic evidence is also presented for the first time\nsupporting the hybrid origin of Microsorum × maximum (Microsorum grossum\n× Microsorum punctatum), and possibly indicating a hybrid origin of\nHawaiian endemic Microsorum spectrum. The implications of hybridization\nfor the taxonomy of microsoroid ferns is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"microsorum plastid tree","ntax":"149","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103637","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103637.phy"},{"tree_label":"microsorum gapCp short tree","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103957","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103957.phy"},{"tree_label":"microsorum gapCp long tree","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103956","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103956.phy"}]}
