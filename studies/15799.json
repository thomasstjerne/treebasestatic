The present work was undertaken to revisit regions\nhistorically known to have a diversity of Batrachospermales. Overall,\nnine taxa were identified from 22 streams. Nine specimens representing\nsix species were collected from eight streams near Rennes. From the Dax\nregion, 16 specimens of six species were collected from 12 streams. Two\nstreams were sampled near Vernon yielding two species. The rbcL gene was\nsequenced for all specimens and phylogenetically analyzed. Sequence data\nrevealed that the Batrachospermales were broadly represented by the nine\ntaxa collected. For most taxa, sequence data are available from other\nparts of the world, but these are the first for Batrachospermum\nvogesiacum. Although there have been changes in land use and habitat,\nmany taxa documented by the pre 20th century French naturalists are\nstill present in the flora today.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"75","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"France Survey of Freshwater Red Algae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_75057.phy"}]}
