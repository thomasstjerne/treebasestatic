Morphologically, its brown to reddish\nbrown hymenophore is very distinctive, which is strongly radially porous\neven lamellate with lower intervenose to anastomosing veins. The\narrestive hymenophore, combined with the yellowish white flesh\ndiscoloring to light yellow when bruised and spore size of 7â“8 Ã\n(3â“)3.5â“4 Î¼m, can easily differs the new species from all known\nChalciporus taxa.
