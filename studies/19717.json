Phylogenetic analyses using\npartial sequences of the small and large subunits as well as the\ncomplete ITS region suggest that strains representing three Endocalyx\nspecies, E. cinctus, E. indumentum and E. melanoxanthus, the latter\nincluding two varieties (E. melanoxanthus var. melanoxanthus and E.\nmelanoxanthus var. grossus) belong to the order Xylariales\n(Sordariomycetes) where they form a strongly supported monophyletic\nlineage within the family Cainiaceae. Species status is proposed for E.\nmelanoxanthus var. grossus under the name E. grossus comb. et stat. nov.\nbased on distinct morphological, cultural, ecological and molecular\nevidence. The generic type species, E. thwaitesii, was not included in\nthe analyses since molecular data or cultures are not available yet and\ntherefore the genus status still requires further refinement. The\nputative placement of Endocalyx within the family Apiosporaceae\n(Xylariales), based on the presence of basauxic conidiogenesis, is\ntentatively rejected as these species clustered within a different\nfamily although within the same order. This mode of conidiogenesis is\ndetermined to have evolved independently within unrelated or distant\nascomycetous lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98399","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98399.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98396","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98403","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98403.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98401","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98401.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98400","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98400.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98402","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98402.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98398","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98398.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr98397","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_98397.phy"}]}
