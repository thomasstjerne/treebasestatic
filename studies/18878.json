This\nspecies, collected in Kerman province, Iran, is well characterized by\nits conidial morphology and rDNA ITS sequences clearly different from\nallied species. Conidia are broadly ellipsoid to subcylindrical,\ni.e. and they are not clavate-spathuliform as in most Phylactinia\nspecies. The rDNA ITS sequence analysis showed that this species is\nclosest to other species described on hosts belonging to Rosaceae such\nas Ph. mail and Ph. pyri-serotinae, but the overall genetic similarity\nof data based on this marker ranged between 92 and 94% in BLASTN search,\ni.e. below percentages suggesting that different species are involved.\nThe new species is described in detail, illustrated and compared with\ngenetically and allied and morphologically similar taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 10 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93866","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 8 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93864","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93864.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 9 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93865","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93853","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93853.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93851","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93851.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 1 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93857","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93857.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 2 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93858.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 4 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93860","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93860.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 5 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93861","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93861.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 7 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93863","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93863.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93852","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93852.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93854","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93854.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 5","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93855","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93855.phy"},{"tree_label":"Single Linkage tree 6","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93856","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93856.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 3 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93859.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 6 from search (criterion: minimize Tree value\nusing character matrix)","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93862","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93862.phy"}]}
