We place D. azureus Hoogmoed, 1969 as its junior synonym, and\nsuspect that D. machadoi Bokermann, 1958 has to be treated in the same\nway. Dendrobates tinctorius exhibits numerous variants differing in\ncolor and pattern.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dendrobates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2572.phy"}]}
