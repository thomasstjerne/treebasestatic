The partial SSU and LSU of nu-rDNA of three coelomycete genera\n(Chaetospermum, Giulia, Mycotribulus) were sequenced to determine their\nphylogenetic relationship. M. mirabilis was well placed in the\nPhysalacriaceae, Agaricales, whereas G. tenuis clusters with the\nCorticiaceae, Corticiales. C. camelliae and C. artocarpi form a close\nrelationship with the Sebacinaceae, Sebacinales. Although\nmorphologically these coelomycetes are pycnidial and with appendaged\nconidia, they show no consistency in their phylogenetic relationship,\nbelonging to disparate major taxonomic groups with putative teleomorphs\nin the Agaricales, Corticiales and Sebacinales. Further molecular\nstudies of coelomycetes may be rewarding to evaluate their phylogenetic\naffinities.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota, SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5113.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1-1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota, SSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5114.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2-1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Basidiomycota, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5116.phy"}]}
