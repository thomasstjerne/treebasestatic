The taxonomy of cultivated potatoes is particularly\ncontroversial. By using DNA sequence data of the waxy gene, we here\ninfer relationships among the four species of cultivated potatoes\naccepted in the latest taxonomic treatment (S. ajanhuiri, S. curtilobum,\nS. juzepczukii and S. tuberosum, the latter divided into the Andigenum\nand Chilotanum Cultivar Groups). The data support prior ideas of hybrid\norigins of S. ajanhuiri from the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (2x = S.\nstenotomum) × S. megistacrolobum; S. juzepczukii from the S. tuberosum\nAndigenum Group (2x = S. stenotomum) × S. acaule; and S. curtilobum from\nthe S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (4x = S. tuberosum subsp. andigenum) ×\nS. juzepczukii. For the tetraploid cultivar-groups of S. tuberosum,\nhybrid origins are suggested entirely within much more closely related\nspecies, except for two of three examined accessions of the S. tuberosum\nChilotanum Group that appear to have hybridized with the wild species S.\nmaglia. Hybrid origins of the crop/weed species S. sucrense are more\ndifficult to support and S. vernei is not supported as a wild species\nprogenitor of the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hybrid origins of polyploid cultivated potatoes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9879.phy"}]}
