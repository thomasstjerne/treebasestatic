This ambiguity raises questions about the biology, as well\nas the evolutionary relationships of this critically important pathogen.\nThus, six genomic regions (LSU rRNA, mtSSU, MCM7, EF-1Î±, Act and ITS)\nwere used for reconstructing its molecular phylogeny based on material\ncollected throughout Brazil. The analyses support the classification of\nthe fungus in the family Mycosphaerellaceae s. str. (Capnodiales,\nDothideomycetes), closely related to Mycosphaerella-like species. The\nâFusicladiumâ-like asexual morph is better accommodated in\nPseudocercospora s. str., and this is now designated as the holomorph\ngenus. Based on these findings, the life cycle of the pathogen was\nrevisited. We propose a model sexual cycle beginning with\nâAposphaeriaâ-like spermogonia in the near mature leaf stage leading to\nascospores produced in pseudothecia within pronounced, erumpent\nascostromata of the Mycosphaerella-type.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr64144","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_64144.phy"}]}
