Molecular phylogenetic analyses were based on a\ncombined dataset of the Small Subunit, the Internal transcribed Spacer\nand the Large Subunit regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA, and the\nmitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 3. The recovered phylogenetic\nhypothesis indicated that U. tepperianum sensu stricto occurs on ‘A.\nbivenosa group’ host species, which was supported by morphological data.\nA provisional epitype of U. tepperianum on A. ligulata is designated to\ncreate a stable taxonomy for the application of this widespread rust\nspecies. Fourteen new provisional species of Uromycladium are described\nfrom the U. tepperianum species complex based on host preference,\nmorphology and phylogenetic concordance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr90386","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_90386.phy"}]}
