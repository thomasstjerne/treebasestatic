An unique\nskull morphology of females suggest affinities with the broad-headed\neleutherodactylines of Northwestern South America in the genus\nStrabomantis. Male and juvenile morphology nonetheless suggest S.\naramunha could be related to members of the recently described genus\nHaddadus from eastern Brazil. We access the affinities of S. aramunha\nusing molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial (12S, tRNAval,\n16S, cyt b) and nuclear sequences (RAG-1and rhodopsin). Bayesian\ninference, likelihood, and parsimony analysis recover a highly supported\nclade with S. aramunha and H. binotatus as sister taxa. Accordingly, we\ntransfer S. aramunha to Haddadus, and provide a new generic definition\nfor the later. The distribution of species in Haddadus (highlands of the\nEspinhaÃ§o mountain Range and coastal eastern Brazil) is now concordant\nwith the general pattern observed for other species in the area.","trees":[{"tree_label":"species rich aramunha.con","ntax":"322","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Terrarana, species rich aramunha","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_67602.phy"},{"tree_label":"gene rich aramunha","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Terrarana, gene rich aramunha, gene rich aramunha","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_67601.phy"}]}
