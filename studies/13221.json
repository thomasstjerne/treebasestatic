Their status as a natural group is debatable. In\nthe present work I describe Adeopapposaurus mognai, a new sauropodomorph\nfrom the Cañón del Colorado Formation, in northwestern Argentina.\nDiagnostic autapomorphies and combination of characters of\nAdeopapposaurus include a series of large foramina in a sub-vertical row\non the lateral surface of the premaxilla; strongly rugose depression\nbordered by a protuberance with a series of foramina in a sub-vertical\nrow, on the lateral surface of the anterior end of the dentary; eleven\nanteroposteriorly elongated cervical vertebrae and thirteen dorsal\nvertebrae with neural arches taller than the respective centra.\nPhylogenetically Adeopapposaurus is resolved as the sister group to\nMassospondylus; differing from the latter based on differences in\nmandible and premaxilla and addition of one dorsal vertebra to the neck.\nThe specimens described here reveal numerous herbivorous adaptations,\nincluding the presence of a highly vascularized bony plate in the\npremaxilla and dentary, which indicates that it had a horny beak.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 22","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sauropodomorpha phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55924.phy"}]}
