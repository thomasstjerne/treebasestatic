The data matrix\nconsists of 80 macro-morphological, palynological, and anatomical\ncharacters. The phylogenetic trees obtained show a paraphyletic\nOlacaceae with four main clades. Some of these clades are congruent with\npreviously recognized tribes, but all of subfamilies are para- or\npolyphyletic. Examination of character transformations confirms several\nassumptions of evolutionary trends within Olacaceae and Santalales,\nhowever, others appear to be more complex than expected. Optimization of\ntrophic mode on the consensus tree shows that root hemiparasitism had a\nsingle origin in Santalales. Whatever the optimization procedure used,\nthe basal-most clade of Olacaceae consists of 12 genera, among which\nfive are known to be autotrophs, whereas the remaining three clades (15\ngenera) contain four genera known to be root parasites.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Olacaceae and other Santalales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1721.phy"}]}
