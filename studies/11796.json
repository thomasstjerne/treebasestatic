In the present\nstudy, an older name introduced by Saccardo based on European material,\nRhinotrichum griseum, is shown to resemble P. hyperparasitica.\nMorphological study and ITS barcodes from fresh collections of R.\ngriseum from Austria on uredinia and telia of Phragmidium bulbosum on\nRubus spp. reveal that it is distinct from P. hyperparasitica. The\nstatus of the genus Rhinotrichum, introduced for a fungus occurring on\ndry wood, remains unclear. Pseudovirgaria grisea comb. nov. is therefore\nproposed for the mycoparasite occurring on rust fungi in Europe, and an\nepitype is designated from the recent collections.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudovirgaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47780.phy"}]}
