Despite their vital function, the causes, mechanisms and\nconstraints on CHC diversification are still poorly understood. Here, we\ninvestigated phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of CHC profiles,\nusing a global dataset of the species-rich and chemically diverse ant\ngenus Crematogaster. We decomposed CHC profiles into quantitative\n(relative abundances, chain length) and qualitative traits\n(presence/absence of CHC classes). A species-level phylogeny was\nestimated using newly generated and previously published sequences from\nfive nuclear markers. Moreover, we reconstructed a phylogeny for the\nchemically diverse C. levior species group using cytochrome oxidase I.\nPhylogenetic signal was measured for these traits on genus and clade\nlevel and within the chemically diverse C. levior group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crematogaster COI 24","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89876.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Crematogaster 5 genes 40","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89877.phy"}]}
