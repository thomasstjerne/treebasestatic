The\nentire matK gene was sequenced for two members of the family,\nSullivantia sullivantii and Saxifraga integrifolia. Comparison of base\nsubstitution rates between these two species indicated that matK evolves\napproximately three-fold faster than rbcL. Comparative sequencing of 754\nbase pairs within matK was subsequently conducted using 25 genera in\nSaxifragaceae s. str. and two outgroup taxa. Summed over the 31 taxa\nsequenced for this 754 base pair region, 40% of the base positions were\nvariable and 15.6% were potentially informative. Five insertion/deletion\nevents of three or six base pairs were also detected. Skewness and\nrandomization tests both suggest that significant non-random structure\nis present in the matK data set. Parsimony analyses provided 72 most\nparsimonious trees of 223 steps (excluding autapomorphies) with a\nconsistency index of 0.565. Several well-supported groups of genera are\nhighly concordant with relationships suggested by two other chloroplast\nDNA data sets: chloroplast DNA restriction sites and rbcL\nsequences.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig.3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifragaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1543.phy"}]}
