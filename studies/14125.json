This study\ndetermined the diversity of Phytophthora spp. within a single river\nsituated in the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Sample acquisition was\nperformed over a one year period and entailed biweekly river baiting\nusing Rhododendron indicum leaves. Phytophthora spp. were identified\nthrough phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregion of the ribosomal DNA, as well as the mitochondrial cytochrome\noxidase c subunit I (coxI) gene. Eight Phytophthora spp. were\nidentified, including a new taxon, P. taxon Sisulu-river, and two hybrid\nspecies from CookeÂ’s ITS clade 6. Of these, species from Clade 6 were the\nmost abundant, including P. taxon PgChlamydo and P. lacustris. Species\nresiding in Clade 2 were also encountered, including P. multivora, P.\nplurivora and P. citrophthora. The detection of eight species in this\nfirst investigation into Phytophthora diversity of rivers and associated\nriparian ecosystems in northern South Africa, suggests a high level of\ndiversity of these organisms in South African rivers","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62692","tree_kind":"Species
