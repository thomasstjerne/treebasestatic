Ito and S. Imai from Japan have been studied.\nSix type specimens of these species are preserved in Hokkaido University\nMuseum (SAPA), and another specimen has been preserved in Tottori\nMycological Institute (TMI). Two new combinations, namely Leucoagaricus\nsubamanitiformis, comb. nov. and Leucocoprinus boninensis, comb. nov.\nare proposed. The new name, Limacella subglischra given by Ito is\naccepted here. I have confirmed that Lepiota atrovinosa, Lepiota\ninconspicua and Lepiota ossaeiformispora certainly belong to the genus\nLepiota.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135712","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135712.phy"}]}
