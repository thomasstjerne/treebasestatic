While recent\nmolecular evidence has shown that Myriapoda is monophyletic, the\ninternal phylogeny, which is pivotal for understanding the evolutionary\nhistory of myriapods, remains unresolved. Here we report the results of\nphylogenetic analyses and estimations of divergence time and ancestral\nstate of myriapods. Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on three\nnuclear protein-coding genes determined from 19 myriapods representing\nthe four classes (17 orders) and 11 outgroup species. The results\nrevealed that Symphyla whose phylogenetic position has long been debated\nis the sister lineage to all other myriapods, and that the interordinal\nrelationships within classes were consistent with traditional\nclassifications. Ancestral state estimation based on the tree topology\nsuggests that myriapods evolved from an ancestral state that was\ncharacterized by a hemianamorphic mode of post-embryonic development and\nhad a relatively low number of body segments and legs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Myriapoda DPD1 RPB1 RPB2 MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_73443.phy"}]}
