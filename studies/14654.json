We introduce a three-dimensional finite\nelement (FE) model of the cranium that can be morphed into different\nshapes by varying simple parameters to investigate the relationship\nbetween two engineering-based measures of performance, mechanical\nadvantage and von Mises stress, and four divergent adaptive zones\noccupied by New World leaf-nosed bats. To investigate these\nrelationships,we tested the fit of Brownian motion and\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck models of evolution in mechanical advantage and von\nMises stress using dated multi-locus phylogenies. The analyses revealed\nthree performance optima for mechanical advantage among species from\nthree adaptive zones: bats that eat nectar; generalized insectivores\nomnivores and some frugivores; and bats that specialize on hard canopy\nfruits. Only two optima, one corresponding to nectar feeding, were\nconsistently uncovered for von Mises stress. These results suggest that\nmechanical advantage played a larger role than von Mises stress in the\nradiation of New World leaf-nosed bats into divergent adaptive\nzones.","trees":[{"tree_label":"DatedPosteriorTree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New World leaf-nosed bats - Dated summary","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66316.phy"},{"tree_label":"Partitioned RAxML tree","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New World leaf-nosed bats partitioned RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_66315.phy"}]}
