The elongate body form has evolved repeatedly in\ndisparate vertebrate clades and is associated with a variety of body\nsizes. We used a time-calibrated phylogeny for 40 species of moray eels\nto analyze the evolution of elongation and the morphological mechanisms\nunderlying variation in body shape and maximum body size. We find that\nbody elongation in morays evolves independent of elongation of the\nvertebral column. In contrast, large body size evolves by a different\nmechanism; through region-specific increases in vertebral number,\nelongation of individual vertebral centra, and postembryonic somatic\ngrowth. We reconstruct an ancestral moray eel and provide evidence for\naccelerated morphological evolution in three highly elongate species\nthat are associated with a burrowing lifestyle. We compare these\npatterns to those described for other vertebrates and show that body\nshape and body size may evolve independently of each other and (in the\ncase of shape) of the vertebral column.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61125","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61125.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr61126","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_61126.phy"}]}
