Its bilocular berries and two\nconnate stamens indicate no affiliation with any known species or\ninfrageneric group within Phyllanthus. Phylogenetic analyses place it as\nsister to the Indian and East African species Phyllanthus pinnatus and\nis also related to the New World species of Phyllanthus acidus and\nPhyllanthus chacoensis. Only five individuals are currently known and\nthe species is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Proposed Mefou\nNational Park near Yaound√© could save this species from extinction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25483.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Euphorbiaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_25482.phy"}]}
