The genetic diversity and haplotype network was\nanalysed with two different datasets. The first dataset has 942 base\npairs of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)\nand NADN dehydrogenase subunit I (ND1) from 105 individuals of krill\nsampled from seven localities within fishery management areas around\nAtlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during two different years. The\nsecond is the COI sequences from the first dataset combined with COI\ndata from Genbank, in total 456 base pairs for 545 individuals. The\nintermixed starburst structures of the parsimonious haplotype networks\nindicate lack of genetic structure over the sampled geographic area and\nthe time period. The haplotype diversity is high with no indications of\nisolation by distance in the samples. This conclusion is reinforced by\nanalyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) and the population statistic Fst.\nNeutrality tests and mismatch distribution for mtDNA COI and ND1\nsequences reveal strong evidence of population expansion and in\ncombination with the lack of phylogeographical structure, it may reflect\na recent range expansion.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"545","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Antarctic krill","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47830.phy"}]}
