{"Authors":" NA","Year":" 2021","Title":" Xylodon flocculosus sp. nov. (Schizoporaceae,\nHymenochaetales) bearing the flocculent hymenophore","Journal":"","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Basidiomycota; Molecular phylogeny; Taxonomy; Wood-rotting\nfungi; Yunnan Province","DOI":"","Abstract":" A new corticoid fungal species, Xylodon flocculosus sp.\nnov., is proposed based on a combination of morphological features and\nmolecular characters. Xylodon flocculosus is characterized by an annual\ngrowth habit, resupinate basidiomata grandinoid hymenial surface, a\nmonomitic hyphal system with generative hyphae bearing clamp\nconnections, strongly encrusted cystidia and ellipsoid, colorless,\nthin-walled, smooth, negative in Melzers, acyanophilous basidiospores\nmeasuring 4.25.7 × 3.14.4 µm. Sequences of ITS and LSU nrRNA gene\nregions of the studied samples were generated, and phylogenetic analyses\nwere performed with maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference methods. The phylogenetic analysis based on molecular data of\nITS+nLSU sequences showed that the new species belonged to the\nSchizoporaceae and nested into the Xylodon clade. The result\ndemonstrated that Xylodon flocculosus singly formed a well-supported\nmonophyletic lineage distinct from other Xylodon species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree
