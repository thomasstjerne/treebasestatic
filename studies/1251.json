Analyses using maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ninference yield congruent relationships among several major lineages\nfound. These lineages largely disagree with previously recognized\ntaxonomic groups. Most notably, (1) Androsace sect. Andraspis,\ncomprising the short-lived taxa, is highly polyphyletic, (2) Pomatosace\nconstitutes a separate phylogenetic lineage within Androsace, and (3)\nDouglasia and Vitaliana nest within Androsace sect. Aretia. Our results\nsuggest multiple origins of the short-lived life-form and a possible\nreversal from annual or biennial to perennial habit at the base of a\ngroup that now contains mostly perennial high mountain or arctic taxa.\nThe group containing Androsace sect. Aretia, Douglasia, and Vitaliana\nincludes predominantly high alpine and arctic taxa with an arctic-alpine\ndistribution, but is not found in the European and northeastern American\nArctic or in Central and East Asia. This group probably originated in\nEurope in the Pliocene, from where it reached the amphi-Beringian region\nin the Pleistocene or late Pliocene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3-4","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace, comb BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1949.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A-1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace, ITS MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1950.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A-2","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace, ITS BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1951.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B-1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace, trnLF MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1952.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B-2","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Androsace, trnLF BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1953.phy"}]}
