However, the abundance and size\nof introgression tracts, and to what degree interspecific gene flow is\nthe result of adaptive processes, is largely unknown.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we present medium\ncoverage genomic data from species of the filamentous ascomycete\nNeurospora, and use comparative genomics to investigate the\nintrogression landscape at the genomic level in this model genus. We\nrevealed one large introgression tract in each of the three investigated\nphylogenetic lineages of N. tetrasperma (sizes of 5.6 Mbp, 5.2 Mbp and\n4.1 Mbp, respectively). The tract is located on the chromosome\ncontaining the locus conferring sexual identity, the mating-type (mat)\nchromosome. The region of introgression is confined to the region of\nsuppressed recombination and is found on one of the two mat chromosomes\n(mat a). We used Bayesian concordance analyses to exclude incomplete\nlineage sorting as the cause for the observed pattern, and multilocus\ngenealogies from additional species of Neurospora show that the\nintrogression likely originates from two closely related, freely\nrecombining, heterothallic species (N. hispaniola and N. crassa/N.\nperkinsii). Finally, we investigated patterns of molecular evolution of\nthe mat chromosome in Neurospora, and show that introgression is\ncorrelated with reduced level of molecular degeneration, consistent with\na shorter time of recombination suppression. Conclusions/Significance:\nThe chromosome specific (mat) and allele specific (mat a) introgression\nreported herein comprise the largest introgression tracts reported to\ndate from natural populations. Furthermore, our data contradicts\ntheoretical predictions that introgression should be less likely on\nsex-determining chromosomes. Taken together, the data presented herein\nadvances our general understanding of introgression as a force shaping\neukaryotic genomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma mat_little_a","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49502.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma MatA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49491.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma prd4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49492.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma lys3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49498.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma tef1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49503.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma al1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49490.phy"},{"tree_label":"cys9","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma cys9","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49505.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma eth1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49504.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma ad9","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49489.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma lys4","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49499.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma arg1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49500.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma upr1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49501.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma rid1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49493.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP3","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma nit2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49494.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma mus42","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49495.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma ro10","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49496.phy"},{"tree_label":"bestREP1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neurospora tetrasperma phr","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_49497.phy"}]}
