Tuerckheimiana and\nsect. Valida has remained as incertae sedis within Panicum. To resolve\nthe systematic position of both sections within Paniceae s.l.,\nmorphological studies and phylogenetic analyses based on chloroplast\nsequence data (ndhF) were conducted. Our study shows that both sections\nare included in the subtribe Paspalinae of tribe Paspaleae, where they\nare related with the genus Anthaenantiopsis. These results support the\nrecent transfer of these species to the recently described genera Aakia\nand Osvaldoa; they are restricted to forests of Mesoamerica and lowlands\nof southern South America respectively. These genera are described and\ncompared with other allied genera of subtribe Paspalinae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"CSndhF","ntax":"251","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Panicoideae Strict Consensus ndhF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74851.phy"}]}
