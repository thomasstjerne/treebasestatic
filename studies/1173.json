Analyses by parsimony,\nneighbor- joining, Bayesian, and metapopulation genetic algorithm gave\nsimilar results. Scapaniaceae are monophyletic and forming a terminal\nclade within Lophoziaceae, whereas the latter (excluding Leiocolea and\nsometimes also Hattoriella) form a paraphyletic grade. Leiocolea\nrutheana is found closely related to Mesoptychia, and species of\nLeiocolea and Mesoptychia form a well-supported clade nested within the\nJungermanniaceae in parsimony and neighbor- joining analyses. Present\nresults support the usage of a narrow generic concept in Lophoziaceae\nand Jungermanniaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lophoziaceae and related Jungermanniales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1814.phy"}]}
