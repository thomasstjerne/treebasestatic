The new species\nis ecologically and morphologically similar to Marchandiobasidium\naurantiacum, teleomorph of the common bulbilliferous lichen pathogen\nMarchandiomyces aurantiacus. However, phylogenetic analysis of nuclear\nand mitochondrial rDNA sequences indicated a close relationship of the\nnew species not to M. aurantiacum but to turf grass pathogens in the\ngenera Laetisaria and Limonomyces, including the generic type of\nLaetisaria. We are including the new species in Laetisaria based on\nstrong statistical support for the clade containing these teleomorphs\nand several Marchandiomyces anamorphs. The morphological and ecological\ndiversity of this group indicates an important evolutionary role played\nby lichen-associated species in the Corticiales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21340","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21340.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr21339","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_21339.phy"}]}
