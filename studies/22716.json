Cankers occur\non tree trunks and branches and may reduce growth and lead to plant\ndeath. In this study, the incidence and pathogenicity of C. cubensis and\nother species causing canker on Eucalyptus spp., Tibouchina heteromalla\nand T. granulosa were examined.The isolates, collected in Maranhão (MA)\nand Minas Gerais (MG) in Brazil, were subjected to multilocus analysis\nusing beta-tubulin and actin. Sequence analysis of the genomic regions\nconfirmed the presence of C. cubensis and C. doradensis on clones of the\nhybrid Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla.,T. granulosa, and T.\nheteromalla in Brazil. Morphological characterization enabled the\nidentification of the isolates from both genera, primarily based on\ndifferences in conidial size and shape. Pathogenicity tests proved the\nisolates were pathogenic to 10 Eucalyptus clones and Tibouchina plants.\nThe results obtained may contribute to the knowledge of Chrysoporthe\nspecies causing diseases of woody plants in Brazil. For this reason,\nEucalyptus breeding programs should consider this in screening for\nresistance. Furthermore, this is the first report of C. doradensis as a\npathogen on Eucalyptus and T. granulosa, as well as the first record of\nC. cubensis on T. heteromalla in Brazil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Zambiensis Artigo Padronizado BT1BT2ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111882.phy"}]}
