It has been hypothesized that E. mammata\nwas introduced to Europe from North America. In this study, E. mammata\nisolates collected from Europe and North America were compared by a\nsequence analysis of two DNA markers derived from DNA fingerprints. The\nobjective of the study was to elucidate the relationship between North\nAmerican and European E. mammata populations by testing two hypotheses:\ni) North American and European isolates are conspecific. ii) The fungus\nwas introduced between continents causing both a founder effect and a\ngenetic bottleneck. North American populations were found to be more\npolymorphic, but no major phylogenetic differences between fungal\nisolates collected from different continents were found. This result\ncombined with the historical observations of the disease in Europe\nimplies that E. mammata was introduced to Europe several centuries\nago.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Hcat tree","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entoleuca mammata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1791.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hgag tree","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Entoleuca mammata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1790.phy"}]}
