It is characterized by a effused brown basidiocarp,\na monomitic hyphal system, yellowish brown generative hyphae without\nclamp connections, numerous hyphal ends in hymenium and subhymenium, and\nsmall ellipsoid basidiospores measured as 4.75.3 2.53.1 µm.\nMorphologically, P. porostereoides resembles Porostereum, but\nphylogenetic analyses of the combined sequences of ITS and nLSU show\nthat it is nested within the Phanerochaete s.s. clade, and not closely\nrelated to Porostereum spadiceum, type of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete porostereoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101036.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete porostereoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101038.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete porostereoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101037.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phanerochaete porostereoides","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_101039.phy"}]}
