More recently,\nthese unusual fungi have been found for the first time outside Africa on\nCecropia in South America. During the course of an investigation into\nthe decline and death of native Euphorbia trees in South Africa, several\nfungal isolates resembling the anamorph state of Gondwanamyces were\nobtained from diseased tissues. In this study, these isolates are\nidentified based on morphology and comparisons of DNA sequences. Two\npreviously unknown Gondwanamyces spp. were identified, one of which was\nassociated with damage caused by a coleopteran beetle. Inoculation\nstudies showed that the new Gondwanamyces spp. are pathogenic on\nEuphorbia ingens and could contribute to the decline of these\ntrees.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Real tree","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46178","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46178.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46179","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46179.phy"},{"tree_label":"gond tree update","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr46177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_46177.phy"}]}
