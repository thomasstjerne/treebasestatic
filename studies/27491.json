Canoparmelia amazonica, Myelochroa lindmanii, and\nParmelinella salacinifera are species of Parmeliaceae that have yet to\nbe studied in detail with molecular methods. This study used analyses of\nITS sequences to examine the phylogenetic position of these three\nspecies. Canoparmelia amazonica and M. lindmanii were recovered within\nParmelinella rather than the genera to which they are currently\nassigned. While for the P. salacinifera we confirmed its phylogenetic\nposition within the genus. Chemical and morphological descriptions of\nspecies are provided, generic placement is discussed, and new\ncombinations are proposed as needed. These results highlight the need\nfor morphological revision of the delimitation of Parmelinella, a small\ngenus of Parmeliaceae that has been considered well-defined\nmorphologically and is phylogenetically closely related to Bulbothrix\ns.l.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128279","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128279.phy"}]}
