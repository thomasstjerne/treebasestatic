Monophyly\nof the tribe is well supported by male genitalia synapomorphies. Strict\nconsensus supports two sub-clades:\n((Montrouzierana+Thymbra)+Thaumantia+) sister to (Leptovanua,\nVanua+Varma+, Daradacella). (Montrouzierana+Thymbra) clade, distributed\nin New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea is well supported by 3 tegmina\nsynapomorphies, while the Thaumantia+ group is characterized by anal\ntube and male gonostyli conformation, a distributed from Malesia to\nPapuasia and west side up to central Africa. The second sub-clade is\ndistributed from China to Malesia, Papuasia, Southwest and Northwest\nPacific islands. Position of the genus Leptovanua remains uncertain. The\nVarma+ clade is recovered in all analysis. Implied weighting analysis\nplaced the Varma+ lineage sister to all other genera forming a new group\n(Leptovanua+ + ((Montrouzierana + Thymbra) + Thaumantia+)). Fennahs\n(1982) definition of Tropiduchini is reviewed according to the\nphylogenetic results and identification key to all genera is provided\nwith a referenced synopsis of their distribution. Globally, Tropiduchini\nexhibits an inter-tropical latitudinal profile and a paradoxical bimodal\nlongitudinal distribution pattern in continental Africa, South-East Asia\nand Pacific islands area. Distribution areas of the recovered clades\nconcern nearly 80% of insular taxa, confronted with the phylogenetic\nresults, indicate that the tribe originates probably from continental\nChina and evolved mainly for Papuasia by stepping-stone colonization\nevents, promoting subsequent insular speciations, and dispersion versus\nvicariance has mainly directed the evolution of the tribe.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 9","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96141.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96133.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 10","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96142.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96132.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96137.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 4","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96136.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 8","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96140.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 7","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96139.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96138.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96135.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tropiduchini","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96134.phy"}]}
