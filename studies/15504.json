The statistical\ninterpretation indicated metabolite variations among the two newly\nisolated strains compared to the three type strains of the genus\nSpirochaeta. Significant metabolite variations between JC202T and JC227T\nisolated from hind gut of insects led to polyphasic characterization of\nthe strains and resulted in the proposal to describe two novel species,\nSpirochaeta odontotermitis sp. nov. and Spirochaeta periplanata sp.\nnov.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Spirochaeta","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_71661.phy"}]}
