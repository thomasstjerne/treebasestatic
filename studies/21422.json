Gymnosporangium corniforme was demonstrated to\nproduce spermogonia and aecia on Sorbus randaiensis based on molecular\nanalyses and inoculation experiments. The pear rust pathogen G. unicorne\nwas discovered in Taiwan for the first time. Gymnosporangium\nniitakayamense sp. nov. was observed on the leaves of Photinia\nniitakayamensis. It was distinct from other species in peridial cell\nwall structures, i.e., smooth outer wall, rugose side wall, and\ncoralloid projections on the inner wall, and in having echinulate\naeciospores.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnosporangium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110807.phy"}]}
