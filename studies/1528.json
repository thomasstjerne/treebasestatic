Previous\nstudies based on anatomical, morphological and molecular data have\nalready revealed a close relationship between Nylandtia and Muraltia, a\ngenus of 117 species that is nearly endemic to South Africa. New\nevidence from molecular studies of family Polygalaceae and genus\nMuraltia shows that Nylandtia is derived from genus Muraltia, and is\nnested in Muraltia subgenus Psiloclada. These results have prompted a\nmorphological re-evaluation of the genera Nylandtia and Muraltia,\nsupporting the conclusion that the two species of Nylandtia currently\nrecognized, N. spinosa and N. scoparia, should be included in subgenus\nPsiloclada within the genus Muraltia. Only one nomenclatural change is\nnecessary: Muraltia spinosa (L.) F. Forest & J.C.
