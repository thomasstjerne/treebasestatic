This\nstudy investigates the phylogenetic relationships of sect. Herpystichum\nand evaluates several phylogenetic methods for analysis of multiple\nsequences.  Methods: Sequence data from seven nuclear (ITS, GBSSI, and\nfive COSII) and three plastid (psbAtrnH, trnTtrnF, and trnStrnG) regions\nwere concatenated and analyzed under maximum parsimony and Bayesian\ncriteria. In addition, we used two analysis methods that take into\naccount differences in topologies resulting from the analyses of the\nindividual markers: Bayesian Estimation of Species Trees (BEST) and\nsupertree analysis.  Key Results: The monophyletic Solanum sect.\nHerpystichum was resolved with moderate support in the concatenated\nmaximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses and the supertree analysis, and\nrelationships within the section were well-resolved and strongly\nsupported. The BEST topology, however, was poorly resolved. Also,\nbecause of how BEST deals with missing sequences, > 25% of our\naccessions, including two species, had to be excluded from the analyses.\nOur results indicate a progenitor-descendent relationship with two\nspecies nested within the widespread S. evolvulifolium.  Conclusions:\nAnalysis methods that consider individual topologies are important for\nstudies based on multiple molecular markers. Based on the analyses in\nthis study, BEST had the serious shortcoming that taxa with missing\nsequences must be removed from the analysis, or they may produce\nspurious topologies. Supertree analysis provided a good alternative for\nour data by allowing the inclusion of all 10 species of sect.\nHerpystichum.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1-cos10B","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanum sect.
