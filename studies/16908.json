To date, little information is available on fungal\nlineages that might have undergone convergent evolution to adapt to\nmultiple mode of life. We examined the phylogenetic relationship and\nevolutionary divergence between aquatic hyphomycetes, endophytic aquatic\nhyphomycetes and other fungal endophytes of riparian/terrestrial plants\nby exploring ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rRNA gene sequences retrieved from National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). It is revealed that\nsequences with close phylogenetic affinity to aquatic fungi can occur as\nendophytes in the terrestrial plants far from the stream-sides. To\npropel the study of fungal ecology, we need to assign a vast ecological\nniche for aquatic fungi and further its ecological role has to be\nthoroughly explored.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"573","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Aquatic Hyphomycetes and Endophytic fungi ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_80769.phy"}]}
