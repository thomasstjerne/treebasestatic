Such\nunidentified sequences belonging to the widely distributed\nectomycorrhizal fungal genus Inocybe were retrieved from GenBank and\ndivided into species that were identified in a phylogenetic context\nthrough a reference dataset from an ongoing study of the genus. Sequence\nmetadata stored in GenBank, as well as data from the corresponding\noriginal papers, were compiled and used to explore the ecology and\ndistribution of the genus. In addition, the relative occurrence of\nInocybe was contrasted to other mycorrhizal genera. Results: Most\nspecies of Inocybe were found to have less than 3% intraspecific\nvariability in the ITS2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. This\ncut-off value was used jointly with phylogenetic analysis to delimit and\nidentify unidentified Inocybe sequences to species level. A total of 177\nunidentified Inocybe ITS sequences corresponding to 98 species were\nrecovered, 32% of which were successfully identified to species level in\nthis study. These sequences accounts for an unexpectedly large\nproportion of the publicly available unidentified fungal ITS sequences\nwhen compared with other mycorrhizal genera. Eight Inocybe species were\nreported from multiple hosts and some even from hosts forming arbutoid\nor orchid mycorrhizae. Furthermore, Inocybe sequences have been reported\nfrom four continents and in climate zones ranging from cold temperate to\nequatorial climate. Out of the 19 species found in more than one study,\nsix were found in both Europe and North America and one was found in\nboth Europe and Japan, indicating that at least many north temperate\nspecies have a wide distribution. Conclusions: Although DNA-based\nspecies identification and circumscription are associated with practical\nand conceptual difficulties, they also offer new possibilities and\navenues for research. Metadata assembly holds great potential to\nsynthesize valuable information from community studies for use in a\nspecies and taxonomy-oriented framework.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Clade 3 strict","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5072.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a Clade 1 Strict","ntax":"71","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5070.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 8 Strict","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5077.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 9 MPT","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5078.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 16 Strict","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5085.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fully identified Adams","ntax":"278","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5086.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2c Clade 10 Strict","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5079.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 11 Strict","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5080.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 2 strict","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5071.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 4 Strict","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5073.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2b Clade 5 Strict","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5074.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 6 Strict","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5075.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 7 Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5076.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 12 Strict","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5081.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 13 Strict","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5082.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 14 Strict","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5083.phy"},{"tree_label":"Clade 15 Strict","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Inocybe","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5084.phy"}]}
