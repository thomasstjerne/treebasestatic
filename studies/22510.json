In this study, we investigated the relationships of a\nnumber of interesting Acarospora collections from western North America\nusing morphological, chemical, and molecular sequence data. Our results\nrevealed patterns of apparent convergence of some morphologies\ntraditionally considered a single taxon, coupled with a striking range\nof morphological disparity within other lineages. Based on these\nresults, a species of lichen-forming fungi, Acarospora tintica sp. nov.,\nis formally described as a new to science, occurring on hard limestone\nsubstrates in the Great Basin of western North America. This species\nbelongs to a well-supported clade comprised of morphologically diverse\nspecies-level lineages. Furthermore, a number of additional candidate\nspecies are recognized and merit additional research before formal\ntaxonomic recognition. This study highlights the importance of\nimplementing an integrative taxonomic approach, incorporating a broad\nrange of data, including molecular sequence data, for diagnosing\nevolutionarily independent species-level lineages in lichen-forming\nfungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116117","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116117.phy"}]}
