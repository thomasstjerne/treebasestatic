The\n650 base-pair, 3’ portion of the ETS examined here showed a level of\nvariation across taxa similar to that of the ITS sequences included. A\nmaximum-likelihood tree based on combined ETS and ITS sequences leads us\nto suggest that the New World species of true thistles constitute a\nmajor lineage, which in turn comprises several smaller lineages. A\nwestern North American lineage shows weak quartet-puzzling support, but\nincludes a well-supported lineage of species endemic to the California\nFloristic Province. Comparisons of this Californian lineage with other\nneoendemic angiosperm groups of the region show that the Californian\nCirsium lineage exhibits unusually high ecological diversity for a group\ndisplaying such low levels of rDNA sequence divergence across taxa.\nSimilarly low levels of sequence divergence were found throughout the\nNew World Cirsium lineage. These results indicate either that Cirsium\nunderwent a rapid ecological radiation in North America, or that rDNA\nevolution in North American Cirsium has been highly conservative.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"New World thistles","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_841.phy"}]}
