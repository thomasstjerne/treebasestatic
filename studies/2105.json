The\nholomorphs of two closely related species, H. alni and H.\nbrunneoviridis, are described as new species of the genus. They are\ncharacterized with morphological and molecular methods, including\nculture studies, and phylogenetic analyses using the internal\ntranscribed spacers 1 and 2 as a part of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster,\ncalmodulin, endochitinase, intron 4 of the translation elongation factor\n1-alpha gene, and a part of the RNA polymerase II subunit B gene as\nphylogenetic markers. All species described here have green ascospores.\nAlthough phylogenetically closely related to H. lixii, they form\nreddish-brown instead of green to black stromata. Except for H.\nbrunneoviridis, forming nearly gliocladium-like conidiophores, the\nanamorphs of these species are similar to each other, but vary in the\nangles of conidiophore branches and phialides, in phenotypic arrangement\nof conidiation on growth plates and in growth rates of cultures.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"77","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypocrea with reddish-brown stromata and green\nascospores.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3065.phy"}]}
