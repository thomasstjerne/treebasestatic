Methods: Whole\ngenome sequencing (WGS) of M.tb clinical strains (161 cases) was\nconducted. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by Maximum Likelihood\n(ML) on the basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and verified\nvia principal component analysis (PCA). The composition structure of\nM.tb in different regions was analyzed by combining geographic\ninformation. Results: The M.tb clinical strains were composed of lineage\n2 (73/161, 45.34%), lineage 3 (52/161, 32.30%) and lineage 4 (36/161,\n22.36%) in Kashgar prefecture. And the 3 lineages were subdivided into\n11 sublineages, among which lineage 2 includes lineage 2.2.2/Asia\nAncestral 1(9/73, 12.33%)，lineage 2.2.1-Asia Ancestral 2(9/73,\n12.33%)，lineage 2.2.1-Asia Ancestral 3(18/73, 24.66%) and lineage\n2.2.1-Modern Beijing(39/73, 53.42%).Lineage 3 includes lineage\n3.2(14/52, 26.92%)and lineage 3.3(38/52, 73.08%)，lineage 4 includes\nlineage 4.1(3/36, 8.33%)，lineage 4.2(2/36, 5.66%)，lineage 4.4.2(1/36,\n2.78%)，lineage 4.5(28/36, 77.78%) and lineage 4.8(2/36, 5.66%)，all of\nwhich were consistent with the PCA results. Among the identified 21438\nSNPs ,there are 136 markers proposed to discriminate known circulating\nstrains. Reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree using the 136 SNPs for\nall 161 samples resulted in a tree with the same number of delineated\nclades. Based on geographical location analysis, the composition of\nLineage 2 in Kashgar prefecture (45.34%) is lower than other regions\nlevel in China(54.35%-90.27%), and the composition of Lineage 3\n(32.30%)is much higher than other regions level in China (0.92%-2.01%),\nbut it is lower than the bordering Pakistan (70.40%).","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"161","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134005","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134005.phy"}]}
