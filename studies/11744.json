However, the role of these mountains in the\ndiversification of insects, which dominate biodiversity, has been poorly\nexplored using phylogenetic methods. Here we study the role of the Andes\nin the evolution of a diverse Neotropical insect group, the clearwing\nbutterflies. We used dated species-level phylogenies to investigate the\ntime course of speciation and to infer ancestral elevation ranges for\ntwo diverse genera. We show that both genera likely originated at middle\nelevations in the Andes in the Middle Miocene, contrasting with most\npublished results in vertebrates that point to a lowland origin.\nAlthough we detected a signature of vicariance caused by the uplift of\nthe Andes at the MiocenePliocene boundary, most sister species were\nparapatric without any obvious vicariant barrier. Combined with an\noverall decelerating speciation rate, these results suggest an important\nrole for ecological speciation and adaptive radiation, rather than\nsimple vicariance.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Napeogenes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47670.phy"}]}
