The sequences were aligned and\nused for species characterization and differentiation. Sequence length\nvaried from 916 to 1061 base pairs (bp) in length. Restriction mapping\nof these sequences showed diagnostic variation such that the number of\ncuts and the length of the resulting fragments can be used for species\ndifferentiation. The composition and ratio of sequence similarity allow\nfor further characterization of the ten nematode species. Phylogenetic\nrelationships among the sampled Steinernema taxa were estimated by\nmaximum parsimony and maximum-likelihood. Our results support the\nutility of the ITS region for differentiation of the nematode species of\nthe genus Steinernema. The ITS region appears to be phylogenetically\ninformative for closely related sister species, but high variability\namong more distantly related taxa preclude its use for resolving\nrelationships among all members of the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"5.8s MP Tree (1 of 2)","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Establishing a root for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5561.phy"},{"tree_label":"5.8s MP Tree (2 of 2)","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Establishing a root for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5562.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1 MP Tree (2 of 2)","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5563.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS1 MP Tree (1 of 2)","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5564.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS ML tree Fig. 2C","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML solution for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5558.phy"},{"tree_label":"KingConcat","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5559.phy"},{"tree_label":"contree of two trimmed Fig. 2D","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ML & MP consensus tree for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5560.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree2 trimmed Fig. 2B","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP solution for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5556.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree1 trimmed Fig. 2A","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP solution for Steinernema","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5557.phy"}]}
