The molecular phylogenetic analysis using\nthe combined dataset of ITS, LSU, mtSSU and RPB2, and morphological\nexamination revealed Erioscyphella can be defined mainly focusing on the\nlength of ascospores and hair-structures, but still contains some\nspecies presenting exceptional morphology. Five new species and three\nnew combination were proposed. With the addition of new taxa,\nErioscyphella was proved to have high species diversity also in the\ntemperate to subarctic zone in the Northern hemisphere.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ImportTree","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132040","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132040.phy"}]}
