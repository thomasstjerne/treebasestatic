Aleurodiscus alpinus is from\nnorthwest Yunnan of China where it occurs on Rhododendron in montane\nhabitats. Aleurodiscus pinicola occurs on Pinus in montane settings in\nTaiwan and northwest Yunnan. Aleurodiscus rimosus is from subtropical\nTaiwan, where it occurs on angiosperms. Aleurodiscus sichuanensis\noriginates from southwest China on angiosperms in montane environments.\nPhylogenetic relationships of these four new species were inferred\nrespectively from analyses of nuc rDNA 28S D1Â–D2 domains (28S), and a\ncombined dataset included three gene regions of 28S, nuc rDNA\nITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS), and a portion of the translation elongation factor\n1-alpha gene, TEF1.","trees":[{"tree_label":"0921 Alu RaxML","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114714","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114714.phy"},{"tree_label":"0921 Alu merg MB.nwk","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr114716","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_114716.phy"}]}
