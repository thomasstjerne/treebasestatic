Five of these lineages heretofore had been\ncircumscribed in tribe Mutisieae (Cichorioideae), a taxon shown by\nearlier molecular studies to be paraphyletic and to include some of the\ndeepest divergences of the family. Combined analyses of 10 chloroplast\nDNA loci by different phylogenetic methods yielded highly congruent\nwell-resolved trees with 95% of the branches receiving moderate to\nstrong statistical support. Our strategy of sampling genera identified\nby morphological studies as anomalous, supported by broader character\nsampling than previous studies, resulted in identification of several\nnovel clades. The generic compositions of subfamilies Carduoideae,\nGochnatioideae, Hecastocleidoideae, Mutisioideae, Pertyoideae,\nStifftioideae, and Wunderlichioideae are novel in Asteraceae systematics\nand the taxonomy of the family has been revised to reflect only\nmonophyletic groups. Our results contradict earlier hypotheses that\nearly divergences in the family took place on and spread from the\nGuayana Highlands (Pantepui Province of northern South America) and\nraise new hypotheses about how Asteraceae dispersed out of the continent\nof their origin. Several nodes of this new phylogeny illustrate the vast\ndifferential in success of sister lineages suggesting focal points for\nfuture study of species diversification. Our results also provide a\nbackbone exemplar of Asteraceae for supertree construction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69705","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69705.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69706","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69706.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69707","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69707.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69708","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69708.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69709","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69709.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 18","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69716","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69716.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 19","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69717","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69717.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 20","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69718","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69718.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69719","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69719.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 22","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69720","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69720.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 28","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69726","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69726.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 29","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69727","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69727.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 72","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69728","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69728.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69710","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69710.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 13","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69711","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69711.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 14","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69712","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69712.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 15","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69713","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69713.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 16","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69714","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69714.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 17","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69715","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69715.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 23","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69721","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69721.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 24","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69722","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69722.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 25","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69723","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69723.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 26","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69724","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69724.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 27","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69725","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69725.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69702","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69702.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69703","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69703.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69704","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69704.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69699","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69699.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69700","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69700.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"108","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr69701","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_69701.phy"}]}
