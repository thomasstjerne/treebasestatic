In this study, we incorporated\ndata on the reproductive system, including features related to the male\nsperm and sperm storage by females, to supplement existing data on adult\nmorphology (for a total of 50 characters). Three nuclear DNA markers\n(18S rDNA approximately 1800 bp, the D1 region of 28S rDNA approximately\n320 bp, and histone H3 approximately 330 bp) were sequenced from 21\nspecies of fabriciids. We assessed the phylogeny of Fabriciidae based on\nan integrative analysis of these morphological and molecular characters.\nOur results show that, in addition to three previously recovered\napomorphies for Fabriciidae (absence of ventral lips, modification of\nabdominal uncini to an elongate manubrium, and presence of branchial\nhearts), six more apomorphies associated with the reproductive system\ncan be used to support this cladespermiogenesis only in the thorax,\nspermiogenesis in large clusters with a central cytophore, single dorsal\nsperm duct, sperm nuclear projection, thickening of the sperm nuclear\nmembrane and the sperm extra-axonemal sheath. The results require the\nerection of two new genera and two new species, which are\ndescribed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabriciidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21534.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabriciidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21536.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabriciidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21537.phy"},{"tree_label":"Partition 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabriciidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_31375.phy"},{"tree_label":"Tree 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fabriciidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_21535.phy"}]}
