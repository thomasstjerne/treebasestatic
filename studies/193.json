Two genera of Velloziaceae (Barbacenia, Vellozia) and three\neach from the bromeliad subfamilies Tillandsioideae (Glomeropitcairnia,\nGuzmania, Vriesea) and Bromelioideae (Hohenbergia, Neoregelia, and\nOrthophytum) were used individually to determine the polarity of the\ncharacters of Pitcairnioideae. The most parsimonious phylogenetic\nreconstruction suggests three monophyletic lineages within the\nsubfamily. Brocchinia represents its own, perhaps ancient lineage;\nAyensua, Connellia, Cottendorfia, Fosterella, Navia, Pepinia,\nPitcairnia, and Steyerbromelia constitute the second monophyletic group;\nand Abromeitiella, Brewcaria, Deuterocohnia, Dyckia, Encholirium,\nHechtia, and Puya the third. Together with the present day geographic\ndistributions of taxa and the past environmental changes in the\nNeotropics, this study concludes that the subfamily has radiated from\nthe Guayana Highlands to several geographical areas.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pitcairnioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4274.phy"}]}
