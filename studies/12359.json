Of these, four best\narsenic remediating isolates were tested for plant growth promotion\neffects on rice and pea in the present study. A greenhouse based pot\nexperiment was conducted using soil inoculums of individual fungi.\nResults indicate significant (p<0.05) increase in plant growth and\nimprovement in soil properties in case of inoculated soils compared to\ncontrol. Significant increase in plant growth were recorded in treated\nsoils and varied from 16-293%. Soil chemical and enzymatic properties\nvaried from 20-222% and 34-760%, respectively in inoculated soil. Plants\ninoculated with inoculums of Westerdykella and Trichoderma showed better\nstimulatory effects on plant growth and soil nutrient availability than\nRhizopus and Lasiodiplodia. These fungi improved soil nutrient content\nand enhanced plant growth. These fungi may be used as bioinoculants for\nplant growth promotion and improved soil properties in arsenic\ncontaminated agricultural soils.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rhizopus oryzae and R. delmar","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50953.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50955.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Westerdykella sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50954.phy"},{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Trichoderma sp. and Hypocrea sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50956.phy"}]}
