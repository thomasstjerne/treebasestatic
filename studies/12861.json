This\nsituation is largely due to an inadequate sample of eimerian molecular\ndata that can be used for reliable phylogenetic analyses. In this study,\nwe extend the data set with 71 new sequences of coccidia infecting 16\nsmall-mammal genera, mostly rodents. According to the feasibility of the\nPCR gene amplification, the new samples are represented by one or more\nof the following genes: 18S rRNA, ORF 470 and COI. Phylogenetic analyses\nwith these sequences confirm the previous hypothesis that Eimeria, in\nits current morphology-based delimitation, is not a monophyletic group.\nSeveral samples of coccidia corresponding morphologically to other\ngenera are scattered among the Eimeria lineages. More importantly, the\ndistribution of eimerians from different hosts indicates that the\nclustering of eimerian species is influenced by their host specificity,\nbut does not arise from a cophylogenetic/cospeciation process; while\nseveral clusters are specific to a particular host group, inner\ntopologies within these clusters do not reflect host phylogeny. This\nobservation suggests that the host specificity of Eimeria is caused by\nadaptive rather than cophylogenetic processes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54947.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian ORF470","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54950.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian ORF470","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54951.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54953.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Eimerian concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54954.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54943.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian 18S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54944.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian ORF470","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54949.phy"},{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian COI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54948.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"137","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eimerian concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_54952.phy"}]}
