It is homothallic and\nproduces semipapillate sporangia, smooth-walled oogonia containing\nthick-walled oospores, and paragynous antheridia. Although\nmorphologically similar to P. citricola, phylogenetic analyses of the\nITS and coxI gene regions demonstrate that P. multivora is unique.\nPhytophthora multivora is pathogenic to bark and cambium of E.\ngomphocephala and E. marginata and is believed to be involved in the\ndecline syndrome of both eucalypt species within the tuart woodland in\nsouth-west Western Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6028.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS BS","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6029.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS Bayes","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6429.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6107.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX BS","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6108.phy"},{"tree_label":"COX Bayes","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phytophthora multivora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6212.phy"}]}
