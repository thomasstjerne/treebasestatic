This family\ncomprises eight genera: Atriolum, Clitella, Didemnum, Diplosoma,\nLeptoclinides, Lissoclinum, Polysyncraton and Trididemnum. Morphological\nand molecular data suggest that Didemnidae are monophyletic, but the\nmonophyly of each didemnid genus and their phylogenetic relationships\nare still poorly understood. This study aimed at evaluating the\nmonophyly of six of the eight didemnid genera, based on mitochondrial\n(COI) and nuclear (18S) sequences. All genera were recovered as\nmonophyletic, except Trididemnum. Didemnum is comprised of two clades\nthat can be distinguished by the presence of an atrial lip, the number\nof testicular lobes, and the number of ampullae in larvae. These\nmorphological differences support a new taxon within Didemnum.\nMorphological evidence and previous taxonomists have suggested a close\nrelationship between Didemnum and Polysyncraton, as well as between\nDiplosoma and Lissoclinum. We re-evaluate these hypotheses, which are\nsupported by our 18S sequences and concatenated data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didemnidae COI BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97297.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S + COI BI","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didemnidae 18S + COI BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97361.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S + COI ML","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didemnidae 18S + COI ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97362.phy"},{"tree_label":"18S ML","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr97360","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_97360.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI tree","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didemnidae 18S BI","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97359.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML AA","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didemnidae COI AA","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97358.phy"}]}
