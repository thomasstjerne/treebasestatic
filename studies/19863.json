The new species differs from other\nConidiobolus species by forming mycelial strand with 2Â–6 aerial\nphototropic hyphae, and by its two types of primary conidiophores: one\nis shorter and differentiated from aerial hyphae, the other is often\nlonger and inflated and arises from substrate mycelia. Molecular\nphylogeny inferred from the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA supports\nC. stilbeus as a distinct species in the genus Conidiobolus, most\nclosely related to C. lachnodes, C. sinensis, C. stromoideus and C.\nthromboides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidiobolus, MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98462.phy"}]}
