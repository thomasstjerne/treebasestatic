Other morphologically related taxa arise from this\ntaxonomic approach. Fulvifomes cedrelae is not accept as a synonym of F.\nrobiniae and Fulvifomes squamosus sp. nov. is described as new based on\nPeruvian specimens. Based on morphology, phylogenetic relationships and\nhost distributions, the taxonomic implication for the genus and other\ntaxa are deeply discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fulvifomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108556.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fulvifomes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_108557.phy"}]}
