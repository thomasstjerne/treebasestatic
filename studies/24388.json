Its evolutionary relationships, however,\nhave remained obscure, largely because of a lack of material available\nfor either osteological or genetic analysis. Here we show using\nDNA-sequence data from both nuclear and mitochondrial genes that this\nspecies is sister to the allopatric Little Black Cormorant (P.\nsulcirostris), which occurs from Java in the west through southern\nIndonesia and New Guinea to Australia and New Zealand in the south. We\nestimate this split to have happened 2.5Â–3.2 million years ago, during\nthe late Pliocene. We also report on genetic variation within the\nmitochondrial control region, which suggests that this part of the\ngenome may be useful in investigating if there is genetic structure\nacross the geographical range of the Indian Cormorant.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phalacrocoracidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117246.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phalacrocoracidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117245.phy"}]}
