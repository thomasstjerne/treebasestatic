Phylogenies based on the three nuc rDNA markers, based on\ncultures from Canada and the United States, suggest that the genus is\nsynonymous with Tulasnella rather than Tremella. Morphological studies\nof 38 herbarium specimens, including type specimens of four of the seven\ndescribed species, and DNA sequence analysis suggest that other species\nattributed to Hormomyces are either conspecific with H. aurantiacus, or\nare unlikely to be related to Tulasnella. The conidial chains produced\nby H. aurantiacus are similar to monilioid cells produced by anamorphs\nof Tulasnella, often referred to the anamorph genus Epulorhiza. The new\ncombination Tulasnella aurantiaca is proposed and the species is\nredescribed, illustrated and compared with similar fungi. The ecological\nniche of T. aurantiaca and its possible relationship to orchid root\nendophytes is discussed. A key to anamorph genera with similar conidium\nontogeny to T. aurantiaca is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnella aurantiaca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121813.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tulasnella aurantiaca","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121814.phy"}]}
