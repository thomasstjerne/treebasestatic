Here we use morphological and\nmolecular data to revise the inquiline genus Synophrus, which are\nnotable for extensively modifying the structure of galls induced by oak\ngallwasp hosts on oaks in the section Cerris of Quercus subgenus Quercus\nin the Western-Palaearctic. Synophrus is of particular significance in\nthe diversification of the Synergini because it is assumed to be an\nearly diverging lineage in the Western-Palaearctic. Previous taxonomic\ntreatments have recognised three Western Palaearctic species of\nSynophrus: S. pilulae Houard, 1911, S. politus Hartig, 1843, and S.\nolivieri Kieffer, 1898. Our results support the establishment of four\nfurther Western Palaearctic species: Synophrus hungaricus Melika &\nMikó, sp. n., S. libani Melika & Pujade-Villar, sp. n., S. syriacus\nMelika, sp. n. and S. hispanicus Pujade-Villar, sp. n. We describe and\ndiagnose these new taxa, identify their phylogenetic relationship, and\nprovide an updated morphological key to the genus Synophrus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Synophrus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6636.phy"}]}
