We investigate\nthe role of diversification rate heterogeneity in shaping patterns of\ndiversity across families of extant bats. To provide a robust framework\nfor macroevolutionary inference, we assemble a time-calibrated,\nspecies-level phylogeny using a supermatrix of mitochondrial and nuclear\nsequence data. We analyze the phylogeny using a Bayesian method for\nmodeling complex evolutionary dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that\nvariation in family richness can largely be explained without invoking\nheterogeneous diversification dynamics. We document only a single\nwell-supported shift in diversification dynamics across bats, occurring\nat the base of the subfamily Stenodermatinae. Bat diversity is\nphylogenetically imbalanced, but - contrary to previous hypotheses -\nthis pattern is unexplained by any simple patterns of diversification\nrate heterogeneity. This discordance may indicate that diversification\ndynamics are more complex than can be captured using the statistical\ntools available for modeling data at this scale. We infer that bats as a\nwhole are almost entirely the product of a single adaptive radiation,\nwith decelerating speciation through time. There is also a significant\nrelationship between clade age and richness, suggesting that global bat\ndiversity may still be expanding.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Tree1","ntax":"815","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Chiroptera","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_87680.phy"}]}
