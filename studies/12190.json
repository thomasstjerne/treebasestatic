Based on morphological\ncharacters and multilocus sequence data, one strain was identified as C.\nboninense, one strain was C. brevispora, two strains were C. fructicola,\n29 strains were C. gloeosporioides, two were C. karstii, one was C.\nsimmondsii, while two strains were described as Colletotrichum sp.\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides was original isolated from Citrus\nsinensis in southern Italy. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is the most\ncommon species associated with diseased leaves of Citrus in China.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50098","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50098.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50099","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50099.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50100","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50100.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 4","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50101","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50101.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 5","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50102","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50102.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 6","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50103","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50103.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 7","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50104","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50104.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 8","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50105","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50105.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 9","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50106","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50106.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 10","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50107","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50107.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 11","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50108","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50108.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 12","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50109","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50109.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr50110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_50110.phy"}]}
