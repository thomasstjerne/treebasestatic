Here we present a molecular phylogeny of\nRacomitrium s.l. based on nuclear ITS and plastid rps4-trnL and\ntrnK/matK-psbA sequences, to test the monophyly of these four\nmorphological entities. Our results solely support the monophyly of\nRacomitrium s.str., which includes only R. geronticum, R. lanuginosum,\nand R. pruinosum, while the members of the other segregate genera are\ndistributed in different clades, rendering them polyphyletic\n(Bucklandiella, Codriophorus) or paraphyletic (Niphotrichum). Ancestral\nstate reconstruction shows high levels of homoplasy in the characters\nusually used for the infrageneric division of Racomitrium s.l. (i.e.,\nleaf papillae shape, perichaetial leaves morphology). Based on this\nevidence, we propose a return to a broader concept of Racomitrium, and\nadopt a revised sectional classification. Therefore, we propose new\ncombinations for some recently described species of Bucklandiella and\nCodriophorus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Racomitrium (Bryophytina: Grimmiaceae)\nML_tree_RAxML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_68522.phy"}]}
