Phalloideae, is\ndescribed from China with both multi-gene phylogenetic and morphological\ndata. This species occurs in subalpine coniferous forests in\nsouthwestern China and is characterized by its brownish pileus decorated\nwith conical to patch-like volval remnants, a slightly striate pileal\nmargin, a marginate basal bulb, and weakly amyloid to amyloid,\nsubglobose to broadly ellipsoid basidiospores measuring 9.511 × 89.5 μm.\nPhylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region,\nthe nuclear ribosomal RNA large subunit (nrLSU), the gene for the\npolymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) and for translation\nelongation factor 1-α (TEF1α) indicate A. chuformis is close to A.\npseudogemmata and A. levistriata. The new species is described,\nillustrated and compared with closely related and similar species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_132854.phy"}]}
