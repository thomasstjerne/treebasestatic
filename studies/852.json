In an effort to resolve this conflict, we\nsequenced fragments of the large and small subunit nuclear ribosomal\nRNAs (1078 nt; D1, D3, V4–5), the nuclear elongation factor 1{alpha}\ngene (EF-1α; 1098 nt), and a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome\noxidase I (COI; 411 nt). Seventy adult and larval morphological\ncharacters were reanalyzed and added to molecular data in a combined\nanalysis. We evaluated signal and homoplasy in each of the molecular\ndatasets and attempted to rank the particular datasets according to how\nappropriate they were for inferring relationships among suborders. This\nevaluation included testing for conflict among datasets, comparing tree\nlengths among alternative hypotheses, measuring the left-skew of\ntree-length distributions from maximally divergent sets of taxa,\nevaluating the recovery of expected clades, visualizing whether or not\nsubstitutions were accumulating with time, and estimating nucleotide\ncompositional bias.; Although all these measures cast doubt on the\nreliability of the deep-level signal coming from the nucleotides of the\nCOI and EF-1α genes, these data could still be included in combined\nanalyses without overturning the results from the most conservative\nmarker, the rRNA. The different datasets were found to be evolving under\nextremely different rates.; A site-specific likelihood method for\ndealing with combined data with nonoverlapping parameters was proposed,\nand a similar weighting scheme under parsimony was evaluated.; Among our\nphylogenetic conclusions, we found Annulipalpia to be the most basal of\nthe three suborders, with Spicipalpia and Integripalpia forming a clade.\nMonophyly of Annulipalpia and Integripalpia was confirmed, but the\nrelationships among spicipalpians remain equivocal.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5683.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a equally wted","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8a","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8b","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 8c","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9a","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 9b","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5689.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI equally wted","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Caddisflies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5690.phy"}]}
