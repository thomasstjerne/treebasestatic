The majority of\nthe samples resulted positive to phytoplasmas enclosed in the ribosomal\nsubgroup 16SrI-F, for the first time detected in potato and in the\nAmerican continent. Further studies will allow verification of the\ntransmission and further presence in Ecuador of this phytoplasma\nassociated with a purple top disease of potatoes","trees":[{"tree_label":"Ecuador-potatoes ML Tree","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr108194","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_108194.phy"}]}
