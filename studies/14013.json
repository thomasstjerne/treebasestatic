Multigene analyses based on the translation elongation factor\n1-alpha encoding gene (tef1), a part of the rpb2 gene, encoding the\nsecond largest RNA polymerase subunit and the larger subunit of ATP\ncitrate lyase (acl1) reveals thirteen phylogenetic species with little\nor no phenotypic differentiation. Acl1 is used here for the first time\nin Trichoderma phylogenetics. The typification of T. viridescens sensu\nstricto is clarified and Hypocrea viridescens is replaced by the new\nname T. paraviridescens. Besides these two species, eleven are\nphylogenetically recognized and Trichoderma olivascens, T. viridarium,\nT. virilente, T. trixiae, T. viridialbum, T. appalachiense, T.\nneosinense, T. composticola, T. nothescens and T. sempervirentis are\nformally described and illustrated. Several species produce yellow\ndiffusing pigment on CMD, particularly after storage at 15 Â°C, while T.\nolivascens is characterized by the formation of an olivaceous pigment.\nThe results are compared with earlier publications on this group of\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Disentangling the Trichoderma viridescens complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62022.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Disentangling the Trichoderma viridescens complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_62023.phy"}]}
