The new\ntaxon, Shanweiniao cooperorum, possesses several enantiornithine\nsynapomorphies as well as the elongate rostral morphology (rostrum equal\nto or exceeding 60% the total length of the skull) of the Chinese early\nCretaceous enantiornithines, Longipteryx chaoyangensis and\nLongirostravis hani. The discovery of this new specimen highlights the\nexistence of a diverse clade of trophically specialized\nenantiornithines, Longipterygidae, for which we present phylogenetic\nsupport in a new comprehensive cladistic analysis of Mesozoic birds.\nShanweiniao provides new information on the anatomy of longipterygids,\nand preserves a rectricial morphology previously unknown to\nenantiornithines, with at least four tail feathers closely arranged.\nThis supports the hypothesis that enantiornithines were strong fliers\nand adds to the diversity of known tail morphologies of these Cretaceous\nbirds.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 8","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55933.phy"}]}
