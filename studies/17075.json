During the course of a nationwide monitoring program aimed\nat the detection of pathogens in commercial eucalypt plantations, Q.\neucalypti was found affecting Eucalyptus globulus in Portugal. The\nidentity of the pathogen was confirmed by sequence analyses of the\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA operon, as well as\nmorphological characteristics. The results showed that Q. eucalypti is\nwidespread throughout the eucalypt producing areas of the country.\nPathogenicity studies revealed that different genotypes showed various\ndegrees of susceptibility to the pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst report of Q. eucalypti on Eucalyptus spp. in Portugal and in the\nNorthern hemisphere","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85323.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr85356","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_85356.phy"}]}
