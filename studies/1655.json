The ribosomal internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) of Bremia lactucae isolates was analyzed for\nthe first time. The ITS region of lettuce downy mildew was observed to\nhave a size of 2458 bp; thereby, having one of the longest ITS sizes\nrecorded to date. The majority of the extremely large sized ITS2 length\nof 2086 was attributed to the additional presences of nine repetitive\nelements with lengths of 179-194 bp, which between them shared the low\nhomology of 48-69 %. Comparison of the ITS2 sequences with the B.\nlactucae isolates from other host plants showed that isolates present on\nLactuca sativa were distinct from those on L. indica var. laciniata, as\nwell as Hemistepta and Youngia. We suggest the high degree of sequence\nheterogeneity exhibited in the ITS2 region of B. lactucae may warrant\nthe specific detection and diagnosis of this destructive pathogen or its\ndivision into several distinct species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bremia lactucae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2592.phy"}]}
