Here we describe four new species\nof purple pouch Cortinarius: Cortinarius diaphorus, C. minorisporus, C.\nostradsignatos, C. purpureocapitatus. These new species are associated\nwith Nothofagus spp. and have very similar morphology to C.\nporphyroideus, but are phylogenetically distinct based on the ITS and\nLSU region. In addition, based on molecular evidence, Thaxterogaster\nviola is synonymised with C. porphyroideus and C. violaceovolvatus is\ntransferred C. porphyroideus var. violaceovolvatus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115859","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115859.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115860","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115860.phy"}]}
