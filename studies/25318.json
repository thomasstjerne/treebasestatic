In this study, we add key\ntaxa to a previously generated dataset to produce a more inclusive\nphylogenetic analysis of the genus. The resulting nuclear ITS and\nplastid trnL-F phylogenies reveal that the historical sectional\nclassifications based on morphology are not supported. Instead, it\nappears that widespread morphological parallelism has occurred\nthroughout Korthalsella. Geographical distribution seems to be a better\nindicator of phylogenetic relatedness as species found in the same\ngeographic region, island or island group generally are more closely\nrelated to one another than species sharing similar morphological\ncharacters in other areas. We find greater support for recognition of\nspecies as local endemics rather than wide-ranging taxa. Given these\nresults, taxonomic changes that recognize previously described taxa are\nproposed, but other changes will require further study of broadly\ndistributed taxa","trees":[{"tree_label":"MajRul","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Korthalsella ITS trnL-F Bayesian majority rule","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_120441.phy"}]}
