This is the element which is unique to theropods and is\nimportant for understanding the link between birds and other theropods.\nNew specimens from basal theropods suggest that the furcula appeared\nvery early in theropod history. We review furcula development, function,\nand morphology, as well as the anatomical terminology applied to it.\nFurcular morphology is highly variable in crown-group avians but is\nrather conserved among nonavian theropods. Here we review, or describe\nfor the first time, the furculae in many nonavian theropods. Furculae\noccur in nearly all major clades of theropods, as shown by new theropod\nspecimens from the Early Cretaceous of China and a close inspection of\npreviously collected specimens. Informative phylogenetic characters\npertaining to the furcula occur throughout Theropoda, though care should\nbetake to consider taphonomic effects when describing furcular\nmorphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 7","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paraves phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55928.phy"}]}
