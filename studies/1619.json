Frequent and successive amplifications over evolutionary\ntime are important requirements for utilizing their presence or absence\nas landmarks of evolution. Although transposed elements are well\ndistributed in rodent taxa, the generally high degree of genomic\nsequence divergence among species complicates our access to\npresence/absence data. With this in mind we developed a novel, high\nthroughput computational strategy, called CPAL (Conserved\nPresence/Absence Locus finder), to identify genome-wide distributed,\nphylogenetically informative transposed elements flanked by highly\nconserved regions. From a total of 232 extracted chromosomal mouse loci\nwe randomly selected 14 of these plus 2 others from previous test\nscreens and attempted to amplify them via PCR in representative rodent\nspecies. All loci were amplifiable and ultimately contributed 31\nphylogenetically informative markers distributed throughout the major\ngroups of Rodentia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S-1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rodents","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_734.phy"}]}
