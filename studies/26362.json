Up to now, 1626 species in\n644 genera of fungi have been reported from caves and mines worldwide.\nIn this study, we investigated the mycobiota in karst caves in Southwest\nChina. In total, 251 samples from thirteen caves were collected and 2344\nfungal strains were obtained using dilution plate method. Preliminary\nITS analyses showed that these strains belonged to 610 species in 253\ngenera. Among these species, 88.0 % belonged to Ascomycota, 8.0 %\nBasidiomycota, 1.9 % Mortierellomycota, 1.9 % Mucoromycota, and 0.2 %\nGlomeromycota. The majority of these species have been previously known\nfrom other environments, and some of them are known as mycorrhizal or\npathogenic fungi. About 52.8% of these species were discovered for the\nfirst time from karst caves. Based on morphological and phylogenetic\ndistinctions, 33 new species were identified and described in this\npaper. Meanwhile, one new genus of Cordycipitaceae, Gamszarea, and five\nnew combinations are established. This work further demonstrated that\nKarst caves encompass a high fungal diversity, including a number of\npreviously unknown species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126217","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126217.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 15","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126219","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126219.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 23","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126220","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126220.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126216","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126216.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126215","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126215.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 26","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126222","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126222.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 31","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126223","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126223.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 25","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126221","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126221.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 34","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126224.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 37","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126225.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 47","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126226.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 13","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126218","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126218.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 49","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126227.phy"}]}
