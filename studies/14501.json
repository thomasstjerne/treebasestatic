{"Authors":" Mariana Del Olmo-Ruiz, Anne Elizabeth Arnold","Year":" 2013","Title":" Interannual variation and host affiliations of endophytic\nfungi associated with ferns at La Selva, Costa Rica","Journal":" Mycologia","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Ascomycota, diversity, fungal endophytes, host\naffiliation, tropical forest","DOI":"","Abstract":" Ferns are an ancient and diverse lineage of vascular\nplants that differ morphologically, chemically, and in growth habits\nfrom the angiosperms with which they co-occur. We used a culture-based\napproach coupled with phylogenetic analyses to characterize the\nincidence, diversity, and composition of fungal endophyte assemblages in\nferns, with a special focus on healthy above-ground tissues of seven\nspecies of eupolypods at La Selva, Costa Rica. Endophytes were isolated\nfrom every individual plant and were similarly abundant and diverse in\nfrond blades and stalks, in different vegetation types, in epiphytic\nvs.Â terrestrial species, and between sampling years. However, abundance,\ndiversity, and community structure differed significantly among fern\nspecies, and composition differed markedly between sampling years.\nPhylogenetic classification using separate and combined datasets\nrevealed that as for many neotropical angiosperms, the majority (95%) of\nendophyte taxa were Ascomycota, with particular dominance by\nSordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes. However, our data\nsuggest higher phylogenetic richness and stronger host affinities in\nfern associated endophytes relative to those studied in angiosperms thus\nfar.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50
