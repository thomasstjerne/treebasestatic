On the other hand, there are allied\ngenera having macro- and microscopic characters similar to those of\nPolyporus. The phylogenetic relationships of Polyporus and allied genera\nwere established from sequences of RNA polymerase II second largest\nsubunit (RPB2), nuclear ribosomal large subunit (nucLSU), and\nmitochondrial ATPase subunit 6 (ATP6). The molecular phylogenetic trees\nconfirmed that Polyporus is a polyphyletic genus and recognized six\nmajor clades (Clades 1-6) containing species of Polyporus and several\nallied genera. Among the detected six clades, Clade 1 contained three\ninfrageneric groups of Polyporus and two allied genera, Datronia and\nPseudofavolus, while Clade 6 contained Group Polyporellus and Lentinus.\nOn the other hand, five of the six major clades contained species\nbelonging to a single infrageneric group, Favolus, Melanopus,\nPolyporellus or Polyporus. These results suggest that the morphological\ncharacters used to define these groups have phylogenetic significance\nand revealed the need for a taxonomic revision of Polyporus and its\nallied genera.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5232.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5233.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5234.phy"},{"tree_label":"nucLSU Bayes","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5235.phy"}]}
