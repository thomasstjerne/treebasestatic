These geckos are endemic to\nMadagascar and the Comores and are popularly kept and bred by\nherpetoculturalists. The closest relative of Paroedura is another Indian\nOcean leaf-toed gecko, Ebenavia. Both Bayesian inference and maximum\nparsimony strongly support the monophyly of two major clades within\nParoedura that conflict with existing species group assignments based on\nscale characteristics. Our well-resolved tree elucidates a biogeographic\npattern in which eastern Paroedura are most basal and western and\nsouth-western species form a monophyletic group. Our data demonstrate\nthe phylogenetic utility of phosducin, a novel marker in squamate\nphylogenetics, at the intrageneric level.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"The Malagasy-Comoran gecko Paroedura","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4974.phy"}]}
