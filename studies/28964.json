The current study conducted in the\nsubalpine region of Uzbekistan discovered a new species on a dead stem\nof wild rose. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined LSU,\nSSU, ITS, and TEF 1-ɑ dataset confirmed the new species’ taxonomic\nposition in Laburnicola. Our new species, Laburnicola zaaminensis (TASM\n6152), was clustered with L. dactylidis (MFLUCC 16-0285) with strong\nbootstrap support. A detailed description together with illustrations\nare provided for Laburnicola zaaminensis. Furthermore, an annotated\nspecies list, a distribution map, and a taxonomic key for Laburnicola\nspecies are provided. This is the first record of Laburnicola from\nCentral Asia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134343","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134343.phy"}]}
