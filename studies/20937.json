The lack of type\nisolates and thorough phylogenetic studies in the Microascaceae hampered\nthe correct identification of these isolates. Based on recent\nphylogenetic studies, which resulted in multiple name changes, the aim\nis to molecularly identify the Scopulariopsis and scopulariopsis-like\nspecies which occur in the indoor environment and give an overview of\nthe current species in these genera and their habitats. Strains from the\nCBS culture collection were supplemented with almost 80 indoor strains\nof which the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 and intervening 5.8S\nnrDNA (ITS), beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor\n1-alpha (tef1) gene regions were sequenced for phylogenetic inference.\nThe multi-gene phylogenies recognise 33 Microascus species and 12\nScopulariopsis species and showed that the recently established genus\nFuscoannellis, typified by Scopulariopsis carbonaria, should be\nsynonymized with the genus Yunnania. Seven new Microascus species, four\nnew Scopulariopsis species, and one new Yunnania species, are described,\nand a new name in Microascus and two new name combinations (one in\nMicroascus, and one in Yunnania) are proposed. In the indoor environment\n14 Microascus species and three Scopulariopsis species were found.\nScopulariopsis brevicaulis (22 indoor isolates) and Microascus\nmelanosporus (19 indoor isolates) are the most common indoor species, in\nnumber of isolates, followed by M. paisii (8 indoor isolates) and S.\ncandida (7 indoor isolates). A genus phylogeny based on the ITS, tef1\nand the large subunit 28S nrDNA (LSU) of the type or representative\nisolates of all here recognised species is provided depicting all\nspecies habitats. No correlation between phylogenetic relationship and\nhabitat preference could be observed. Ten species which are found indoor\nare also found in relation with human-derived samples. A table showing\nrecent name changes and a key to common species of Scopulariopsis and\nscopulariopsis-like genera found indoors is included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Micro_MrBayes_ITS","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103971","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103971.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_RAxML_combined","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103972","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103972.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_Mrbayes_tef1","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103973","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103973.phy"},{"tree_label":"genera_RAxML","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scopulariopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103914.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes_genera","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103915.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_MrBayes_ITS","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103916","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103916.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_MrBayes_tef","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103917","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103917.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_MrBayes_tub2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103918","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103918.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_RAxML_tef1","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103920","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103920.phy"},{"tree_label":"SCOP_RAxML_tub2","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103921","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103921.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_MrBayes_combined","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103922","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_RAxML_combined","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103923","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103923.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_RAxML_ITS","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scopulariopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103968.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_MrBayes_tub2","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103966","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103966.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_MrBayes_combined","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103967","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103967.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micr_RAxML_tef1","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103969","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103969.phy"},{"tree_label":"Micro_RAxML_tub2","ntax":"157","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103970","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103970.phy"},{"tree_label":"Scop_RAxML_ITS","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103919","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103919.phy"}]}
