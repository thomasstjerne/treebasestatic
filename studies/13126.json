A new theropod from the earliest Late\nJurassic of western China represents the earliest diverging member of\nthe enigmatic theropod group Alvarezsauroidea and confirms that this\ngroup is a basal member of Maniraptora, the clade containing birds and\ntheir closest theropod relatives. It extends the fossil record of\nAlvarezsauroidea by 63 million years and provides evidence for\nmaniraptorans earlier in the fossil record than Archaeopteryx. The new\ntaxon confirms extreme morphological convergence between birds and\nderived alvarezsauroids and illuminates incipient stages of the highly\nmodified alvarezsaurid forelimb.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"99","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alvarezsauroidea phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55552.phy"}]}
