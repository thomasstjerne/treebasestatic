We examine these ideas using a new dataset on maximum\nlongevity, ecology, and life history of 162 parrot species (Order:\nPsittaciformes). Parrots are generally long-lived but exhibit remarkable\nvariation in life span between similar-sized genera, with particularly\nlong-lived species occurring in the Cacatua, Calyptorhynchus, and\nAmazona genera. After controlling for both body size and phylogenetic\nancestry using a phylogenetic supertree of all 352 parrot species, type\nof diet and communal roosting explain significant variation in parrot\nlife span. The influence of communal roosting on longevity is\nstatistically dependent on an association with diet type. We suggest\nthat extreme longevity in parrots has evolved in response to\nspecies-specific characteristics of diet, habitat, and behavior that\ninfluence extrinsic mortality rates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cacatuidae","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cacatuidae, Ratchet","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2036.phy"},{"tree_label":"New World","ntax":"148","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psittaciformes, New World Ratchet","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4443.phy"},{"tree_label":"Old World","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psittaciformes, Old World ratchet","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4444.phy"},{"tree_label":"Loriidae","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Loriidae, Ratchet","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4445.phy"}]}
