The population approach\ncombines functional, comparative, and genetic studies aimed at\nunderstanding the environmental selection pressures that have favored\nthe evolution of the complex. The phylogenetic approach uses estimates\nof genealogical relationships between species to truce the historical\nsequence of changes leading to the diversity of modern forms. A major\nconcern is how intrinsic structural features of ancestral species\ndirected subsequent evolutionary pattern. The two approaches are more\ncomplementary than antagonistic, and I illustrate how a greater\nsynthesis of the two viewpoints can yield insights into evolutionary\nevents. The benefits of a joint approach are especially evident in\ncomparative study. where presentday differences between taxa can be\npartitioned into components. one representing the effects of the current\nenvironment and another of prior history. I give examples of studies of\nadaptation that have benefited from a phylogenetic perspective. I also\nshow how population models of natural selection can be valuable in the\ninterpretation of historical events and may he useful in the\nconstruction of phylogenies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Galapagos finches","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3237.phy"}]}
