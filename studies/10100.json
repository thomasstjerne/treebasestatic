In this study, the culture characteristics\nwithin Phyllosticta s. str. were examined and phylogenetic relationships\namong Japanese species of Phyllosticta s. str. and its teleomorph\nGuignardia were analyzed using 18S rDNA sequences. Phyllosticta s. str.\nformed a monophyletic clade. ITS-28S rDNA sequences extracted from\nfungal cultures derived from various host plants were divided into two\nsub groups. The first group included cultures from a wide range of host\nplants and were mainly derived as endophytes from symptomless plant. In\nthe second group, cultures from each host plant genus formed distinct\nclades. These were often isolated as leaf pathogens from diverse plants.\nIsolates belonging to the first lineage generally grew faster on oat\nmeal agar. To classify species of Phyllosticta it is necessary to\nconsider an integrated approach such as molecular phylogeny, host plant,\ncolony growth, symptoms and morphological characteristics of the\nconidiomata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta s. s.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6211.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"93","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta s. l.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6081.phy"}]}
