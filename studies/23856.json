Most collections of\nthese three species were made from Taiwan and a few specimens were\ncollected from mainland China. Taxonomic status of the new genus and new\nspecies were supported by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences\ninferred from a combined dataset of nuc rDNA 28S+5.8S genetic markers,\nand a nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (ITS) dataset. Bayesian, Maximum\nLikelihood and Maximum Parsimony algorithms were used to construct\nphylogenies of these two set of analyses. Basidiomes of Albocorticium\nspp. are resupinate, effused; hymenial surface white or whitish cream,\nsmooth, minutely or strongly cracked; hyphal system is monomitic with\nclamped hyphae, oily secreted material usually distributed in subiculum\nand hymenial layer, cystidia are lacking while hyphidia are present,\nclavate basidia, sterigmata fairly stout and rigid when young,\nthin-walled basidiospores usually have a fairly prominent apiculus; all\nmicroscopical elements are inamlyloid. These three new species can be\ndistinguished by having different basidiospore dimensions.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115593","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115593.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115592","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115592.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118906","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118906.phy"},{"tree_label":"con all compat","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118907","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118907.phy"}]}
