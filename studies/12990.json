The specimen is identified as\nenantiornithine by the convex scapular facet, approximate alignment of\nthis facet with the humeral articular facet and acrocoracoid process,\nand the presence of an acrocoracoidal tubercle. This coracoid came from\na comparatively large individual, consistent with previous reports of\nother large enantiornithines from strata of Campanian strata in North\nAmerica, South America, and Europe. The occurrence of enantionithines in\nthe Kaiparowits Formation and their apparent absence in the well-sampled\nDinosaur Park Formation of similar age in Alberta represents yet another\nfaunal difference between the two areas, although this may be a result\nof environmental differences rather than the endemism proposed for\nnon-avian dinosaurs.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. S1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aves Pylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55083.phy"}]}
