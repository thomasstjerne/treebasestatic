Erysiphe azerbaijanica is distinguished from other\nErysiphe species occuring on Castanea spp. by its cylindrical conidia\nwith a length/width ratio of 2Â–3.6, longer conidiophore, and foot- cells.\nMolecular analyses indicated that this species forms a clade of its own,\nsupporting the morphological observations. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses showed that E. blasti s. lat. is divided into two genetically\ndifferentiated groups associated with different host species. Based on\nthe sequence differences in the 28S rDNA gene and ITS region, connected\nwith differences in the number and length of appendages, the fungus on\nL. praecox is described as a new species, E. linderae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Erysiphe azerbaijanica and E. linderae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111737.phy"}]}
