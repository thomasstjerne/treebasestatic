A second species,\nMetaxya lanosa, was described in 2001 on the basis of morphological\nfeatures and rbcL gene sequences with a suggestion that the genus may\ncontain even more species. We have now systematically compared\nmorphological traits in a large number of Metaxya specimens collected in\ntropical America. We have also carried out phylogenetic analyses of 32\nMetaxya and 5 outgroup specimens based on four markers of the plastid\ngenome (rbcL, matK, and rps4 genes, and trnG-trnR intergenic spacer).\nBased on the morphological variation among the Metaxya specimens, we\naccept six distinct species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses resolved\nfive distinct clades. Four of these corresponded with the\nmorphologically delineated species (M. contamanensis sp. nov., M.\nelongata sp. nov., M. lanosa, and M. parkeri) and the fifth clade\ncontained all the individuals of the remaining two species. Metaxya\nrostrata was rendered paraphyletic by M. scalaris sp. nov. being nested\nwithin it. Since M. scalaris was resolved as monophyletic, and the two\nare clearly distinguishable morphologically, we consider them true\nspecies despite the lack of clear genetic differentiation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"POY 0111","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86566","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86566.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayesian tree","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Metaxya","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_86564.phy"},{"tree_label":"POY 0221","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86568","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86568.phy"},{"tree_label":"POY 3111","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86569","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86569.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86565","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86565.phy"},{"tree_label":"POY 0211","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86567.phy"},{"tree_label":"POY 3211","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86570","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86570.phy"},{"tree_label":"POY 3221","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr86571","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_86571.phy"}]}
