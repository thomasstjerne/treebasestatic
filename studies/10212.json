Nuclear DNA sequences can\nprovide valuable information for identifying polyploid origins; however,\nremarkably few nuclear markers have been developed specifically for\nferns, and previously published primer sets are far from universal. In\nthis study, we present new primer sequences for the amplification of a\nportion of the nuclear gapCp gene. Through a broad survey across ferns,\nwe demonstrate that these primers are nearly universal for this clade.\nWith a case study in cheilanthoids, we show that this rapidly evolving\nmarker is a powerful tool for discriminating between autopolyploids and\nallopolyploids. Our results indicate that gapCp holds considerable\npotential for addressing species-level questions across the fern tree of\nlife.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyploid Fern Origins, part 2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6162.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Polyploid Fern Origins, part 1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6572.phy"}]}
