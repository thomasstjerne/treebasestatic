The species was\nfound from Tibet of southwest China, growing on angiosperm wood which\nare not much decayed. A. tibetica is characterized by an annual growth\nhabit, resupinate basidiocarps with buff-yellow to yellowish brown pores\n0.5Â–1.5 per mm, a dimitic hyphal system with generative hyphae bearing\nclamp connections and subicular skeletal hyphae encrusted with fine\ncrystals, abundant gloeocystidia variable in shape, and oblong-ellipsoid\nbasidiospores. The phylogenetic analysis based on ITS + nLSU rDNA\nsequences shows that the A. tibetica nested in Antella, forming a\nmonophyletic lineage with strong support (100% BS, 100% BP, 1.00 BPP).\nThe difference between A. tibetica and other members of the genus are\ndiscussed. A key to accepted species of Antella is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135411.phy"}]}
