The new\nspecies Lactarius cheilocystidiatus and L. polycystis are distinctive in\nL. subg. Plinthogalus due to the presence of real macrocystidia. They\nare closely related to Thai L. crassiusculus. Lactarius gloeocarpus and\nL. fagacicola are new members of L. subg. Lactarius, characterized by\nthe yellowish sticky pileus, reticulate spores and big macrocystidia.\nThey form a species complex with Chinese L. pallido-ochraceus and L.\npallidizonatus and Indian L. thindii. Lactarius hunanensis is a species\nwith strong temperate affinity. It is distinguished by the pileipellis\nan ixolattice with olivaceous incrustations and spores with zebroid\nornamentation. Lactarius austroscrobiculatus, a tropical species\noriginally described from Indonesia, is reported from China for the\nfirst time. Specimens studied are collected from Hunan, Anhui, Henan,\nJiangxi and Yunnan. Species reported in this study are representative\nfungi in the Sino-Japan forest subkingdom.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134759","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134759.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr134761","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_134761.phy"}]}
