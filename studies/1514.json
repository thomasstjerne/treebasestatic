Previously only recorded\nfrom deep-sea (1500 \u001a 3000 m) whale-falls in the north-east Pacific, this\nis the first species of Osedax known from a shelf-depth whale-fall, and\nthe first from the Atlantic Ocean. The new species, Osedax mucofloris\nsp. n., is abundant on the bones of an experimentally implanted Minke\nwhale carcass (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) at 125 m depth in the shallow\nNorth Sea. O. mucofloris can be cultured on bones maintained in aquaria.\nThe presence of O. mucofloris in the shallow North Sea and north-east\nPacific suggests global distribution on whale-falls for the Osedax\nclade. Molecular evidence from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1)\nand 18S rRNA sequences suggests that O. mucofloris has high dispersal\nrates, and provides support for the idea of whale-falls acting as\n\u001astepping-stones\u001a for the global dispersal of siboglinid annelids over\necological and evolutionary time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2a","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic position for Osedax mucofloris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2405.phy"}]}
