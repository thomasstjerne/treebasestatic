The small Andean genus Pentacyphus is\nsister to the MOG clade. The former Gonolobinae form a well-supported\nsubclade closely related to members of Tassadia, Funastrum, and the\nformer Oxypetalinae. The only genera that are monophyletic as presently\ncircumscribed are Tassadia and Funastrum. The separation of Tweedia from\nOxypetalum is justified by our results. Philibertia will be monophyletic\nif Amblystigma, Fontellaea, Melinia, Mitostigma, and Podandra are\nincluded. Most species of Blepharodon and Hemipogon are not monophyletic\nwith the respective type species. Some former Astephanus and Cynanchum\nspecies as well as the monotypic Grisebachiella are imbedded in\nDiplolepis (D. descolei, D. geminiflora, D. hieronymi, D.\nboerhaviifolia, and D. nummulariifolia). The neglected tribe Orthosieae\nis recognized at subtribal level, Orthosiinae. Chromosome numbers (as\nfar as known) show a tendency for reduction in several clades. The study\nsets a framework for future study of the American MOG genera and\nhighlights areas in need of further attention.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MOG","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1824.phy"}]}
