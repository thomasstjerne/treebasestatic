In Uruguay, there have been recent reports of paralytic\nrabies in cattle transmitted by the common vampire bat. We sequenced the\ncytochrome b gene of five bats from northern Uruguay. All five DNA\nsequences were identical and grouped with a southern Atlantic Forest\nclade, suggesting recent dispersal from nearby Brazil, as revealed in\nphylogeographic diffusion analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Desmodus rotundus cytb","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106502.phy"}]}
