Such disjunct distributions are,\nhowever, typically observed at the species level in bryophytes, whereas\nthey occur at much higher taxonomic level in angiosperms. The corollary\nof this observation is that morphological evolution in bryophytes is\nexceedingly slow. These hypotheses can now be explicitly tested with the\nadvent of molecular dating. In this paper, we show that the\ntrans-Atlantic disjunctions observed in the liverwort genus Leptoscyphus\ndate back to 5.5 Myr, thus largely post-dating the opening of the South\nAtlantic. The temporal calibration of the phylogeny allows us to\nestimate for the first time the absolute timing of morphological\nevolution in bryophytes. The time frame necessary for shifts to occur\nbetween character states was estimated on average at ca. 4.05 Â± 1.86\nMyr. As opposed to the traditional view that bryophyte evolution has\nbeen triggered by episodic shifts in habitat conditions, our analyses\nfurthermore suggest that morphological and molecular divergence\ngradually accumulated in the genus, in agreement with recent\nobservations of regular accumulation of diversity in tropical\nliverworts.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leptoscyphus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_376.phy"}]}
