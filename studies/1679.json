Data partitioning is important because, as long as the same\ntopology/history underlies all of the partitions, it addresses some of\nthe problems associated with the combination of data sets with\nheterogeneous rates and eliminates the need to argue the validity of\ntests that have been used to judge data combinability. In addition, new\nstudies indicate that data partitioning and the use of mixed models\noften dramatically improve the fit of model to data without the cost of\noverparameterization. While applying partitioned models to studies of\nprotein-coding mitochondrial data, we have found that analyses using\nMrBayes may infer overly „long‰ trees if among-partition rate variation\n(APRV) is not explicitly accommodated and if data from different\npartitions evolve at different average rates.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kikihia, APRV not accommodated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_330.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Kikihia, APRV accommodated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4687.phy"}]}
