Initially the authors tentatively concluded that the\npopulations exhibited panmixis, and suggested that local environmental\neffects accounted for the apparent morphological and behavioral\ndifferences. However, they later concluded that such differences were\ntoo great to be accounted for by the environment alone, and that the\nfour populations actually represented three different species. To\nconfirm that the allozyme results were, in fact, artifactual, we\nreexamined the relationships among these populations by sequencing a\nportion of the 12S mtDNA ribosomal subunit. In contrast to the allozyme\nresult, our results demonstrate good agreement between patterns of\ngenetic and morphological/behavioral variation. We suggest (1) that the\nallozyme allele frequencies are homogenized by balancing selection, not\ngene flow as was previously concluded, and therefore (2) that this study\nprovides another instance where inferences about population structures\nfrom allozyme data are misleading.
