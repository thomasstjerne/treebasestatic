The resulting genealogies were\ncompared with the species phylogeny derived from non-coding sequences.\nWe found conflicting topologies between the reproductive genealogies and\nthe species phylogeny, and these conflicts were supported by both node\nsupport analyses and likelihood tests on the relative fit of datasets to\nalternative phylogenetic hypotheses. We argue that reproductive genes\nare more permeable to gene flow, i.e. are more often introgressed\nbetween species of Neurospora, than other parts of the genome. Certain\nconflicts between species phylogeny and both mat genealogies were\nobserved, suggesting that the two mating-type idiomorphs were\nselectively introgressed into a species from a single ancestral source.\nTaken together, the results presented here highlight complex\nevolutionary trajectories of reproductive genes in the fungal kingdom,\nwhich may be of importance for reproductive behavior in natural\npopulations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20649.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20653.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20646.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20647.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20663.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20652.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20651.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20648.phy"},{"tree_label":"phyml","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Filamentous Ascomycete Genus Neurospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_20650.phy"}]}
