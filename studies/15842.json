However, is the plant a Synotis or a Parasenecio? We\nhave examined floral micromorphological and cytological characters of P.\nchenopodifolius, and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses based on\nITS and ETS sequence data. The anther collar of this taxon is\nbalusterform, and the endothecial tissue cell wall thickenings are\nradial. These conform to the floral microcharacters of Synotis but\ndiffer from those of Parasenecio, which has subcylindrical anther\ncollars, and polarized endothecial tissue cell wall thickenings.\nChromosomes counts indicate the taxon has 2n = 40, a number common in\nSynotis; Parasenecio has 2n = 60. Our phylogenetic analyses based on\nITS/ETS sequences also place P. chenopodifolius in Synotis. We propose\nthe new combination S. chenopodifolia and synonymize S. otophylla.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr75164","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_75164.phy"}]}
