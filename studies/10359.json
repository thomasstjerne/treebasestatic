Parsimony analyses included two aproaches: a) a\nmultiple-sequence alignment where gaps were treated as missing or coded,\nb) using direct sequences by direct optimization as implemented by POY.\nAnalyses under direct optimization were conducted using the molecular\ndatasets independently and combined, and with morphological data.\nDifferent cost regimes were explored and that producing the highest\ncongruence between partitions was chosen. Among the genera considered,\nonly Piptochaetium, Austrostipa, and Hesperostipa were resolved as\nmonophyletic, while Achnatherum, Amelichloa s.l., Anatherostipa, Jarava,\nand Nassella were polyphyletic, and Aciachne was polyphyletic or\nparaphyletic. As a result, Amelichloa can be restricted to a\nmonophyletic group if including A. brachychaeta, A. ambigua, A.\nclandestina, and A. caudata, or it should be considered within Nassella.\nThe phylogenetic position of species of Aciachne suggests inbreeding and\noutbreeding events with species of Anatherostipa, Ortachne and\nHesperostipa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, rpl16 tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7299.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, rpoA consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7300.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 c2","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, combined2 DNA+morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7303.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 c3","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, combined3 DNA+morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, trnLF consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7301.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, trnT-L consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7298.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5 c1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stipeae, combined1 DNA+morphology","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_7302.phy"}]}
