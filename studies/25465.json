The ascomycete C. paspali is\nknown to be the pathogen responsible for this disease in both grasses.\nThis fungus produces alkaloids, including ergot alkaloids and\nindole-diterpenes, that have potent neurotropic activities in mammals. A\ntotal of 32 isolates from Uruguay were obtained from infected P.\ndilatatum and P. plicatulum. Isolates were phylogenetically identified\nusing partial sequences of the genes coding for the second largest\nsubunit of RNA polymerase subunit II (RPB2), translation elongation\nfactor 1-α (TEF1), β-tubulin (TUB2), and the nuc rDNA 28S subunit (28S).\nIsolates were also genotyped by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA\n(RAPD) and presence of genes within the ergot alkaloid (EAS) and\nindole-diterpene (IDT) biosynthetic gene clusters. This study represents\nthe first genetic characterization of several isolates of C. paspali.\nThe results from this study provide insight into the genetic and\ngenotypic diversity of Claviceps paspali present in P. dilatatum and\nsuggest that isolates from P. plicatulum could be considered an\necological subspecies or specialized variant of C. paspali. Some of\nthese isolates show hypothetical alkaloid genotypes never reported\nbefore.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps paspali","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121017.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121018","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121018.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps paspali","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121010.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121016.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121019","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_121019.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Claviceps paspali","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121020.phy"}]}
