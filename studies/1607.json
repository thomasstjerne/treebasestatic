Host-parasite co-speciation was reported recently between\nthe genus Golovinomyces and Asteraceae from molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses. The Asteraceae originated in South America and latterly\nexpanded their geographic distribution into the Northern Hemisphere. If\nthe co-speciation between Golovinomyces and Asteraceae originated in\nSouth America, the geographic origin of Golovinomyces could be assumed\nto be South America. To address this question, Golovinomyces species\nfrom hosts of the tribe Mutisieae, an asteraceous tribe endemic to South\nAmerica, were collected and sequenced. Results indicate that Oidium\nmutisiae and Golovinomyces leuceriae isolated from the Mutisieae do not\nbelong at the base of the Golovinomyces tree. Instead, they are situated\nseparately within two different clades of Golovinomyces isolates from\nthe Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the tribe Mutisieae is not the most\nearly host of Golovinomyces. Present results suggest that Golovinomyces\noriginated in the Northern Hemisphere, and not in South America. The new\nspecies Oidium reginae for the previous O. mutisiae on Mutisia decurrens\nis proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Golovinomyces ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_712.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Golovinomyces 28S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_713.phy"}]}
