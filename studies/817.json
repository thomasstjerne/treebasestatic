New sequences of these\nregions from 18 species were aligned to the sequences of Aureobasidium\nxx obtained from Genbank and those of two representatives of\nPezizomycetes used as outgroup. A combined data set of SSU and LSU rDNA\nwas analysed using minimum evolution and maximum likelihood. The\npseudoparaphysate taxa (Pleosporales incl. Melanommatales) form a\nmonophyletic group. A separation of Melanommatales can be rejected using\nparametric bootstrapping and this supports previous results obtained\nfrom SSU rDNA studies. The aparaphysate loculoascomycetes form a\nsister-group to the Pleosporales, but this grouping has no bootstrap\nsupport. Within the aparaphysate species, two well-supported groups can\nbe distinguished, the Dothideales s.str. and the Capnodiales with\nMyriangiales. The Myriangiales appear paraphyletic, but this has only\npoor bootstrap support. A monophyly of Dothideales incl. Capnodiales can\nbe rejected with parametric bootstrapping, as well as a subdivision of\nthe loculoascomycetes based on form and opening of the ascomata and\nascus. The phylogeny of the aparaphysate taxa requires further\nstudies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1201.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dothideomycetes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1200.phy"}]}
