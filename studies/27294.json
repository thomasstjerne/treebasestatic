Morphological\nstudies along with a molecular phylogeny based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) of ribosomal DNA\nrevealed two new species in this family from soils in China,\ni.e.Â Absidia ovalispora sp. nov. and Cunninghamella globospora sp. nov.\nThe former is phylogenetically closely related to A. koreana, but\nmorphologically differs in sporangiospores, sporangia, sporangiophores,\napophyses, columellae, collars and rhizoids. The latter is\nphylogenetically closely related to C. intermedia, but morphologically\ndiffers in sporangiola and colonies. They were described and\nillustrated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr127506","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_127506.phy"}]}
