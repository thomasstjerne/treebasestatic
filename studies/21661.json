In the present study, a large collection of\nSeiridium cultures and specimens from the CBS and IMI collections was\ninvestigated morphologically and phylogenetically to resolve the\ntaxonomy of the genus. These investigations included the type material\nof the most important Cupressaceae pathogens, Seiridium cardinale, S.\ncupressi and S. unicorne. We constructed a phylogeny of Seiridium based\non four loci, namely the ITS rDNA region, and partial gene sequences of\nthe translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF), Î²-tubulin (TUB) and RNA\nPolymerase II subunit 2 (RPB2). Based on these results we were able to\nphylogenetically delineate S. unicorne and S. cupressi. In addition,\nfive novel species were described and an epitype designated for\nSeiridium eucalypti.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1++","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seiridium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110809.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seiridium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110811.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110810","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110810.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Seiridium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_110813.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1+","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr110812","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_110812.phy"}]}
