This Asian branch of the family has coevolved with such\nhuman trematode parasites as Schistosoma and Paragonimus; it is ideally\nsuitable for studying patterns and processes of evolution over 100\nmillion years. Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences are used\nhere to elucidate taxonomic relationships from the subspecies to\nfamilial level. In Chinese literature, pomatiopsid taxa have been\nclassified in the Hydrobiidae; what are the genetic relationships\nbetween Hydrobia and allied taxa classified as pomatiopsid? Sixteen\nsequences, ranging in length from 578 to 645 nucleotides, are aligned\nfrom 11 species of nine genera assigned to seven families, four of which\nare rissoacean. Five different phylogenetic analyses are concordant: (1)\nthe pomatiopsid taxa are in one distinct clade, the other rissoaceans\nform a second ciade; (2) truncatellids are more closely allied to the\nhydrobiids than to the pomatiopsids; (3) the rissoid Setia is part of\nthe truncatellid-hydrobiid clade; (4) two subspecies of Oncomelania are\nclearly divergent; (5) triculine taxa appear divergent from pomatiopsine\ntaxa. However, the Tricula sp. node is weakly supported. Individuals of\na population differ by an average of 0.005 +- 0.004 nucleotide\ndifferences/site; the subspecies of Oncomelania differ by 0.148 +-\n0.004; the two species of Hydrobia differ by 0.162 (range of 0.161 -\n0.163); the triculine genera Tricula and Gammatricula differ by 0.132\n(range of 0.130 - 0.133); the pomatiopsid subfamilies Pomatiopsinae and\nTriculinae differ by 0.179 +- 0.020; the families Hydrobiidae and\nPomatiopsidae differ by 0.267 +- 0.016. Non-rissoacean and rissoacean\ntaxa differ by 0.274 +- 0.023.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rissoaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3491.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rissoaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3492.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rissoaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3493.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rissoaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3494.phy"}]}
