From\nspecimens of Sticta collected during field trips in typical cerrado\nvegetation of Central Brazil, two new species were found, Sticta\nbitomentosa and S. porella; and they are described in detail in this\nstudy, including morphological, anatomical, and molecular analyses based\non the nuITS region. The two new taxa belong to one of the major Sticta\nclades, which contains mostly New World species. This work shows that\nthe cerrado, a global biodiversity hotspot located in the center of\nSouth America, could contain a great diversity of new species of\nlichenized fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129328","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129328.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"233","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr129327","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_129327.phy"}]}
