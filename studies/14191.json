Inferring such phylogenies for non-model organisms is challenging\ngiven limited resources for whole-genome sequencing. We take advantage\nof genomic data from a single species to test the limits of\nhybridization-based enrichment of hundreds of exons across frog species\nthat diverged up to 250 million years ago. Enrichment success for a\ngiven species depends greatly on the divergence time between it and the\nreference species, and the resulting alignment contains a significant\nproportion of missing data. However, our alignment generates a\nwell-supported phylogeny of frogs, suggesting this technique is a\npractical solution towards resolving relationships across deep\nevolutionary time.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Anura no missing","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63304","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63304.phy"},{"tree_label":"Anura full matrix","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63306","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63306.phy"}]}
