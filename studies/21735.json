According\nto our morphological observations, reference isolates of strawberry and\nJapanese pear pathotypes, which are toxic to leaves of Japanese pear\n‘Nijisseiki’, have conidia that are formed in chains of 313, usually\nwithout lateral branches, after 7 d incubation on potato-carrot agar.\nThe mean size of the conidia is 2731 × 1113 μm. Morphological\ncharacteristics of the examined isolates are identical to those of A.\ngaisen rather than A. alternata. A phylogenetic tree obtained by\nanalysis of a combined dataset of ITS, gapdh, rpb2, tef1, Alt a 1, and\nendoPG sequences also strongly supports both pathotypes as one species,\nA. gaisen. We re-describe the fungus as A. gaisen Nagano ex Bokura and\npropose two formae speciales of the species, A. gaisen f. sp. fragariae\nproducing AF-toxin and f. sp. pyri producing AK-toxin. The epitype\nspecimen and ex-epitype culture of A. gaisen are newly designated.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr107597","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107597.phy"}]}
