However, the molecular\nmechanisms for Al detoxification and accumulation are still poorly\nunderstood. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis of Al tolerance\nand accumulation, we used the Illumina high-throughput mRNA sequencing\n(RNA-seq) technology to conduct a genome-wide transcriptome analysis on\nboth tip and basal segments of the roots exposed to Al. Results By using\nthe Trinity method for the de novo assembly and cap3 software to reduce\nthe redundancy and chimeras of the transcripts, we constructed 39,815\ntranscripts with an average length of 1184 bp, among which 20,605\ntranscripts were annotated by BLAST searches in the NCBI non-redundant\nprotein database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and\nGenomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that genes involved in the\ndefense of cell wall toxicity and oxidative stress were preferentially\ninduced in expression by Al stress. Our RNA-seq data also revealed that\norganic acid metabolism was unlikely to be a rate-limiting step for the\nAl-induced secretion of organic acids in buckwheat. We identified two\ncitrate transporter genes that were highly induced by Al and potentially\ninvolved in the release of citrate into the xylem. In addition, three of\nfour conserved Al-tolerance genes were found to be duplicated in tartary\nbuckwheat and display diverse expression patterns. Conclusions Nearly\n40,000 high quality transcript contigs were de novo assembled for\ntartary buckwheat, providing a reference platform for future research\nwork in this plant species. Our differential expression and phylogenetic\nanalysis revealed novel aspects of Al-tolerant mechanisms in\nbuckwheat.","trees":[{"tree_label":"STAR2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fagopyrum STAR2","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79950.phy"},{"tree_label":"STAR1","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fagopyrum STAR1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79951.phy"},{"tree_label":"ALS1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fagopyrum ALS1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79953.phy"},{"tree_label":"FRD3","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fagopyrum FRD3","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79952.phy"},{"tree_label":"ART1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fagopyrum ART1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_79949.phy"}]}
