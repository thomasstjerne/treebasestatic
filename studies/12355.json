This water mould is able to infect stems\nand leaves of Sanionia moss (Sanionia uncinata). P. polare causes brown\ndiscoloration in in vitro inoculation tests at 5ÂºC after 5 weeks of\ninoculation. It is characterized by globose sporangia with various\nlengths of discharge tubes releasing zoospores and aplerotic oospores\nwith usually one to five antheridia. The sexual structures are only\nproduced in a dual culture of antheridial and oogonial isolates.\nPhylogenetic analysis, based on ITS sequencing, places all isolated\nstrains of P. polare in a unique new clade, hence it is considered a\nnovel species. Pythium canariense and Pythium violae are the most\nclosely related species of P. polare based both on morphology and the\nphylogenetic analysis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJT","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_51292.phy"}]}
