Species of Diaporthe\nare important fungal pathogens of grapevine trunk disease worldwide. A\nsurvey of 14 grape vineyards located in different provinces of China was\nyielded Diaporthe isolates associated with symptomatic grapevine wood.\nThese isolates were identified based on morphology and a combined data\nmatrix of rDNA ITS, partial sequences of translation elongation factor\n1-Î± (EF 1-Î±), Î²-tubulin (TUB) and calmodulin (CAL) gene regions. Four\nspecies of Diaporthe were identified, which included Diaporthe eres, D.\nhongkongensis, D. phaseolorum and D. sojae. All isolates of Diaporthe\ncaused disease on detached grape shoots in pathogenicity experiments but\ndiffered in virulence. The incidence in local vineyards and the\npathogenicity results indicate that D. eres is an important pathogen of\ngrapevine in Chinese vineyards, where it may significantly limit grape\nproduction. This is the first detailed report of Diaporthe species\nassociated with grapevine trunk diseases in China with morphology,\npathogenicity and molecular data.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Diaporthe species associated with grapevine trunk\ndisease MPT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_79351.phy"}]}
