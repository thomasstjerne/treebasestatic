The hemibiotrophic fungus\nColletotrichum lindemuthianum (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata f. sp.\nphaseoli) is the causal agent of the anthracnose of the common bean; and\nsimilar to other phytopathogens, it uses multiple strategies to gain\naccess to different carbon sources from its host. In this study, we\nexamine mfs1, a newly identified C. lindemuthianum hexose transporter.\nThe mfs1 gene is expressed only during the necrotrophic phase of the\nfungusâ interaction within the plant and allows it to utilize the\navailable sugars during this phase. The deletion of mfs1 gene resulted\nin differential growth of the fungus in a medium that contained glucose,\nmannose or fructose as the only carbon source. We found that the mfs1\ngene plays a critical role in conidiation and germination C.\nlindemuthianum. This study is the first to describe a hexose transporter\nin the hemibiotrophic pathogen C. lindemuthianum and to demonstrate the\ncentral role of this protein in capturing carbon sources during the\nnecrotrophic development of the plant/pathogen interaction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MFS members that belong to the Ascomycota phylum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_50934.phy"}]}
