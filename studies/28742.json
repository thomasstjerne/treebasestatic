Xylaria nigripes is commonly connected to these massive\nsclerotia produced within abandoned underground macrotermitine termite\nnests. We sequenced 54 Wulingshen samples procured from traditional\nChinese medicine markets in Chengdu Plain and connected them to six\ndifferent Xylaria species: X. nigripes, X. subescharoidea, two species\nnewly described hereinÂ—X. neonigripes and X. rogersionigripes, and two\nspecies that are known only as sclerotia thus far. Only teleomorphs of\nX. subescharoidea and X. rogersionigripes have been collected in Chengdu\nPlain thus far. In Taiwan, teleomorphs of four of the six species,\nexcept for the two only known in sclerotial form, have been collected in\nTaiwan, and their cultures were obtained; we thus designate the\nholotypes of X. neonigripes and X. rogersionigripes on the basis of\nTaiwan specimens. During the collecting activities carried out in\nChengdu Plain, a Xylaria species, which is newly described as X.\nmianyangensis herein, was also collected from termite nests but lacks a\nknown connection to Wulingshen.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML ITS tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr133428","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133428.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB RPB2-TUB-ACT tree","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133430","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133430.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML RPB2-TUB-ACT tree","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr133431","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133431.phy"},{"tree_label":"MB ITS tree","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133429","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133429.phy"}]}
