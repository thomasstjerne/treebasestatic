Many species are considered agricultural\npests of economically important crops around the globe. Mitochondrial\ngenomes are valuable for evolutionary and phylogenetic studies, but have\nbeen little explored for Pentatomidae. Here, we characterized the\nmitochondrial genomes of four pentatomid species (Diceraeus melacanthus,\nEuschistus heros, Piezodorus guildinii, and Stiretrus anchorago) and\nperformed a comparative analysis for this family and its subfamilies.\nStink bug mitogenomes disclosed a conserved gene order and content,\nalthough we detected two uncommon armless tRNAs in E. heros and D.\nmelacanthus. Phylogenetic results indicate that Pentatominae is\npolyphyletic, showing that internal relationships of Pentatomidae should\nbe further investigated. Stink bug mitochondrial genes are under strong\npurifying selection, except for ATP8 which showed signs of positive\nselection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Mr Bayes Output","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Mitogenome Phylogeny of Pentatomidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_135575.phy"}]}
