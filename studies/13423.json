The family contributes to land snail diversity\non a global scale, with three main centres of diversity: 1) western\nEurasia (6 subfamilies recognized), 2) East Asia (2 subfamilies\nrecognized) and 3) the neotropics (1 subfamily recognized\ni.e. Neniinae). Despite a wealth of shell-morphological and anatomical\nstudies, a well-supported phylogeny is lacking for the family. To\nprovide a phylogenetic framework and reevaluate morphological and\nbiogeographic observations on the family, we compiled a dataset\nconsisting of partial 28S rRNA, histone H3 and histone H4 nucleotide\nsequences covering all clausiliid subfamilies, and 23 out of 25 tribes.\nOur analyses (MrBayes, BEAST, PhyML) divide the family into seven highly\nsupported clades, which were retrieved by at least two of the three\nmarkers used, and which are more or less geographically confined. Three\nof these clades coincide with subfamilies recognized in the current\nclassification (Alopiinae, Garnieriinae, Laminiferinae). The monophyly\nof four of the remaining six hitherto accepted subfamilies is not\nsupported, with the New World subfamily Neniinae divided across two\nclades. All shell-morphological characters used in classical clausiliid\nclassification were homoplasious at the subfamily level, with the\nexception of the type of shell aperture formation. In contrast to\nprevious interpretations, our results suggest that the so-called\nâapostrophicâ aperture found in the neotropical clausiliids, and in a\nEuropean (Laminiferinae) and a SE Asian (Garnieriinae) subfamily, is in\nfact the plesiomorphic condition among extant Clausiliidae. The\nwidespread and fragmented geographic distribution of this type of\naperture may therefore be considered relictual. Based on an inferred\nLate Cretaceous or Early Cenozoic European origin of the clade of extant\nClausiliidae, the ancestor(s) of the neotropical Clausiliidae must have\ncolonized the New World after the Atlantic Ocean had opened. A taxonomic\nrevision is proposed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 1","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA MrBayes 50% majrule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60340.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 2","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae histone H3 MrBayes 50% majrule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60341.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 BEAST\nmaximum clade credibility tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60346.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 7","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 ML\nbootstrap tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60348.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 8","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 ML\ntree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60347.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 3","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae histone H4 MrBayes 50% majrule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60342.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 4","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 MrBayes\n50% majrule consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60343.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 5","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 MrBayes\nmaximum clade credibility tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_60344.phy"},{"tree_label":"supplementary tree 6","ntax":"73","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Clausiliidae 28S rRNA + histone H3 + histone H4 BEAST\n50% majrule consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_60345.phy"}]}
