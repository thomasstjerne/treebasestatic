The tribe\ncurrently includes seven genera: Aschersoniodoxa, Brayopsis,\nDactylocardamum, Delpinophytum, Eudema, Onuris, and Xerodraba and\nexhibits a wide morphological diversification in growth habit,\ninflorescences, and fruits. However, little is known about the\nphylogenetic relationships and evolution of the tribe. We present here a\nmolecular phylogeny of representative sampling of all genera, utilizing\nsequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and chloroplast\nregions trnL-F, trnH-psbA, and rps16. Additionally,\necoclimatological-niche of the tribe and its main lineages, along with\nthe evolution of diagnostic morphological characters, were studied. All\nanalyses confirmed the monophyly of Eudemeae, with the exception of\nDelpinophytum that was included with genera of the lineage I of\nBrassicaceae. Eudemeae is divided into two main lineages differentiated\nby their geographical distribution and ecoclimatological niche: the\nprimarily north-central Andean lineage included Aschersoniodoxa,\nBrayopsis, Dactylocardamum, and Eudema, and the Patagonian and southern\nAndean lineage included Onuris and Xerodraba. Finally, ancestral-state\nreconstructions in the tribe generally reveal multiple and independent\ngains or losses of diagnostic morphological characters, such as growth\nform, inflorescence reduction, and fruit type. Relevant taxonomic\nimplications stemming from the results are also discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae ITS DNA bayesian majority-rule consensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74604.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnL-F DNA bayesian majority-rule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74605.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae ncDNA+cpDNA DNA bayesian majority-rule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74610.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnH-psbA GAPS maximum parsimony strict\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74613.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae rps16 DNA bayesian majority-rule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74607.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnH-psbA DNA bayesian majority-rule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74606.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae cpDNA DNA bayesian majority-rule\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74609.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae trnL-F GAPS maximum parsimony strict\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74614.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae rps16 GAPS maximum parsimony strict\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74612.phy"},{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eudemeae ITS GAPS maximum parsimony strict\nconsensus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_74611.phy"}]}
