The data set has\nconsiderable homoplasy, but still contains phylogenetic information. The\nphylogeny obtained is moderately resolved and, with some notable\nexceptions, supports the species complexes proposed by Hellenthal and\nPrice over the the last two decades. The subgenera G. (Thaelerius) and\nT. (Thomomydoecus) are both shown to be monophyletic, but the monophly\nof subgenus T. (Jamespattonius) could not be confirmed, perhaps due to\nthe lack of first-instar data for one of its component species. The\nnominate subgenus of Geomydoecus may be monophyletic, but our cladogram\nwas insufficiently resolved to corroborate this. Mapping the pocket\ngopher hosts onto the phylogeny reveals a consistent pattern of louse\nclades being restncted to particular genera or subgenera of gophers, but\nthe history of the host-parasite association appears complex and will\nrequire considerable effort to resolve.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gopher lice","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3504.phy"}]}
