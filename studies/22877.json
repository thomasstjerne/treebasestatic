In\nToxoplasma gondii and other apicomplexan parasites, many subunit\ncomponents, necessary for proper assembly and functioning of this\nenzyme, appear to be missing. Here, we report the identification of 20\nnovel subunits of T. gondii F-type ATP synthase from mass spectrometry\nanalysis of partially purified monomer (~600 kDa) and dimer (>1 MDa)\nforms of the enzyme. Despite extreme sequence diversification, key FO\nsubunits, a, b and d, can be identified from conserved structural\nfeatures. Orthologs for many of these proteins are restricted to\napicomplexan, chromerid and dinoflagellate species. Interestingly, their\nabsence in ciliates indicates a major diversion, with respect to subunit\ncomposition of this enzyme, within the alveolate clade. Discovery of\nthese highly diversified novel components of the apicomplexan F-type ATP\nsynthase complex will facilitate the development of novel anti-parasitic\nagents. Structural and functional characterization of this unusual\nenzyme complex will advance our fundamental of energy metabolism in\napicomplexan species","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112233","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112233.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112249.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112238","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112238.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112228","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112228.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112246.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"6","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112250.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112245.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112229","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112229.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112239","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112239.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112241","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112241.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112234","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112234.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112240","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112240.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112226","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112226.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112244","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112244.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112227","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112227.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112237","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112237.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112248.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112243","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112243.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112231","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112231.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112247.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112242","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112242.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112225","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112225.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112232","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112232.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112236","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112236.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112224","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112224.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112230","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112230.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr112235","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112235.phy"}]}
