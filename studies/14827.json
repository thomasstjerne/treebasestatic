They need recollecting and\nsequencing so that phylogenetic analysis can resolve their taxonomic\naffinities. The type species of the asexual genera, Bahusandhika,\nCancellidium and Pseudoepicoccum were recollected, isolated in culture,\nand the ITS and LSU gene regions sequenced. The sequence data were\nanalysed with reference data obtained through GenBank. The DNA sequence\nanalyses shows that Bahusandhika indica has a close relationship with\nBerkleasmium in the order Pleosporales and Pseudoepicoccum cocos with\nPiedraia in Capnodiales; both are members of Dothideomycetes.\nCancellidium applanatum forms a distinct lineage in the\nSordariomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cancellidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67317.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bahusandhika","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67314.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"49","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bahusandhika","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67313.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudoepicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67315.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pseudoepicoccum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67316.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cancellidium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67318.phy"}]}
