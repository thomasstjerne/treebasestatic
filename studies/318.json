The\nprevious works include Weitzman’s (1974) revision of the Sternoptychidae\nand classification of stomiiform subgroups at the family level and\nabove, and Fink and Weitzman’s (1982) study of Diplophos and diagnosis\nof the order. Herein, I consider the relationships of the twenty-six\ngenera of stomiiform fishes known as dragonfishes, viperfishes,\nsnaggletooths, and loosejaws. Traditionally these fishes have been\nplaced in six families, Astronesthidae, Chauliodontidae, Idiacanthidae,\nMalacosteidae, Melanostomiidae, and Stomiidae, and most recently they\nwere considered to comprise the superfamily Stomioidea (Weitzman, 1974).\nThese generally elongate, darkly-pigmented fishes are characterized by\nnumerous specializations, including presence of a mental barbel\nassociated with the hyoid apparatus, lack of gill rakers in adults, and\ninsertion on the PO (postorbital) photophore of a portion of the\nadductor mandibulae muscle. By inference from their morphology and\nnumbers, it appears that these organisms are an important component of\nthe oceanic vertebrate fauna.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1468.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1469.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1470.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6A","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1471.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6B","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1472.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6C","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1473.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6D","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stomiidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1474.phy"}]}
