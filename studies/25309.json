The subdivision of Central and Eastern European\nHelicopsis reflects the geographical subdivision of the European steppe\nbelt in Pontic, Pannonian and Northern steppes. The subdivision within\nHelicopsis is deeper, at the species level, than in most other steppe\ninhabiting groups. The Helicopsis populations from the Pontic steppes\ncan be classified into two sister species. Helicopsis lunulata includes\nmainly populations with depressed conical shells previously identified\nas H. striata, but also populations with disc-like shells previously\nidentified as H. instabilis. The species is distributed mainly west of\nthe Dnieper River. Most Helicopsis populations from east of the Dnieper,\nespecially from Crimea, belong to the very variable H. filimargo that\nincludes also H. gasprensis, H. retowskii, H. arenosa, H. luganica, H.\nmartynovi and H. subfilimargo. The species inhabiting the Pannonian\nBasin and the Northern steppes formed a well-supported monophylum\nincluding H. hungarica in the Pannonian Basin, H. austriaca at the\nfringe of the East Alps and H. striata mainly in the Northern\nsteppes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helicopsis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126624.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Helicopsis 16S","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126623.phy"}]}
