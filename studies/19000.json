Their life cycle includes merogony with\nmultinucleate plasmodia and sporogony leading to small, uninucleate\nspores. We examined the phylogenetic affiliations of three species of\nNephridiophaga, including one new species, Nephridiophaga maderae, from\nthe Madeira cockroach (Leucophaea maderae). In addition to the specific\nhost, the new species differs from those already known by the size of\nthe spores and by the number of spores within the sporogenic plasmodium.\nThe inferred phylogenetic analyses strongly support a placement of the\nnephridiophagids in the fungal kingdom near its root and with a\nphylogenetic relationship to the chytrids. We found evidence for the\nnephridiophagidean speciation as being strongly coupled to host\nspeciation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian after 20 million gen","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holomycota","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_94721.phy"}]}
