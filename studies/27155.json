Collected from subtropical Yunnan Province in\nsouthwest China, Rhomboidia is characterized by annual, resupinate\nbasidiomes with rose hymenial surface, a monomitic hyphal system with\ngenerative hyphae bearing simple septa, and ellipsoid basidiospores with\nthin, hyaline, smooth walls. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and ITS+nLSU\nnuclear RNA gene regions showed that Flavodontia formed as distinct,\nmonophyletic lineage within a subclade that includes Flavodon and\nIrpex.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Irpicaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129703.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Irpicaceae ITS nLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129705.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 3","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Irpicaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129704.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Irpicaceae ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129702.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 2","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Irpicaceae ITS nLSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129706.phy"}]}
