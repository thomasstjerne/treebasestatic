We introduce a new species, Phyllosticta rhizophorae from\nRhizophora stylosa in mangroves, Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis based on\ncombined sequence data of ITS, LSU, EF1Î±, ACT and GPDH loci coupled with\nmorphological evidence support the new species. We synonymize P.\ncapitalensis (CPC 20508 and CPC20509) under the new species,\nPhyllosticta conjac (MUCC0410) under P. capitalensis and six strains\n(CBS 173.77, CBS 119720, CPC 17748, CPC 20252, CPC 20269, and CBS\n123404) were kept as unknown species based on phylogenetic analyses and\npolymorphism nucleotide. The phylogenetic relationships of Phyllosticta\nspecies are reappraised with suggestions for future work.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"196","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123815","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123815.phy"}]}
