Papilionoideae.\nOriginally allied with Tephrosia (Millettieae), subsequent studies\nrevealed that Sphinctospermum has a base chromosome number of x = 8 and\nseeds that accumulate the non-protein amino acid canavanine. Such\nevidence was used to support its inclusion in Robinieae. A cladistic\nanalysis of primarily morphological data is presented that incorporates\nnew or newly interpreted characters, including anatomical and\ndevelopmental features. These data do not support a sister group\nrelationship of Sphinctospermum and Coursetia, as previously proposed by\nsome workers. Furthermore, the results of this analysis of traditional\ndata are equivocal and suggest that the probable affinities of\nSphinctospermum are just as likely to be with genera of Millettieae than\nwith those of Robinieae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 21","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1402.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 22","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sphinctospermum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1403.phy"}]}
