Phylogenetic analysis\n(maximum parsimony, spectral analysis) of these sequences placed the\nAgyriineae outside the Lecanorales and suggested a sister group\nrelationship to Ostropales/Pertusariales. The resurrection of the order\nAgyriales is proposed based on molecular and morphological data, such as\nfaintly amyloid asci opening by dehiscence. The sequence data support\nthe two families Agyriaceae and Anamylopsoraceae to be accomodated\nwithin the order Agyriales. The Agyriales, Ostropales and Pertusariales\ncan be placed in the class Lecanoromycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"MP tree of manually optimized alignment as\nsubmitted","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3625.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"consensus of 31 MP trees obtained from 5 automaticlly\naligned matrices","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3626.phy"}]}
