This has made\nit difficult to identify the phylogenetic root of the genus. In this\nstudy, we addressed this problem and characterized the early branching\npatterns within Isoëtes using an expanded set of taxa and three\nmolecular markers. We assessed the saturation in the molecular data\nsets, tested for differences in evolutionary rate, determined the\nstability of the ingroup topology, and evaluated the applicability of\nthe molecular clock. We then explored three alternative rooting\napproaches: outgroup, midpoint, and maximum likelihood under the\nassumption of a molecular clock. Attempts to infer the root of Isoëtes\nusing the outgroup approach were severely hindered by the effects of\nsaturation, but the results from midpoint rooting and the enforcement of\nthe molecular clock were highly consistent among the data sets. We\nidentify the root of Isoëtes to be located among three major, highly\nsupported clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"16","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Root of Isoëtes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6294.phy"}]}
