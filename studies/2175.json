P. senticosum is a fast-growing species and grows even at\n5˚C with a radial growth. The species is characterized by the ovoid to\nellipsoid sporangia with an apical papilla, the ornamented oogonia with\nacute conical spines, the bell-shaped antheridial cells and the\namphigynous-like antheridia. P. takayamanum is a high-temperature\ngrowing species that can grow even at 35˚C. The species is\nmorphologically characterized by the wavy antheridial stalk and\nellipsoidal bent oogonia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5344.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6a","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5343.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4a","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5341.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4b","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pythium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5342.phy"}]}
