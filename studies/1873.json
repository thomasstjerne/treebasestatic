To resolve its position within the\nPaniceae and to test the monophyly of this section, phylogenetic\nanalyses based on chloroplast sequence data (ndhF) and morphology were\nconducted for the Paniceae with particular emphasis on Panicum section\nLorea. The results did not support the monophyly of this section. The\nspecies of this group were resolved in two clades which are not sister\ngroups and neither of them is closely related to Panicum s.s. As a\nresult, two new genera are proposed and described: Apochloa and\nRenvoizea, which are restricted to the Guiana highlands and eastern\nBrazil. New combinations are: Apochloa animara, A. bahiense, A.\nchnoodes, A. cipoense, A. eligulata, A. euprepes, A. jauana, A. lorea,\nA. lutzii, A. molinioides, A. poliophylla, A. sipapoense, A.\nsteyermarkii, A. subtiramulosa, A. tijucae, Renvoizea acicularifolia, R.\ndurifolia, R. glaziovii, R. lagostachya, R. marauense, R. restingae, R.\nsacciolepoides, R. teretifolia, R. trinii and R. vaginiviscosa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"142","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1041.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paniceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1042.phy"}]}
