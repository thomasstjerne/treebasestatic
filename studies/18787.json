Although drafts of three conifer genomes have recently been\npublished, this number is too low to understand the full complexity of\nconifer genomes. Using techniques focused on specific genes, gene models\ncan be established that can aid in the assembly of gene-rich regions,\nand this information can be used to compare genomes and understand\nfunctional evolution.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic tree of the deduced protein sequences of\nplant genes encoding asparagine synthetase (AS).","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93471.phy"}]}
