Molecular and\nmorphological analyses place this species as a distinct group within the\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato species complex. The fungus is\nassociated with dieback and canker of twigs and young branches of\npersimmon, as well as spots on unripe fruit. The disease occurs on\npersimmon in China, Japan, and Korea, and is reported for the first time\nfrom New Zealand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum horii nom. nov.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6034.phy"}]}
