The concatenated LSU, SSU, TEF1α and ITS\nmultigene phylogenetic analyses revealed that Vittalia clustered\ntogether with Italica as a sister clade but forms a separate branch. In\naddition, morphological variations in Vittalia mangrovei such as\nsemi-immersed, globose to sub-globose ascomata, 56 distoseptate,\nphragmosporous and yellow to golden-yellow ascospores with high\nconstriction at the 4th septum, lacking mucilaginous sheath or any\nornamentation clearly delineate the new taxon from the other genera in\nPhaeosphaeriaceae. Furthermore, Vittalia is saprobic and occurs\nexclusively in marine environment. Morphological characteristics and\nphylogenetic relation of Vittalia are discussed by comparing with\nclosely related genera in Phaeosphaeriaceae in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115517","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115517.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"116","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115518","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115518.phy"}]}
