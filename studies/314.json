In this study partial sequences from the\n28S rRNA gene were used to test two alternative hypotheses: (i) that the\nMonotropoideae share a most recent common ancestor with the Arbutoideae\nin the Ericaceae or (ii) that the Monotropoideae is the end result of a\ngradual transition from autotrophism to mycotrophic parasitism in the\nPyrolaceae. Our results support the hypothesis that the Monotropoideae\nand the Arbutoideae are a monophyletic group and that the Monotropoideae\nshould be included in the Ericaceae rather than the Pyrolaceae. The\nMonotropoid species Pleuricospora fimbriolata could not be placed within\neither the Monotropoideae or the Arbutoideae with any degree of\nconfidence, leaving open the possibility that the Monotropoideae is\npolyphyletic.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1465.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"9","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1463.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"8","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ericales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1464.phy"}]}
