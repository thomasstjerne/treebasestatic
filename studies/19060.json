The strains showed phenotypic properties in common and were\ndistinguished from B. nivea, B. aristata, and B. proliferans. According\nto these results the name Blastobotrysmeliponaeis proposed for the new\nspecies.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Blastobotrys meliponae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97640.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Blastobotrys meliponae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_97641.phy"}]}
