(Calypsoeae, Orchidaceae), which is distributed in East\nAsia, have not yet been identified. Since these species are endangered\nin nature, adding their mycorrhizal association would be beneficial to\nprovide fundamental information for preventing future extinction. We\nidentified the mycobionts of three Japanese Yoania species, Y.\namagiensis, Y. flava, and Y. japonica by sequencing internal transcribed\nspacer nuclear ribosomal DNA region. Obtained sequences were assigned\ninto five operational taxonomic units (OTUs), where four of these five\nbelonged to the white-rot genus Physisporinus (Meripilaceae,\nPolyporales). Y. flava and Y. japonica were specifically associated with\nPhysisporinus fungi within a single OTU, while Y. amagiensis was\nassociated with Physisporinus in four OTUs. Phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that fungal sequences from other MH orchids, Cyrtosia and\nGaleola species, available in GenBank, also belonged to Physisporinus.\nThese results suggest that Physisporinus plays an important role in MH\nassociation in Yoania species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118893","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118893.phy"}]}
