These were studied and compared with\nrelated taxa, based on the evidence from morphology and phylogenetic\nanalyses of a combined LSU and SSU DNA sequence data. A new host record,\nMuyocopron dipterocarpi and a new taxon, Muyocopron heveae are described\nand illustrated. Muyocopron heveae can be differentiated from the\npreviously described species of Muyocopron in its asci and ascospores\ndimensions. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined LSU and SSU sequence\ndata indicated that our strains cluster in Muyocopron and the new taxon\nforms a distinct clade as a new species in the genus. The germinating\nascospores produced appressoria which suggests it has an endophytic\nlifestyle. The taxa appear to have jumped host to rubber, which had been\nintroduced to Thailand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Muyocopron","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_114153.phy"}]}
