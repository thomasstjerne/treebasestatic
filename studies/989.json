Traditional definitions of genera\nin the group have relied on morphological features of the leaves,\nflower, and fruit that overlap extensively between genera. Therefore\nsequences of cpDNA (trnL-F intron and spacer) and nrDNA (ITS) were used\nto estimate the phylogeny of the group in an attempt to redefine the\ngenera as monophyletic groups. Oxylobium sens. str. was found to be a\nwell supported clade in both data sets, with the inclusion of Mirbelia\noxylobioides. No other genus in the group was supported by these data,\nexcept Gastrolobium sens. lat. Some species groups within Chorizema,\nMirbelia, and Podolobium were supported but relationships among these,\nOxylobium and Gastrolobium differed significantly between the\nchloroplast and nuclear data sets. No group supported by the molecular\ndata had a morphological synapomorphy, not even Oxylobium or\nGastrolobium. Therefore it may be necessary to adopt a much broader\ngeneric concept in this group than has been done previously.\nIncongruence between the two molecular data sets, and very short\ninternal basal branches in both, suggest a rapid early radiation in this\ngroup, possibly combined with hybridization and lineage sorting.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4085.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"trnL-F","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_4086.phy"}]}
