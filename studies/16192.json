The collections growing on\nxylariaceous fungi have been identified previously as ‘Cosmospora\nvilior,’ and more recently these fungi have been identified as\nCosmospora viliuscula. Cosmospora vilior s.str. occurs on a Eutypella\nspecies. The present research shows that C. viliuscula is a species\ncomplex comprising several species. In this paper, the phylogenetic\nrelationships and taxonomy of the members of the C. viliuscula complex\nare revised. A phylogeny was generated with maximum likelihood and\nBayesian inference methods based on a three-partition dataset (ITS, LSU,\nand mcm7-rpb1-tub2). We demonstrate that Cosmospora viliuscula\nrepresents a species complex of which each well-supported clade is\nregarded as species. A few rare species in the complex, based upon\nsingle collections, were also described, namely C. fomiticola, C.\nnovazelandica, and C. stilbohypoxyli. For the first time the sexual\nmorphs of C. arxii and C. khandalensis are described","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76777","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76777.phy"}]}
