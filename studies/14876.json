Many species of the\nMycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae are thought to occur as\nasymptomatic endophytes. In this study, endophytic species of\nMycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae were isolated from samples\ntaken from healthy native Syzygium cordatum (Myrtaceae) and related\nnon-native Eucalyptus grandis x E.camaldulensis (hybrid clone) growing\nin Mtubatuba, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. Multi-locus sequence analysis\nusing the Internally Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region, the partial Large\nSubunit (LSU; 28S nrDNA) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA operon and\nTranslation Elongation Factor-1α (TEF-1α) genes were used to correctly\nidentify the 22 resulting isolates. The isolates grouped in five clades\nrepresenting Readeriella considenianae that was isolated only from the\nEucalyptus hybrid clone, Mycosphaerella marksii and M. vietnamensis from\nS. cordatum and Pseudocercospora crystallina from both S. cordatum and\nthe Eucalyptus hybrid clone. Interestingly, the serious canker pathogen\nT. zuluensis was isolated from Eucalyptus leaves, although it is known\nonly from stem and branch cankers. Of the species found, R.\nconsidenianae and M. vietnamensis were found in South Africa for the\nfirst time, while M. marksii, M. vietnamensis and P. crystallina were\nshown to naturally infect native S. cordatum for the first time. Despite\nthe limited number of trees sampled, the new host and distribution\nreports show that more intensive sampling, especially following an\nendophyte approach, will reveal more complete patterns of host\npreference and geographical distribution for these fungi.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
