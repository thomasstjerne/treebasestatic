Ovisporae are described\nfrom tropical China. Lepiota angusticystidiata is characterized by its\npileus with brownish yellow squamules, ellipsoid basidiospores, narrowly\nclavate cheilocystidia, pileus covering a trichodermial palisade, while\nL. brunneosquamulosa by its pileus with brownish yellow to yellowish\nbrown concentrical tomentose squamulose, ellipsoid or subcylindrical\nbasidiospore with straight adaxial side, lacking cheilocystidia, and\npileus covering a trichodermial palisade, rarely with short elements.\nPhylogenetic relationships among the species in sect. Ovisporae were\ninferred based on DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal genes (ITS, LSU\nand IGS) and the mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA gene (mtSSU).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"23","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lepiota","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105895.phy"}]}
