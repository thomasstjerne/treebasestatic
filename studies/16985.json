In recent years, this\ndisease has sporadically appeared across the eastern states of\nAustralia. In this study, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region\nsequences were used to compare these fungi to other Botryosphaeriaceae\nspp. to show that they should be reclassified as members of the\nTiarosporella genus. Using a small population of WGD isolates, we built\na three-loci maximum likelihood tree, using ITS, β-tubulin, and\nElongation Factor1-α sequences to show that there are three separate\nTiarosporella spp. found in infected grain. This multigene tree, with\nthe support of phenotypic differences between clades observed in vitro,\nshow that that the causal agents of WGD should be delimited into three\ndivergent species; Tiarosporella tritici-australis, Tiarosporella\ndarliae, and Tiarosporella pseudodarliae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81294","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81294.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"14","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81295","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81295.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr81296","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_81296.phy"}]}
