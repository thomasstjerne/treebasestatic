In the present paper,\nMinutisphaera aquaticum sp. nov., is introduced from submerged wood\ncollected in the Mekong River in eastern Thailand, and increases the\nknown diversity of Minutisphaeraceae. Minutisphaera aquaticum is\ncharacterized by superficial, small globose, dark brown to black\nascomata, bitunicate, fissitunicate, obovoid to broadly cylindrical asci\nand fusiform, hyaline ascospores with a supra-median primary septum and\nupper cells that are wider than the lower cells. The multigene\nphylogenetic analysis places a new taxon formed a well-supported clade\nwith the species in Minutisphaeraceae (Minutisphaerales). The new\nspecies is compared with other Minutisphaera specie, description and\nillustration are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"41","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Minutisphaeraceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121812.phy"}]}
