According to molecular phylogenetic analyses based on\nthe internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene and\nmitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, the isolate was\nre-identified as G. lacustre sp. nov. The morphology, phylogeny, and\npathogenicity of the new species are described here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102091","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102091.phy"}]}
