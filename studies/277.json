Sequence data from a portion of the ribosomal large\nsubunit (nDNA) and morphological data were analyzed separately as well\nas in combination. Three monophyletic groups were clearly distinguished:\nPeniophora spp., Aleurocystidiellum spp., Acanthophysium + Stereum spp.\nCharacters used for delimitation of Aleurodiscus s.l. are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1368.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1369.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1370.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1365.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1366.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"28","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Aphyllophorales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1367.phy"}]}
