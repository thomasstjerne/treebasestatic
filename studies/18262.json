In the\nprocess, three major species complexes (C. cladosporioides, C. herbarum\nand C. sphaerospermum) were resolved based on morphology and DNA\nphylogeny, and a monographic revision of the genus (s. lat.) published\nreflecting the current taxonomic status quo. In the present study a\nfurther 19 new species are described based on phylogenetic characters\n(nuclear ribosomal RNA gene operon, including the internal transcribed\nspacer regions ITS1 and ITS2, as well as partial actin and translation\nelongation factor 1-Î± gene sequences) and morphological differences. For\na selection of the species with ornamented conidia, scanning electron\nmicroscopic photos were prepared to illustrate the different types of\nsurface ornamentation. Surprisingly, during this study Cladosporium\nramotenellum was found to be a quite common saprobic species, being\nwidely distributed and occurring on various substrates. Therefore, an\nemended species description is provided. Furthermore, the host range and\ndistribution data for several previously described species are also\nexpanded.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Cladosporium cladosporioides complex unpublished actA\nphylogeny","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96247","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96247.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cladosporium cladosporioides complex unpublished ITS\nphylogeny","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96246","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96246.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cladosporium cladosporioides complex unpublished tef1\nphylogeny","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96248","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96248.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cladosporium herbarum and C. sphaerospermum complexes\nunpublished ITS phylogeny","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96250","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96250.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cladosporium herbarum and C. sphaerospermum complexes\nunpublished tef1 phylogeny","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96252","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96252.phy"},{"tree_label":"Cladosporium herbarum and C. sphaerospermum complexes\nunpublished actA phylogeny","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96251","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96251.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96245","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96245.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96249","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96249.phy"}]}
