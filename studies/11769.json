Interspecific evolutionary\nrelationships were inferred for 36 Pinnularia taxa using a five-locus\ndataset. A range of fossil taxa, including newly-discovered Middle\nEocene forms of Pinnularia, was used to calibrate a relaxed molecular\nclock analysis and investigate the temporal aspects of the genusâ€™\ndiversification. The multigene approach resulted in a well-resolved\nphylogeny of three major clades and several subclades that were\nfrequently, but not universally, delimited by valve morphology. The\nsister genus Caloneis was not recovered as monophyletic, confirming\nthat, as currently delimited, this genus is not evolutionarily\nmeaningful and should be merged with (parts of) Pinnularia. The\nPinnularia-Caloneis complex is estimated to have diverged between the\nUpper Cretaceous and the early Eocene, implying a ghost range of at\nleast 10 million year (Ma) in the fossil record.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"44","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pinnularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50580.phy"}]}
