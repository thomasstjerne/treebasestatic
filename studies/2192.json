Eight independent studies based on morphological characters\nfailed to reach any consensus on osmerid interrelationships. We\nreconstruct the osmerid phylogeny based on DNA sequence data from three\nmitochondrial (cytb, 16S, 12S) and three nuclear (ITS2, S71, RAG1) gene\nregions from multiple individuals of the 14 species in 6 genera, using\nthe Japanese ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) as the outgroup. Analyses with\ndifferent combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial datasets yielded a\ngenerally well-resolved phylogeny of the genera that conflicts with\nprevious hypotheses of osmerid interrelationships, and\nShimodaira-Hasegawa tests suggest our topology with the current\nmolecular dataset is significantly better than earlier reconstructions.\nIn addition, mapping 114 morphological characters used in previous\nstudies onto our phylogeny shows widespread homoplasy, which is likely\nthe source of the systematic disagreement produced in earlier\nworks.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3A","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmeridae, mtDNA, MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5396.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4A","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmeridae, allDNA MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3115.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4B","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmeridae. all DNA ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3116.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3B","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Osmeridae, nDNA, MB","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5397.phy"}]}
