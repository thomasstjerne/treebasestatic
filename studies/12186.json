However, primate taxonomy is both\ncomplex and controversial, with marginal unifying consensus of the\nevolutionary hierarchy of extant primate species. Here we provide new\ngenomic sequence (,8 Mb) from 186 primates representing 61 (,90%) of the\ndescribed genera, and we include outgroup species from Dermoptera,\nScandentia, and Lagomorpha. The resultant phylogeny is exceptionally\nrobust and illuminates events in primate evolution from ancient to\nrecent, clarifying numerous taxonomic controversies and providing new\ndata on human evolution. Ongoing speciation, reticulate evolution,\nancient relic lineages, unequal rates of evolution, and disparate\ndistributions of insertions/deletions among the reconstructed primate\nlineages are uncovered. Our resolution of the primate phylogeny provides\nan essential evolutionary framework with far-reaching applications\nincluding: human selection and adaptation, global emergence of zoonotic\ndiseases, mammalian comparative genomics, primate taxonomy, and\nconservation of endangered species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"191","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Molecular Phylogeny of 186 Primates","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50066.phy"}]}
