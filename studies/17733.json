To date,\nphylogenetic relationships within the genus have not been well resolved.\nThe main goal of this study is to construct a backbone phylogeny of\nPedicularis, with extensive sampling of species from the\nHimalaya-Hengduan Mountains. Phylogenetic analyses included 257 species,\nrepresenting all 13 informal groups and 104 out of 130 series in the\nclassification system of Tsoong, using sequences of the nuclear\nribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and three plastid regions\n(matK, rbcL and trnL-F). Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood\nmethods were applied in separate and combined analyses of these\ndatasets.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"352","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pedicularis ITS+matK+rbcL+trnL-F Bayesian","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_88270.phy"}]}
