It is characterized by perennial,\nresupinate basidiocarps with buff-yellow pores, margin and subiculum\nwith rhizomorphs, a dimitic hyphal structure with yellowish crystals on\nboth generative and skeletal hyphae, generative hyphae bearing clamp\nconnections, dextrinoid and cyanophilous skeletal hyphae, the absence of\ngloeoplerous hyphae and gloeocystidia, and broadly ellipsoid, hyaline,\nthick-walled, finely asperulate, strongly amyloid, cyanophilous\nbasidiospore measuring as 3.84.2 × 2.83.2 µm. Molecular phylogenetic\nanalyses based on ITS and nLSU rDNA sequences confirmed that W.\nsrilankensis nested in Wrightoporia clade. W. srilankensis is closely\nrelated to Wrightoporia avellanea which, however, lacks cystidioles, and\nits hyphae are smooth (without crystals).","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Wrightoporia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122974.phy"}]}
