A multi-gene\nphylogeny based on a portion of the 18S nuclear ribosomal gene, the\nnuclear rRNA cluster comprising the ITS region plus the D1/D2 variable\ndomains of the LSU gene, together with the translation elongation factor\n1-alpha gene and part of the beta-tubulin gene was constructed. In this\nphylogeny, M. tulasnei clustered with an isolate of Botryosphaeria\nquercuum near the root of the Botryosphaeriaceae. On account of the\nmorphological and phylogenetic distinctions from other genera in the\nBotryosphaeriaceae, it is recommended that the genus Melanops should be\nreinstated. An epitype specimen of M. tulasnei was selected and\nex-epitype cultures deposited in the public collection of CBS.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanops","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6231.phy"},{"tree_label":"Bayes","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Melanops","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6202.phy"}]}
