When\nconflict between gene trees is discovered, it is common practice either\nto analyze the data separately, or to combine the data having excluded\nthe conflicting taxa or data partitions for those taxa (which are then\nrecoded as missing). We demonstrate an alternative approach, which\ninvolves duplicating conflicting taxa in the matrix, such that each\nduplicate is represented by one partition only. This allows the\ncombination of all available data in standard phylogenetic analyses,\ndespite reticulations. We show how interpretation of contradictory gene\ntrees can lead to conflicting inferences of both morphological evolution\nand biogeographic history, using the example of the pampas grasses,\nCortaderia. The characteristic morphological syndrome of Cortaderia can\nbe inferred as having arisen multiple times (chloroplast: cpDNA), or\njust once (nuclear: nrDNA). The distributions of species of Cortaderia\nand related genera in Australia/New Guinea, New Zealand, and South\nAmerica can be explained by few (nrDNA), or several (cpDNA) dispersals\nbetween the southern continents. These contradictions can be explained\nby past hybridization events which have linked gains of complex\nmorphologies with unrelated chloroplast lineages and have erased\nevidence of dispersals from the nuclear genome. Given the discrepancies\nbetween inferences based on the gene trees individually, we urge the use\nof approaches such as ours that take multiple gene trees into\naccount.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Appendix 3b","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6308.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6651.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3c","ntax":"68","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6529.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3d","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3e","ntax":"83","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6026.phy"},{"tree_label":"Appendix 3a","ntax":"69","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Danthonioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6565.phy"}]}
