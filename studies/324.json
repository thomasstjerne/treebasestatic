This large, distinct family (2100 species) is mostly from\nthe new world tropics. Among 10 possibly closely related families to the\nmonotypic order Bromeliales, Velloziaceae of Bromeliflorae appear to be\nthe most likely to share the same common ancestor with Bromeliacae,\nthough other members of Bromeliflorae (and some Zingiberiflorae and\nCommeliniflorae) are also implicated by the analyses. Nearly all of\nthese sister taxa have the same effect in polarizing morphological and\nanatomical characters. Cladistic analyses placed Bromelioideae and\nTillandsioideae as sister taxa and the third subfamily, Pitcairnioideae\nin close proximity to the familyâ€™s putative ancestor. A possible\nexplanation of the revealed, multiple lineage relationships and phenetic\nresemblances among families is a hybrid, paleopolyploid origin of\nBromeliaceae. Chromosome numbers are in accord with this notion of\nreticulate evolution having occurred during the origin of the monotypic\norder, Bromeliales.","trees":[{"tree_label":"3D","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_194.phy"},{"tree_label":"3E","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_195.phy"},{"tree_label":"7D","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_205.phy"},{"tree_label":"4A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_196.phy"},{"tree_label":"3C","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_193.phy"},{"tree_label":"3A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_191.phy"},{"tree_label":"3B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_192.phy"},{"tree_label":"4C","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_197.phy"},{"tree_label":"4B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_198.phy"},{"tree_label":"5","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_199.phy"},{"tree_label":"6A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_200.phy"},{"tree_label":"6B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_201.phy"},{"tree_label":"7A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_202.phy"},{"tree_label":"7B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_203.phy"},{"tree_label":"7C","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_204.phy"},{"tree_label":"7E","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_206.phy"},{"tree_label":"8","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_207.phy"},{"tree_label":"9","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_208.phy"},{"tree_label":"10","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_209.phy"},{"tree_label":"11","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_210.phy"},{"tree_label":"12","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_211.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1489.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2A","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1490.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2B","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1491.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2C","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1492.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2D","ntax":"4","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bromeliaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1493.phy"}]}
