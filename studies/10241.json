This\nstudy explores the relationships among these groups using a combined\nanalysis with seven molecular loci (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, histone H3, 16S\nrRNA, COI, myosin heavy chain type II, and elongation factor-1α)\nsequenced for 31 ingroup taxa and 8 outgroup taxa. The deep evolutionary\nsplits among these groups have made resolving stable relationships\ndifficult, so elongation factor-1α and myosin are utilized in an attempt\nto re-examine these ancient radiation events. Two phylogenetic analyses\nwere performed utilizing all seven genes: a single-step direct\noptimization analysis using parsimony and a two-step approach using\nmaximum likelihood. A single-step direct optimization parsimony analysis\nwas also performed using only five molecular loci (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA,\nhistone H3, 16S rRNA, and COI) in order to determine the utility of\nelongation factor-1α and myosin at resolving deep relationships. In the\nlikelihood and POY optimal phylogenetic analyses, Gastropoda,\nCaenogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Neomphalina, and Patellogastropoda were\nmonophyletic. Additionally, Neomphalina and Pleurotomariidae fell\noutside the remaining vetigastropods, indicating the need to for further\ninvestigation into the relationship of these groups to other\ngastropods.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vetigastropoda, 7 arch all 111","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6746.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vetigastropoda, Archaeo 5 gene 3221","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"39","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Vetigastropoda, MUSCLE 7 archl B","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6840.phy"}]}
