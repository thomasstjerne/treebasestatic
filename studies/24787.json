The diversity of Diaporthe species associated\nwith symptomatic and asymptomatic Vaccinium corymbosum plants in\nPortugal was assessed. A multilocus sequence analysis of the rDNA\ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and the translation elongation\nfactor 1-alpha (tef1-α), β-tubulin (tub2), calmodulin (cal) and histone\n3 (his3) genes revealed the presence of Diaporthe foeniculina, Diaporthe\nrudis and four new species, which are described as Diaporthe crousii,\nDiaporthe phillipsii, Diaporthe rossmaniae and Diaporthe vacuae. These\nnew species were characterised in terms of their morphology, mating\nstrategies and temperature growth requirements. In artificial\ninoculation trials of V. corymbosum cv. Bluecrop plants all Diaporthe\nspecies caused minor symptoms. Further, no differences in aggressiveness\nwere apparent between species. This study provides the first survey of\nDiaporthe species associated with blueberry twig blight and dieback in\nPortugal. It disclosed the occurrence of a diverse assemblage of\nDiaporthe species, whose status and impact as pathogens of blueberry is\nnot yet fully understood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr123369","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_123369.phy"}]}
