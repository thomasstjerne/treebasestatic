The new species is distinct\nfrom P. stigonemoides by little projections locally present on thallus,\nsmaller, paler and globose perithecia, smaller asci, and smaller\nascospores generally 3-septate. Molecular analyses employing internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS), mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU), and\nnuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU) sequences strongly support P.\nhumidosilvae as a nonidentical species in the genus Psoroglaena. A\nsurrogate key is provided to assist in the identification of all 22\nspecies of Psoroglaena.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psoroglaena mtSSU Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135865.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psoroglaena ITS Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135864.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psoroglaena LSU Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_135866.phy"}]}
