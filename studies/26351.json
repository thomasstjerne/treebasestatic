Seventeen specimens with close resemblance\nto the species by having blackish, gelatinous basidiocarps were analyzed\nbased on morphological and molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses were\nperformed by the combined ITS+nLSU dataset and the combined\nITS+nLSU+TEF1-a + RPB2 dataset, and 20 ITS, 20 nLSU, 22 TEF1-a, and 20\nRPB2 sequences were newly generated. Seventeen specimens were gathered\ninto three different lineages in phylogenies, and they were identified\nas three species, E. glandulosa s. str. and two new species, E. reflexa\nand E. subglandulosa, respectively. The two new species differ from E.\nglandulosa s. str. by the absence of papillae on hymenial surface, and\nE. reflexa differs from E. subglandulosa by obvious effused-reflexed\nbasidiocarps and smaller basidia and basidiospores. Detailed\ncharacteristics with morphological photos of two new species were\nprovided here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"22","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exidia ITS nLSU TEF1a RPB2 MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126212.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exidia IL ITS-nLSU MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_126213.phy"}]}
