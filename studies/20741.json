Phylogenetic analysis of the internal\ntranscribed spacer region, 28S large subunit regions of nuclear\nribosomal RNA, and translation elongation factor 1 (tef-1) genes showed\nthat both Japanese entities are distinct from any previously described\nCaesars mushrooms, including A. javanica and A. similis sensu stricto.\nTherefore, we described them as new species, Amanita kitamagotake and A.\nchatamagotake, respectively. Interestingly, A. caesareoides (red pileus)\nand A. chatamagotake specimens included some of a yellow‑color variant.\nThe original specimen of Japanese “A. javanica” did not correspond\nmorphologically to A. kitamagotake but was determined as a yellow‑color\nvariant of A. chatamagotake. These results point to the importance of\nprecise morphological observation and molecular analysis for species\nidentification of Amanita section Caesareae that show a yellow or brown\npileus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr102788","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_102788.phy"}]}
