This Thai\nalga was identified as Volvox dissipatrix based on the delicate\ncytoplasmic bridges between somatic cells, gelatinous matrix structure,\nmonoecious sexual spheroids and the original description reporting the\nlarge asexual spheroids. Comparative analyses of light and electron\nmicroscopic features and internal transcribed spacer 2 sequences of the\nnuclear ribosomal DNA of Thai and Australian monoecious strains of V.\ndissipatrix and their closely related heterothallic strains demonstrated\nthat the latter represents a new species, Volvox zeikusii Nozaki.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Volvox dissipatrix","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_124975.phy"}]}
