Molecular\nanalyses based on newly generated ribosomal nuc-LSU and 5.8S sequences\nresolve members of section Hygrometrici to the family Physalacriaceae,\nwithin the Agaricales. The new genus Cryptomarasmius is proposed to\naccommodate members of Marasmius section Hygrometrici. Taxonomic\ntransfers of species within section Hygrometrici are recommended to\nreflect phylogenetic affinity. Fourteen species are herein formally\ncombined in Cryptomarasmius.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63190","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63190.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"96","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63189","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63189.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"278","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr63188","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_63188.phy"}]}
