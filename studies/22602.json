We propose that extreme oligotrophy\ncan be a strong barrier to immigration over geological timescales and\nfacilitate the evolution of highly coevolved and very diverse microbial\ncommunities. We show that the endangered oasis of Cuatro Ci√©negas Basin\ncan be a model for a lost world, where the ancient niche of extreme\noligotrophy favored survival of ancestral microorganisms that persisted\ndue to environmental stability and low extinction rates.\nDiversification/extinction rates in Bacillus showed several CCB endemic\nclades that diverged from the rest of Bacillus spp. in different times\nof the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, in contrast to more recent Bacillus,\nClostridium and Bacteroidetes lineages. CCB conservation is vital to the\nunderstanding of early evolutionary and ecological processes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"1284","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112170","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112170.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"275","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112292","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112292.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"188","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112323","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112323.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"115","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113877","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113877.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"130","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113876","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113876.phy"}]}
