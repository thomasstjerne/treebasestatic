The undue attention focused on their contentious\nancestral affinities (together with the ongoing debate over pinniped\norigins) has contributed, in part, to their internal phylogeny remaining\nreasonably poorly studied. Therefore, a species-level cladistic analysis\nwas undertaken to resolve the overall phylogeny of this family. All\nRecent phocid species were examined (including Monachus tropicalis),\nusing representatives of all major extant caniform lineages as\noutgroups. 168 morphological characters (primarily osteological, and\nprimarily those of the head skeleton) were examined.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A.2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phocidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3407.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5B","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phocidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3406.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5A.1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phocidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3408.phy"}]}
