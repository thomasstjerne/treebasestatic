The goals of our\nstudy were to resolve relationships among the many new generic\nsegregates of the New World genus Mascagnia, test the monophyly of the\nlargest remaining Malpighiaceae genera, and clarify the placement of Old\nWorld Malpighiaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"357","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr25785","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_25785.phy"}]}
