The mt-lsu, nuc-ssu, and\nnuc-lsu datasets suggest that Nia vibrissa is closely related to the\ncyphelloid fungus, Henningsomyces candidus, but in all three datasets\nthe monophyly of the Nia-Henningsomyces group is weakly supported.\nAnalyses of mt-ssu rDNA suggest that the sister group of Nia vibrissa is\nSchizophyllum commune, but again the relationship is weakly supported. A\ncombined analysis of all four rDNA regions strongly supports the sister\ngroup relationship of Nia vibrissa and Henningsomyces candidus.\nSchizophyllum commune and Fistulina hepatica form a strongly supported\nclade that is weakly supported as the sister group of the\nNia-Henningsomyces clade. Schizophyllum commune and Fistulina hepatica\nboth resemble cyphelloid fungi in some aspects of their hymenophore\nmorphology, and it is plausible that they could be closely related to\nHenningsomyces candidus. Eighteen genera of terrestrial gasteromycetes\nwere included in the analyses, but none are closely related to Nia\nvibrissa, which therefore represents an independent origin of the\ngasteroid habit in the homobasidiomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"112","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, nuc-ssu only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5608.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"128","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, mt-ssu only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3885.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"155","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, mt-lsu only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3886.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"158","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, nuc-lsu only","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5609.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5a","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, 4 regions MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5610.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5b","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Marine Gasteromycetes, 4 regions ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5611.phy"}]}
