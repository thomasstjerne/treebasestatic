Southern Africa has an exceptionally\ndiverse tortoise fauna, harbouring onethird of the worlds tortoise\ngenera. The distribution of Psammobates tentorius (Kuhl, 1820) covers\ntwo of the 25 biodiversity hotspots of in the world, the Succulent Karoo\nand Cape Floristic Region. The highly diverged P. tentorius represents\nan excellent model species for exploring biogeographic and radiation\npatterns of reptiles in Southern Africa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"185","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammobates tentorius Calibration","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128392.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"423","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psammobates tentorius Combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_128393.phy"}]}
