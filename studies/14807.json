The isolates exhibited resemblance to the\nmembers of C. gloeosporioides species complex based on morphology and\nwere identified as C. asianum based on 5′tef1 and Apmat sequence-data.\nThe results of pathogenicity testing validated the Kochs postulates and\nconfirmed that C. asianum is involved in mango anthracnose in South\nAfrica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105873.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105874.phy"}]}
