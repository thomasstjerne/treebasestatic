Recent collections on\nstems of a fern, Pteridium aquilinum (Dennstaedtiaceae) in Brazil, led\nto the discovery of a new species of Scirrhia, described here as S.\nbrasiliensis. Based on DNA sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal DNA\n(LSU), Scirrhia is revealed to represent a member of Dothideomycetes,\nCapnodiales, Mycosphaerellaceae. Scirrhia is the first confirmed genus\nin Mycosphaerellaceae to have well developed pseudoparaphyses and a\nprominent hypostroma in which ascomata are arranged in parallel rows.\nGiven the extremely slow growth rate and difficulty in obtaining\ncultures of S. brasiliensis on various growth media, it appears that\nScirrhia represents a genus of potentially obligate plant pathogens\nwithin Mycosphaerellaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Scirrhia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_50201.phy"}]}
