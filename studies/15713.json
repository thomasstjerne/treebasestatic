Using five\ngenomic regions (chloroplast: atpI-H, matK, psbA5â€™R-ALS-11F, rbcL;\nnuclear: LEAFY) and 30 species representing four of the five genera in\nthis tribe (Apterosperma, Camellia, Polyspora, and Pyrenaria s.l.), we\ninvestigated the phylogeny of Theeae and assessed the delimitation of\ngenera in the tribe. Our results showed that Polyspora was monophyletic\nand the sister of the three other genera of Theeae investigated,\nCamellia was paraphyletic and Pyrenaria was polyphyletic. The\ninconsistent phylogenetic placement of some species of Theeae between\nthe nuclear and chloroplast trees suggested widespread hybridization\nbetween Camellia and Pyrenaria, Polyspora and Parapyrenaria. These\nresults indicate that hybridization, rather than morphological\nhomoplasy, has confused the current classification of Theeae. In\naddition, the phylogenetic placement and possible allies of Laplacea are\nalso discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75787.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75790.phy"},{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75791.phy"},{"tree_label":"MajRule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75788.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theeae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_75789.phy"}]}
