Here we propose Tuber\npolymorphosporum and T. baoshanense as new species. These species are\ndescribed from Yunnan Province and differ in a combination of\nmorphologically features including ascoma color, peridium structure and\nascospore shape and size. These two new taxa have phylogenetic affinity\nto T. latisporum and T. alboumbilicum, respectively, described from the\nsouthwest China. Phylogenetic placement of these novel Tuber species in\nthe Latisporum group are presented here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99626","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_99626.phy"}]}
