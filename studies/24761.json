It is characterized by small to middle size\nbasidiomata, applanate to papilla pileus covered by greyish orange to\nviolet brown fibrillose-squamules, white to dark green lamellae with\nage, white stipe covered by violet brown squamules, lamellae and stipe\nchange from white to pinkish white when injured, white membranous and\ninconspicuous annulus, ellipsoid to oblong basidiospores and cutis\npileipellis. Phylogenetic analyses based on the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region and the large subunit (LSU) of the nuclear ribosomal\nDNA also support to identify it as a new species in Xanthagaricus.\nIllustrations of macro- and micromorphological characters, descriptions\nand phylogenetic placement of X. siamensis are provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118935","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118935.phy"}]}
