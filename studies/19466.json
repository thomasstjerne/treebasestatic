In Europe, Portugal and Spain have the highest cetacean\nstranding rates, mostly due to the vast extension of coastline.\nMorbillivirus infection has been associated with high morbidity and\nmortality in cetaceans, especially in outbreaks reported in the\nMediterranean Sea. However, scarce information is available regarding\nthis disease in cetaceans from the North-East Atlantic populations. The\npresence of CeMV genomic RNA was investigated by reverse\ntranscription-quantitative PCR in samples from 279 specimens stranded\nalong the Portuguese and Galician coastlines collected between 2004 and\n2015. A total of sixteen animals (n=16/279, 5.7%) were positive. The\nhighest prevalence of DMV was registered in striped dolphins (Stenella\ncoeruleoalba) (n=14/69; 20.3%), slightly higher in those collected in\nGalicia (n=8/33; 24.2%) than in Portugal (n=6/36; 16.7%). Phylogenetic\nanalysis revealed that, despite the low genetic distances between\nsamples, the high posterior probability (PP) values obtained strongly\nsupport the separation of the Portuguese and Galician sequences in an\nindependent branch, separately from samples from the Mediterranean and\nthe Canary Islands.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96838","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96838.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dolphin morbillivirus AA concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96840.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96841","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96841.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dolphin morbillivirus P gene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96837.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr96839","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_96839.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dolphin morbillivirus DNA concatenated","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_96842.phy"}]}
