Kawai and P. pavonicoides Ni-Ni-Win et\nH. Kawai. They are 2 to 3-layered and 3-layered species, respectively.\nPadina ditristromatica is characterized by a thallus composed of two\ncell layers from the marginal portion to the inrolled margin and a\nmixture of two and three layers in the other portions, heavy\ncalcification on both surfaces of the thallus except for the hair lines,\nthe alternating hair lines arranged in unequal distance between both\nsurfaces, and broad indusiate oogonial and tetrasporangial sori forming\nbroken lines or patches arranged in a concentric row, which are distally\nclose to the hair lines and half immersed in the epidermis layer only on\nthe inferior surface. Padina pavonicoides is characterized by a thallus\ncomposed of three cell layers from the base to the marginal portion and\ntwo layers at the inrolled margin, the alternating hair lines arranged\nin equal distance between both surfaces, and indusiate oogonial and\ntetrasporangial sori forming patches located distal to the hair lines\nonly on the inferior surface. All molecular phylogenetic analyses\nindicated that they are closely related to P. pavonica (Linnaeus) Thivy,\na common species in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the cox3 region\ncould not be amplified for P. ditristromatica. Therefore, the RuBisCO\nspacer and partial rbcS were analysed for the Mediterranean specimens in\norder to confirm their identity as well as their closest relationship.\nThe combined rbcL, RuBisCO spacer and partial rbcS data also supports\ntheir genetic separation and shows that P. pavonica is more closely\nrelated to P. pavonicoides than P. ditristromatica as in other molecular\nanalyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"BI cox3 Lobophora Stypopodium","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47065.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML cox3 Lobophora Stypopodium","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47064.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML rbcL spacer rbcS","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47070.phy"},{"tree_label":"BI rbcL-cox3 Lobophora Stypopodium","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47068.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML rbcL four outgroups","ntax":"38","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47071.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML rbcL Lobophora Stypopodium 36","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47066.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML rbcL-cox3 Homoeostrichus Distromium+","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47067.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML rbcL-cox3 Lobophora Stypopodium","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Dictyotales","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47069.phy"}]}
