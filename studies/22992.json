ITS sequence analyses\nshow that this species has phylogenetic affinity to other Tuber species\nin the Rufum clade and is apparently endemic to the Pacific Northwestern\nregion of the USA and adjacent Canada. The only other member of the\nRufum clade with a strongly developed peridium of large, inflated cells\nis the southern European T. malacodermum. A diagnosis of its type\ncollection is presented for comparison with T. luomae. The holotype of\nT. malacodermum is more than a century old and was preserved in ethanol,\nbut a recent collection from Spain yielded good DNA for sequencing.\nPhylogenetic analysis shows these two species on different branches\nwithin the Rufum clade.","trees":[{"tree_label":"1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr112567","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_112567.phy"}]}
