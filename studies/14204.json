Recently, Psilocybe also\nincluded non-hallucinogenic species that have since been shifted to the\ngenus Deconica. Here, we reconstruct a multigene phylogeny for\nPsilocybe, Deconica, and other exemplars of the families\nHymenogastraceae and Strophariaceae sensu stricto (s. str.), using three\nnuclear markers (nLSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and rpb1). Our results confirm\nthe monophyly of Deconica within Stropha- riaceae s. str., as well as\nnumerous robust infrageneric relationships. Psilocybe is also recovered\nas a monophyletic group in the Hymenogastraceae, in which two principal\nlineages are recognized, including several nested subgroups. Most\nsections of Psilocybe following classifications based on morphological\nfeatures are not supported in these analyses. Ancestral character state\nreconstruction analyses suggest that basidiospore shape in frontal view\nand spore wall thickness, commonly used to characterize sections in\nDeconica and Psilocybe, are homoplastic. Chrysocystidia, sterile cells\nlocated in the hymenium, evolved on at least two occasions in the\nStrophariaceae s. str., including in a novel lineage of Deconica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Psilocybe sensu lato","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_103255.phy"}]}
