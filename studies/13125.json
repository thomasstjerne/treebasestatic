Historically, the identity and diversity of\nsouthwestern tyrannosauroids was unclear because most of the fossils\nwere isolated teeth and bones that are not diagnostic of known genera or\nspecies (Carr and Williamson, 2000). One partial skull and skeleton\n(OMNH 10131) from the upper Campanian of New Mexico was referred to the\nproblematic tooth taxon Aublysodon cf.Â A. mirandus, a referral that was\nlater falsified (Lehman and Carpenter, 1990; Carr and Williamson, 2004).\nRecently, two fairly complete skulls and skeletons were collected that\nenabled a review of tyrannosauroid fossils from the Campanian of New\nMexico. These specimens provide the opportunity to accurately\ncharacterize Campanian tyrannosauroids of the southwest, and recover\ntheir phylogenetic relationships with well-known species (Carr and\nWilliamson, 2000). We report the presence of a new genus and species of\ndeep-snouted tyrannosauroid from the upper Campanian of New Mexico,\nrepresented by several specimens including the partial skeleton of an\nadult and a juvenile. This new taxon is part of the diversification of\ndeep-snouted tyrannosauroids and emphasizes the high species richness of\nthis widespread clade in the upper Campanian of western North\nAmerica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 4","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tyrannosaurid phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55550.phy"}]}
