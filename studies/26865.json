Multi-locus sequence analyses of the\nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and parts of Alternaria\nmajor allergen (Alt a 1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(GAPDH), second largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II (RPB2) and\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) genes revealed the presence\nof two previously known species, A. scirpivora and A. caricicola and\nthree new species, which are described here as A. cypericola, A.\nheyranica and A. junci-acuti spp. nov.. These new species were\ncharacterized morphologically with respect to the dimensions of conidia,\nthe number of pseudosepta in mature conidia and the type of conidium\napical beak. According to the results of phylogenetic analyses, the\npresence of long filiform true beak is not a reliable morphological\nindicator for grouping species in sections Alternantherae and Nimbya and\nphylogenetic species recognition should be used. All identified species\nwere described, illustrated and their morphology and phylogenetic\nrelationships with other species in Alternaria section Nimbya were\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr130636","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_130636.phy"}]}
