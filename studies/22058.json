The annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus\ninhabits ephemeral ponds in northern Venezuela, South America, and is an\nemerging extremophile model for vertebrate diapause, stress tolerance,\nand evolution. Embryos of A. limnaeus regularly experience extended\nperiods of desiccation and anoxia as a part of their natural history and\nhave unique metabolic and developmental adaptations. Currently, there\nare limited genomic resources available for gene expression and\nevolutionary studies that can take advantage of A. limnaeus as a unique\nmodel system.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Austrofundulus limnaeus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_109263.phy"}]}
