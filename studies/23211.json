Three data partitions: complete plastomes, rare\ngenomic changes (RGC), and a combined plastome and RGC data matrix were\nanalyzed. Overall, 175 RGC events were identified, and 156 non-ambiguous\nRGC were analyzed, of which 36 individual synapomorphic RGC were\nidentified and attributed to the Group 1 subtribes: Aveninae,\nAgrostidinae, and Anthoxanthinae; and the Group 2 subtribes: Loliinae,\nAmmochloinae, Parapholiinae, Dactylidinae, Poinae, and Coleanthinae.\nThere were two RGC events which convergence/parallelism was seen in our\ntrees. Two other RGC originated through intrastrand deletion events. The\nremaining RGC events likely originated through recombination given their\nsize and lack of sequence evidence for other types of mutations. This\nstudy also determined that relationships between taxa, even those only\nweakly supported in previous studies, could be inferred with strong\nsupport when utilizing complete plastomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr113368","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_113368.phy"}]}
