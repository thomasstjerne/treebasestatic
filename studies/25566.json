A sequence\nanalysis of genome ribosomal DNA showed that this rust fungus\ngenetically matches Stereostratum corticioides, a causative agent of\nculm rust disease of bamboos and broadleaf bamboos. Inoculation\nexperiments and further nucleotide sequence analyses that included\nadditional fungal material showed that Aecidium sp. is conspecific with\nS. corticioides, a species whose spermogonial and aecial stages were\npreviously unknown. Thus, we demonstrated heteroecism in S. corticioides\nfor the first time. We also propose that the binomial Puccinia\ncorticioides should be revived to replace Stereostratum\ncorticioides.","trees":[{"tree_label":"NJtree","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr121304","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_121304.phy"},{"tree_label":"MLTREE","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr122385","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_122385.phy"}]}
