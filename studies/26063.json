A molecular phylogeny based on\nthe nuclear large subunit of rDNA (nucLSU), the mitochondrial small\nsubunit of rDNA (mtSSU) and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha\ngene (TEF1) revealed three novel species within the clade of\nConidiobolus s.s., i.e. C. bifurcatus sp. nov., C. taihushanensis sp.\nnov. and C. variabilis sp. nov. These three species were isolated from\nplant debris in eastern China. Morphologically, C. bifurcatus sp. nov.\nis characterised by its secondary conidiophores often branched at the\ntip to form two short stipes each bearing a secondary conidium. C.\ntaihushanensis sp. nov. is different from the others in its straight\napical mycelia and the production of 25 conidia. C. variabilis sp. nov.\nis distinctive because of its various shapes of primary conidia. All\nthese three new taxa are illustrated herein with an update key to the\nspecies of the genus Conidiobolus s.s.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MLT","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Conidiobolus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122927.phy"}]}
