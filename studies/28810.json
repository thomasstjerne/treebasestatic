In this study, six new species from central Vietnam in Southeast\nAsia, T. bidoupensis, T. brevisterigmata, T. cinereobrunnea, T.\nlongiechinula, T. stipitobasidia and T. verruculata, are described and\nillustrated based on morphological characteristics and molecular\nphylogenetic analyses of the nuclear ribosomal ITS (internal transcribed\nspacer: ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and LSU (large sub-unit: 28S) markers. Maximum\nlikelihood and Bayesian analyses were used to confirm the phylogenetic\nposi-tions of these new species and all of them can be well recognized\nby the macroscopical and ana-tomical characteristics. The new species\nand closely related species in the phylogenetic tree, and the new\nspecies and morphologically similar species are discussed, and the host\nplant for these new species have been speculating based on the\nphylogenetic analysis and the tree species information of the\ninvestigated forests.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"276","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133779","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133779.phy"}]}
