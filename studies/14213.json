Guignardia) have\nbeen described from orchids worldwide. A new species, Phyllosticta\nspeewahensis, is proposed for a specimen isolated from leaf spots on a\nhybrid Vanda orchid in northern Queensland, Australia. Phylogenetic\nanalysis of the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and\npartial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) gene sequences\nshowed that P. speewahensis is most closely related to P. hostae. The\nlikelihood that orchids harbour further cryptic species of endophytic\nand pathogenic Phyllosticta species is discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta spp. on orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63496.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta spp. on orchids","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_63719.phy"}]}
