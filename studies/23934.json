Strobilomyces minor is characterized by its small basidiomes,\nlight yellowish-brown appressed pyramidal scales on the pileus and\nstipe, large hymenophoral pores, reticulate basidiospores with large\nmeshes. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses based on four gene\nmarkers (rpb1, rpb2, tef1 and cox3) as well as morphological characters\nconfirmed that this new taxon belongs to Strobilomyces and it is\ndistinct from any known species. A morphological description with line\ndrawings and SEM images for the species is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr115786","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_115786.phy"}]}
