Phylloporia crystallina is characterized by\npileate and perennial basidiocarps with duplex context, small pores 910\nper mm, a monomitic hyphal system, the absence of cystidia and\ncystidioles, the presence of large rhomboid crystals in tube trama,\nbroadly ellipsoid basidiospores to subglobose measuring 2.83 × 22.3 μm,\nand growth on angiosperm stump. Phylloporia sumacoensis is characterized\nby pileate and perennial basidiocarps with duplex context, very small\npores 1012 per mm, a monomitic hyphal system, hyphae at dissepiment\nedges bearing fine crystals, the presence of cystidioles, broadly\nellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores measuring 33.7 × 2.12.8 μm, and\ngrowth on living liana. The samples of the two new species nested in the\nPhylloporia clade by the nuc 28S rDNA-based phylogeny, forming two new\nterminal lineages.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"135","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136211","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136211.phy"}]}
