The Morphological characteristics of the fungus suggested it\nwas a member of the Helotiales rather than the Rhytismatales and this\nwas supported by a phylogenetic analysis. Based on a morphological\ncomparison with the type specimen of Naemacyclus culmigenus, currently\nknown from Poaceae (Andropogon and Panicum), it was identified as N.\nculmigenus, new to Japan. The molecular phylogenetic analysis showed\nthat the generic delimitation of Naemacyclcus and related species\nrequires clarification, as does their higher classification within the\nLeotiomycetes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr60578","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_60578.phy"}]}
