Colletotrichum truncatum is the\nmost common and usual causal agent of chili anthracnose. In this study,\nanthracnose-infected fruits were collected from two states in Malaysia\n(Selangor and Perak) and the isolates obtained were subjected to\nmicroinjection method to validate KochÂ’s postulates. Disease assessment\nfor anthracnose was evaluated after 10 days of inoculation and five\npotential isolates with anthracnose lesion greater than 15% were\nselected to further molecular confirmation using PCR protocol. The\nphylogenetic analyses from DNA sequence data based on the internal\ntranscribed spacer (ITS) regions clearly identified the pathogenic\nisolates as C. truncatum, C. sojae, and C. fructicola with bootstrap\nsupport 100%, and 98% respectively. Among 13 chili genotypes tested, two\nAVRDC improved lines, AVPP0514 and AVPP0805 showed resistant (<2%\nanthracnose lesion) against all Colletotrichum species complex isolated\nfrom this study.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML Tree","ntax":"42","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"A Maximum Likelihood (ML) inference phylogenetic tree\nusing ITS region of Colletotrichum and references","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_114785.phy"}]}
