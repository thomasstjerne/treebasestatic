They were characterized using conidiomatal\nmorphology, conidial dimensions, colony appearance and growth rate, and\nsequences of ITS rDNA. Based on morphological and molecular\nsimilarities, most isolates grouped together with an authentic culture\nof Phomopsis vaccinii Shear. This taxon is described and illustrated.\nHowever, some Phomopsis isolates from Vaccinium differed in colony and\nconidiomatal morphology from P. vaccinii and, based on ITS sequences,\nwere related to isolates of Phomopsis from diverse hosts. These isolates\nwere excluded from P. vaccinii.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"70","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phomopsis ITS bootstrap tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1195.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"P. vaccinii ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1196.phy"}]}
