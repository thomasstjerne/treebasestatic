Although\nmost of the 600 species of tree ferns are arborescent, the group\nencompasses a wide range of morphological variability, from diminutive\nmembers to the giant scaly tree ferns, Cyatheaceae. This well-known\nfamily comprises most of the tree fern diversity (~500 species) and is\nwidespread in tropical, subtropical, and south temperate regions of the\nworld. Here we investigate the phylogenetic relationships of scaly tree\nferns based on DNA sequence data from five plastid regions (rbcL,\nrbcL-accD IGS, rbcL-atpB IGS, trnG-trnR, and trnL-trnF). A basal\ndichotomy resolves Sphaeropteris as sister to all other taxa and scale\nfeatures support these two clades: Sphaeropteris has conform scales,\nwhereas all other taxa have marginate scales. The marginate-scaled clade\nconsists of a basal trichotomy, with the three groups here termed (1)\nCyathea (including Cnemidaria, Hymenophyllopsis, Trichipteris), (2)\nAlsophila sensu stricto, and (3) Gymnosphaera (previously recognized as\na section within Alsophila) + A. capensis. Scaly tree ferns display a\nwide range of indusial structures, and although the indusium shape is\nhomoplastic it does contain useful phylogenetic information that\nsupports some of the larger clades recognised.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyatheaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2736.phy"}]}
