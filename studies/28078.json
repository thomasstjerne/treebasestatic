Species identification is currently based on\nthree genetic markers, viz., the internal transcribed spacer regions\n(ITS) of the rDNA, and partial fragments of actin (act) and the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) genes. Using this phylogenetic\napproach and from morphological differences, we have recognized six new\nspecies originating from soil, herbivore dung and plant material\ncollected at different Spanish locations. They are proposed as\nCladosporium caprifimosum, C. coprophilum, C. fuscoviride and C.\nlentulum belonging in the C. cladosporioides species complex, and C.\npseudotenellum and C. submersum belonging in the C. herbarum species\ncomplex. This study revealed that herbivore dung represented a reservoir\nof novel lineages in the genus Cladosporium.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"103","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133914.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cladosporium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_133913.phy"}]}
