The present work\ncharacterizes the mycobiota associated with dead woody twigs found in\nterrestrial habitats in the Kunming area of Yunnan. Of additional\ninterest is that the samples discussed in this man-uscript were all\ncollected by the 5-year-old son of one of the authors. The taxonomic\nnovelties were recognized based on morphological comparisons coupled\nwith phylogenetic analyses of multiple gene sequences (non-translated\nloci and protein-coding regions). Neokalmusia jonahhulmei sp. nov. is\nintroduced in Didymosphaeriaceae (Pleosporales) as a woody-based\nsaprobic ascomycete that pos-sesses multiloculate ascostromata immersed\nunder a black clypeus-like structure, subglobose to ampulliform locules,\nan ascostromatal wall with thin-walled cells of textura angularis,\ncylindrical to clavate, short pedicellate asci with furcate ends, and\n3-septate, brown, fusiform, guttulate as-cospores. Thyridaria\njonahhulmei (Thyridariaceae) is introduced with sexual and asexual\n(coelomy-cetous) features. The sexual morph is characterized by globose\nto subglobose, ostiolate ascomata, a pruinose layer of yellow to reddish\nor orange-brown material forming around the apices of the ostiolar\nnecks, a peridium with textura angularis cells, cylindrical to\ncylindric-clavate asci with a long pedicel and an ocular chamber, brown,\nellipsoid to fusoid, 2Â–3-septate, euseptate, rough-walled guttulate\nascospores, and the asexual morph is featured by pycnidial conidiomata,\nphialidic, ampulliform to doliiform, hyaline, flexuous and smooth\nconidiogenous cells, brown, guttulate, ellipsoidal and aseptate\nconidia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Didymosphaeriaceae","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136109","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136109.phy"},{"tree_label":"Thyridariaceae","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr136110","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_136110.phy"}]}
