The fungus was associated with dying branches\nand stems on S. cordatum, H. canescens and T. granulosa. However,\nmorphological differences were detected between the unknown fungus from\nthese three hosts and known species of Chrysoporthe. The aim of this\nstudy was to characterise the fungus using DNA sequence comparisons and\nmorphological features. Pathogenicity tests were also conducted to\nassess its virulence on Eucalyptus (ZG 14 clones), H. natalensis and T.\ngranulosa. Plants of H. canescens were not available for inoculation.\nResults showed distinct morphological differences between the unknown\nfungus and Chrysoporthe spp. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates\nreside in a clade separate from Chrysoporthe and other related genera.\nCeloporthe dispersa gen. et sp. nov. is, therefore, described to\naccommodate this fungus. Pathogenicity tests showed that C. dispersa is\nnot pathogenic to H. natalensis, but that it is a potential pathogen of\nEucalyptus and Tibouchina spp.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"33","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"ITS and B-tubulin","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2435.phy"}]}
