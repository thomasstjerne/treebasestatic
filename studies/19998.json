The acidification of surface water that can occur after acid\nsulfate material in soils and sediments is oxidised and subsequently\nre-wetted is a serious environmental issue in coastal regions and inland\nriverine floodplains worldwide. Solubilisation of soil-associated\nminerals can result in high waterborne concentrations of mineral salts\nand dissolved metals, which together with low pH represent a potential\nthreat to aquatic ecosystems in affected regions. The aims of the\npresent study were to gain insight into stress responses induced by\nexposure to acid drainage water (ADW) in P. australiensis by determining\nchanges in the abundance of protein-coding transcripts and to generate a\ncomprehensive transcriptomic resource to facilitate further research\ninto gene regulation or protein structure and function in this species.\nAdult P. australiensis were exposed for 24 h to undiluted ADW, 50% ADW\ndiluted in river water, or to river water as control, and\nhigh-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) conducted on whole-body\ntissues. A reference transcriptome was generated using de novo assembly\nand putative protein-coding regions were identified and annotated.\nChanges in transcript abundance in response to ADW exposure were\ndetermined by aligning reads to the reference transcriptome and\nquantifying coverage. Results: A high proportion of arthropod\nbenchmarking universal single-copy orthologues were present in the\nreference transcriptome. Functions associated with cuticle biosynthesis\nand oxidative stress were significantly enriched in the lists of\ntranscripts exhibiting differential abundance in either direction after\nexposure to 50% or 100% ADW. Transcripts involved in osmoregulation\nexhibited decreased abundance following exposure to ADW. The\ntranscriptome contained full-length coding sequences for numerous\nproteins known to be involved in environmental response pathways,\nincluding two putative metallothioneins, four glutathione peroxidases\nand 19 nuclear receptors. Conclusions: The results of the present study\nprovide insight into stress response pathways induced in crustaceans by\nshort-term exposure to multiple stressors present in ADW such as low pH,\nhigh salinity and dissolved metals, and represent a resource for future\ntoxicogenomics and protein functional studies in P. australiensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree
