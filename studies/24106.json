The ascomycete C. paspali is known as the main responsible for\nthis disease in both grasses. This fungus produces alkaloids including\nergot alkaloids (EAs) and indole diterpenes (IDT) which have potent\nneurotropic activities in mammals. A total of 32 isolates from Uruguay\nwere obtained from infected P. dilatatum and P. plicatulum. Isolates\nwere phylogenetically identified using sequences of the translation\nelongation factor 1-alfa and the beta tubulin genes, genotyped with RAPD\nand markers representing peripheral genes within the EA and IDT alkaloid\nbiosynthetic clusters, and their alkaloid potential was predicted. The\nresults from this study provide insight into the genotypic and\nchemotypic diversity of Claviceps paspali present in P. dilatatum and\nsuggest that isolates from P. plicatulum could be considered an\necological subspecies or specialized variant of C. paspali. Some of\nthese isolates show hypothetical alkaloid profiles never reported\nbefore.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr116405","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_116405.phy"}]}
