Because of the growing popularity of the\nsupertree methods, it has become necessary to evaluate the performance\nof these algorithms to determine which are the best options (especially\nin regard of the supermatrix approach which is widely used). In this\nstudy, seven of the most commonly used supertree methods are\ninvestigated by using a large empirical dataset (in terms of number of\ntaxa and molecular markers) from the worldwide flowering plant family\nSapindaceae. Supertree methods were evaluated using several criteria:\nsimilarity of the supertrees with the input trees, similarity between\nthe supertrees and the total evidence tree, level of resolution of the\nsupertree and the computational time required by the algorithm.\nAdditional analyses were also conducted on a reduced dataset to test if\nthe performance levels were affected by the heuristic searches rather\nthan the algorithms themselves. Based on our results, two main groups of\nsupertree methods were identified: on one hand, the Matrix\nRepresentation with Parsimony (MRP), MinFlip and MinCut methods\nperformed well according to our criteria, whereas the Average Consensus,\nSplit Fit and Most Similar Supertree methods showed a poorer\nperformance, or at least did not behave the same way as the total\nevidence tree. Results for the Super Distance Matrix (SDM), i.e., the\nmost recent approach tested here, were promising with at least one\nderived method performing as well as MRP, MinFlip and MinCut. The output\nof each method was only slightly improved when applied to the reduced\ndataset, suggesting a correct behaviour of the heuristic searches and a\nrelatively low sensitivity of the algorithms to dataset sizes and\nmissing data. Results also showed that the MRP analyses could reach a\nhigh level of quality even when using a simple heuristic search\nstrategy, with the exception of MRP with Purvis coding scheme and\nreversible parsimony. The future of supertrees lies in the\nimplementation of a standardised heuristic search for all methods and\nthe increase in computing power to handle large datasets. The latter\nwould prove to be particularly useful for promising approaches such as\nthe Maximum Quartet fit method that yet requires substantial computing\npower.","trees":[{"tree_label":"MRPBRrevnodes","ntax":"243","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Soapberry Family","tree_kind":"Species
