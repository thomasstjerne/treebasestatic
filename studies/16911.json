Different views have been postulated from\nphylogeographic studies in understanding the historical biological\nevents shaping present-day distributions and species diversities in this\narea. We analyzed the phylogeography of Rosa soulieana, a widely\ndistributed rose species in dry and semi-dry valleys of the Hengduan\nMountains of southwestern China using two cpDNA intergenic spacers. 9\ncpDNA haplotypes were confirmed in 650 individuals from 39 populations,\nwith the most dominant one existing in 36 populations. The relationship\namong the cpDNA haplotypes did not reflect the morphology-based\nintra-specific taxonomy of different varieties. There was very low cpDNA\ngenetic diversity and relatively high population differentiation\ncombined with lack of phylogeographic structure. The populations from\nNorthwestern Yunnan, Southeastern Tibet and upper Yalongjiang River\nembraced most of the species genetic diversity, but with contribution of\ndifferent historical effects. Northwestern Yunnan and upper Yalongjiang\nRiver appear to be the species refugia and centers of adaptive\ndiversification, while Southeastern Tibet rather represents the species\nâmelting potâ in the Quaternary climate oscillations.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 21","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeography of Rosa soulieana","tree_kind":"Species
