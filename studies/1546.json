It was previously thought to be\nmonotypic with a disjunct distribution on the Yucatan Peninsula and\nalong the Pacific coast in Jalisco and Sinaloa. There is some question\nabout whether Adelia and Enriquebeltrania should be treated as distinct.\nMorphological and molecular characters (trnL-F spacer and rbcL DNA\nsequences) were utilized in phylogenetic analyses to determine if\nEnriquebeltrania belongs to the tribe Adelieae, to test whether should\nbe recognized as a genus separate from Adelia, and to determine the\nnumber of species that should be recognized. Results indicate that\nEnriquebeltrania does not belong to tribe Adelieae, that it should be\nrecognized as a genus separate from Adelia, and that it consists of two\nspecies. The second species, Enriquebeltrania disjuncta, is named and\ndescribed here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enriquebeltrania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2439.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enriquebeltrania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2438.phy"},{"tree_label":"morphology consensus","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Enriquebeltrania","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2440.phy"}]}
