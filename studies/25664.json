Morphological observations\nshowed these three species share similar characteristics by having\nsolitary, simple, fleshy stroma, completely immersed perithecia and\ncylindrical asci with thickened cap and filiform ascospores that often\ndisarticulate at maturity. Phylogenetic analysis of combined LSU, SSU,\nTEF, RPB1, RPB2 and ITS sequence data together with morphological\ncharacteristics showed that the three entomopathogenic fungi are new\nspecies belong to the genus Paraisaria. The new species were named as\nParaisaria alba and P. arcta and P. rosea. Comprehensive descriptions,\ncolour photographs and a phylogenetic tree to show the position of the\nnew species in Ophiocordycipitaceae are provided. A synopsis table and a\nkey to all treated species of Paraisaria are also included.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Paraisaria","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_121830.phy"}]}
