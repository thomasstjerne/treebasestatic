In this work, we isolated leaf\nendophytic fungi from Serjania laruotteana, identify them using\nmultilocus analysis, and evaluate the genetic variability using IRAP\n(Inter-Retrotransposon Amplified Polymorphism) and REMAP\n(Retrotransposon-Microssatellite Amplified Polymorphism). A total of 261\nfungi were isolated and 58 were identified. Multilocus phylogenetic\nanalysis using the partial sequences from the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions,\nelongation factor 1-alpha, β-tubulin, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\ndehydrogenase, and calmodulin genes identify that most strains belonged\nto the Colletotrichum and Diaporthe genera, other isolated genera were\nXylaria, Phyllosticta, Muyocopron, Fusarium, Nemania, Plectosphaerella,\nCorynespora, Bipolaris, and Curvularia. The IRAP and REMAP analyzes were\nperformed with Colletotrichum and Diaporthe genera and showed 100% of\npolymorphism and high intra- and interspecific variability. This is the\nfirst report of the diversity of endophytic fungi from S. laruotteana.\nIn addition, it demonstrated that the IRAP and REMAP can be used to\ndistinguish morphologically similar lineages, revealing differences even\nstrains of the same species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"consensus","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr132700","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_132700.phy"}]}
