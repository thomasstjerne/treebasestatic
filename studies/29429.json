In morphological\nanalysis, R. atrofuscus is characterized by its dark gray to black\npileus, white to pale yellowish white hymenophore, white to grayish\nwhite or pale yellow context, turning orange-yellow to rusty yellow when\ninjured, white to pale yellow to black stipe, prominently and coarsely\nreticulate over the upper 3/4 or overall. In phylogenetic analysis, the\nspecimens from Huanggang Mountain, grouped together with R. fuscus, but\nthey are obviously separated, and have some morphological differences.\nR. fuscus has white context, and changing to pale brown when injured,\nthinner pileipellis. Descriptions and hand drawings of the new species\nand comparisons with similar species are shown below.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135693","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135693.phy"}]}
