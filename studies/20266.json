This species is characterized by very small size\nof basidiocarp with long hair on the stipe and ornamented spores. Both\nmorphological distinctiveness and phylogenetic separation based upon\nanalyses of nrDNA ITS sequences support the establishment of this new\nspecies. Anatomical dissimilarities between C. minuscula and close\nspecies are discussed. Notes on a new record of C. aff. subglobosa, are\nincluded.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101618","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101618.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101623","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_101623.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr101620","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_101620.phy"}]}
