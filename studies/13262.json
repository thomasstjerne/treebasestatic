S. langhami is a member\nof Tyrannosauroidea, showing a distinct median vertical ridge on the\nlateral surface of the ilium, a prominent shelf medial to the\npreacetabular notch, a pronounced ischial tubercle, and a tibia that is\nelongate relative to the femur. One of only two definitive Jurassic\ntyrannosauroids known from more than isolated elements, it is the\nlargest Jurassic tyrannosauroid reported to date and provides additional\nevidence for the presence of relatively small- or medium-sized basal\ntyrannosauroids in Asia, North America, and Europe during the Late\nJurassic. The occurrence of Stokesosaurus in the Tithonian of theUKand\nUSA and the absence of tyrannosauroids in contemporaneous west African\nfaunas supports the hypothesis of a paleobiogeographic link during the\nLate Jurassic between North America and Europe, to the exclusion of\nAfrica.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 13","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Theropoda phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56088.phy"}]}
