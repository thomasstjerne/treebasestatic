DNA sequencing and cluster analysis\nwere used to identify the taxa of fungi present in 74 root tips\ncollected from the canopy soil microhabitat of three old-growth\nNothofagus menziesii trees in the South West New Zealand World Heritage\nArea. A diverse assemblage of ectomycorrhizal fungi was found to infect\nan extensive network of adventitious canopy roots of Nothofagus\nmenziesii in this old-growth forest, including 14 phylotypes across 9\ngenera of putative ectomycorrhizal fungi. Canopy ectomycorrhizas provide\nan unexpected means for increased host nutrition that may have\nfunctional significance in some forest ecosystems. Presumably, canopy\nectomycorrhizas circumvent the treegroundsoil nutrient cycle by\naccessing a wider range of nutrients directly in the canopy than would\nbe possible for non-mycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal canopy roots.\nIn this system, both host and epiphytes would seem to be in competition\nfor the same pool of nutrients in canopy soil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nothofagus trnL-trnF result","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_53052.phy"}]}
