Morphological characteristics\ndemonstrated that these taxa are typical of Cytospora in forming\nmulti-loculate, ento-stromatic conidiomata, branched or unbranched\nconidiophores, with enteroblastic, phialidic co-nidiogenous cells and\nhyaline, allantoid, aseptate conidia. Multiloci phylogeny of ITS, LSU,\nACT, RPB2, TEF1-α and TUB2 confirmed these taxa are distinct new species\nin Cytospora in Cytosporaceae (Diaporthales, Sordariomycetes)\nviz. Cytospora chiangmaiensis, C. phitsanulokensis and C. shoreae.\nCytospora chiangmaiensis has a close phylogenetic relationship with C.\nshoreae, while C. phitsanu-lokensis is sister to C. acaciae. These three\nnovel species were also preliminary screened for their antagonistic\nactivity against five plant pathogenic fungi: Colletotrichum fructicola,\nCo. siamense, Co. artocarpicola, Co. viniferum and Fusarium sambucinum.\nCytospora shoreae and C. phitsanulokensis showed >60% inhibition\nagainst Co. viniferum and F. sambucinum while, C. chiangmaiensis had\nmoderate inhibition activity against all pathogens.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"120","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133742","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133742.phy"}]}
