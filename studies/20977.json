This combination of molecular\nand phylogenetic sampling is used to reconstruct the cosmopolitan\nradiation of lobeliads, with special focus on the origin of the giant\nlobelias.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Chronogram","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lobelia Chronogram","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105654.phy"},{"tree_label":"BestTree","ntax":"79","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lobelia ML","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_105653.phy"}]}
