Little is known about fungal diseases affecting\nthis species, although these represent a known limitation for its\ncultivation in nurseries. Among these there is a foliage blight that\noccurs in combination with distortion of branch apices and die-back. A\nconsistent association of a species of Pilidiella with the diseased\ntissues was observed. The fungus was isolated in pure culture and based\non its morphology and DNA phylogeny, we conclude that it represents a\nnew species, for which the name Pilidiella tibouchinae is\nintroduced.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pilidiella tibouchinae, LSU (28S nrDNA) alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56337.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"25","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pilidiella tibouchinae, ITS nrDNA alignment","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56336.phy"}]}
