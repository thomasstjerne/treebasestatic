The new species is distinct from other species in\nSulcatisporaceae, as it has dematiaceous dictyosporous conidia. It\ndiffers from Magnicamarosporium iriomotense in its smaller conidiomata\nand conidia. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analysis of\ncombined LSU, SSU, ITS, and TEF1-Î± sequence data indicate that M.\ndiospyricola is a well-resolved species, sister to M. iriomotense, in\nthe family Sulcatisporaceae. The morphology and phylogenetic placement\nof the new species are discussed in this paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr106420","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_106420.phy"}]}
