They compose a traditional\nstable taxon recently supported as monophyletic but characterized by\nplesiomorphies. Most genera within the family have been recovered as\nparaphyletic in previous studies. We present a phylogenetic hypothesis\nfor eunicid based on molecular (COI, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA) and\nmorphological data (213 characters), including an explicit attempt to\naccount for serial homology. Eunicidae as well as monophyletic genera\nMarphysa sensu stricto and Lysidice are redefined based on\nsynapomorphies. Nematonereis is synonymized to Lysidice. Leodice and\nNicidion are resurrected to name monophyletic groups including species\npreviously included in Eunice and Marphysa sensu lato. Traditional\ndiagnostic characters such as the absence/presence of peristomial cirri,\nlateral antennae and branchiae are homoplasies and not informative at\nthe generic level. Different coding of traditional characters (i.e.,\narticulation of prostomial appendages) and novel characters of\nprostomial features and regionalization of the body support the\nmonophyly of the family and genera level clades.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67537.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67538.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hennig 1+","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67541.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hennig 1+","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67539.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hennig 1+","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67540.phy"},{"tree_label":"Hennig 1+","ntax":"72","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Eunicidae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_67542.phy"}]}
