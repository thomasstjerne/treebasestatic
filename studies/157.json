The cupules at the base of the stamens and the long,\nnarrow, moderately flattened seeds are unique. Cladistic analysis\nsupports the hypothesis that leaf idioblasts with randomly oriented\nstyloids (leaves scabrous when dry), root styloids, sessile anthers, and\ninaperturate pollen are synapomorphies with the widespread, monospecific\nEvodianthus. The new genus differs fundamentally from Evodianthus by\nhaving a uniseriate staminate perianth and in seed shape and seed coat\nstructure. Dianthoveus shares additional uncommon characters with\nEvodianthus (e.g., separate fruits, terminal inflorescences, symmetrical\nflowers) that are not unique in the family. With Schultesiophyturn it\nshares some of these uncommon characters but uniquely shares only\nlaminar anther appendages. Although Dianthoveus and Dicranopygium\nsubgenus Gleasonianthus uniquely share staminate flowers with eglandular\ntepals, no other characters suggest a close relationship between\nthem.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 11","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cyclanthaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1605.phy"}]}
