The holotype was found in\nLate CenomanianEarly Turonian outcrops of NW Patagonia, Argentina. This\nnew taxon is deeply nested within a new clade of South American\nabelisaurids, named Brachyrostra. Within brachyrostrans, the skull\nshortening and hyperossification of the skull roof appear to be\ncorrelated with a progressive enclosure of the orbit, a set of features\npossibly related to shock-absorbing capabilities. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of horn-like structures and differential cranial thickening\nappear to be convergently acquired within Abelisauridae. Based on the\nsimilarities between Skorpiovenator and carcharodontosaurid tooth\nmorphology, we suggest that isolated teeth originally referred as\npost-Cenomanian Carcharodontosauridae most probably belong to\nabelisaurids.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratosauria phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55915.phy"}]}
