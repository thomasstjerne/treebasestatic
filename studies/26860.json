Neohelicomyces longisetosus and\nHelicosporium flavidum are described as new based on molecular and\nmorphological data. Pseudohelicomyces talbotii, a new record for Taiwan,\nis renamed as Parahelicomyces talbotii because the former genus was a\nhomonym and thus illegitimate. The other six illegitimate\nPseudohelicomyces species are transferred to Parahelicomyces as new\ncombinations. Two other species, namely Acanthohelicospora guianensis\nand Neohelicosporium sympodiophorum, are also new records for Taiwan. A\ntaxonomic key to Helicosporium sensu stricto is provided. Current\ngeneric circumscription of helicospous taxa based on phylogeny is\nbriefly discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Neohelicomyces Tree","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125585","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125585.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML TRE","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr126887","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_126887.phy"}]}
