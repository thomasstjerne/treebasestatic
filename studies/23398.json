In this study, 103 P. oryzae\nand 20 P. grisea isolates were collected from seven species of plants,\nand their phylogeny, pathogenicity, and relationship with host\npreferences were analyzed to investigate the differences among them from\ndifferent hosts. Based on phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequences,\n16 isolates from crabgrass and four isolates from green bristlegrass\nwere identified as P. grisea, and another 103 isolates from crabgrass,\ngreen bristlegrass, goose grass, foxtail millet, wild millet, rice and\nsedge belonged to P. oryzae. Results on pathogenicity tests by\nartificial inoculation demonstrated that six out of ten P. oryzae\nisolates from rice and three out of 44 P. oryzae isolates from green\nbristlegrass showed cross-infectivity on green bristlegrass and rice,\nrespectively. Taken together, our results demonstrated that isolates\nfrom green bristlegrass and crabgrass consist of both P. oryzae and P.\ngrisea, and that P. oryzae isolates showed cross-infectivity between\nrice and green bristlegrass, suggesting host shifts may occur for P.\noryzae and P. grisea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117915","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117915.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_1","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117650","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117650.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_2","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117651","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117651.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_3","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117652","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117652.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_4","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117653","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117653.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_5","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117654","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117654.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_6","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117655","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117655.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_7","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117656","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117656.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_8","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117657.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_9","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117658.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_10","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117659.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_11","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117660.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_12","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117661","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117661.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_13","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117662.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_14","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117663.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_15","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117664.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_16","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117665.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_17","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117666.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_18","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117667","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117667.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_19","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117668.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_20","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117669","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117669.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_21","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117670","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117670.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_22","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117671","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117671.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_23","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117672","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117672.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_24","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117673","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117673.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_25","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117674","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117674.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_26","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117675","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117675.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_27","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117676","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117676.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_28","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117677","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117677.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_29","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117678","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117678.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP_100","ntax":"143","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117
