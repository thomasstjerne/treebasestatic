The two species were found from Tibet of southwest China, and\ngrow on rotten gymnosperm woods or charred gymnosperm roots. S. xxx is\ncharacterized by annual, resupinate basidioma with a cream to salmon and\noccasionally shiny pore surface, angular pores (79 per mm), a dimitic\nhyphal system, and lunate basidiospores measuring 33.5 × 0.91.1 μm. S.\nyyy is characterized by annual, resupinate basidioma with a white to\ncream fresh pore surface which become cream to honey-yellow and shiny\nupon drying, round pores (78 per mm), a dimitic hyphal system, and\nlunate basidiospores measuring 2.93.1 × 11.1 μm. The phylogenetic\nanalysis based on the combined 2-locus dataset [5.8S + nuc 28S rDNA\n(nLSU)] shows that the two species belong to Sidera and they are\nmorphologically compared with related species, respectively. An\nidentification key to 16 accepted species of Sidera in worldwide is\nprovided in the paper.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr135870","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_135870.phy"}]}
