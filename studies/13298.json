The Asian\nbasal neoceratopsians share some very important traits not found in any\nNorth American group until now, including a fenestrated frill and\npremaxillary teeth. Likewise, the North American basal taxa have some\ntraits not found in the Asian forms, the most important of which is a\nvery specialized tooth wear pattern. Cerasinops hodgskissi, a new basal\nneoceratopsian from the Lower Two Medicine River Formation of Montana,\nexhibits all of the above characters along with others previously found\non only one of the two continents. The new species is a sister group to\nLeptoceratopsidae in a cladistic analysis, and is a link between the\ntaxa on the two continents. Cerasinops also exhibits extremely\ninteresting anatomical and histological features that indicate the\npossibility of bipedality in this taxon, a locomotor pattern not found\npreviously in basal neoceratopsians (it has been suggested in some, but\nwith little evidence).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 6","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Ceratopsidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_56321.phy"}]}
