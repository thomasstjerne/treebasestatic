Morphology . Molecular phylogeny","DOI":"","Abstract":" Two new Conidiobolus species, were isolated from Anhui and\nShandong provinces, China. A polyphasic taxonomic approach comprising\nmorphylogical characters and molecular data (the nuclear large subunit\nribosomal DNA and the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene\nsequences) was applied to determine their novel taxonomic status in the\ngenus Conidiobolus. C. yantianshanensis is phylogenetically related to\nC. khandalensis (ATCC15162), and it can be differed from C. khandalensis\nby its larger primary conidia. C. drechslerii is closed to C. gonimodes\n(ATCC14445) in the phylogenetic tree, and C. drechslerii is\nmorphologically different from C. gonimodes by its larger primary\nconidia and two types of microconidia. Both species are genetically\ndistinct from morphylogically related species revealed by phylogenetic\nanalyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PHYLIP 1+","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr107606","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_107606.phy"}]}
