Although this\ngroup has been frequently considered as deeply nested within\nDeinonychosauria and Dromaeosauridae, most of the features supporting\nthis interpretation are conflictive, at least. Modification of\nintegrative databases, such as that recently published by Hu et\nal. (2009), produces significant changes in the topological distribution\nof taxa within Deinonychosauria, depicting unenlagiids outside this\nclade. Our analysis retrieves, in contrast, a monophyletic Avialae\nformed by Unenlagiidae plus Aves.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Figure 1B","ntax":"88","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Unenlagiidae phylogeny","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55260.phy"}]}
