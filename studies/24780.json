The ascomycete C. paspali is\nknown as the pathogen responsible for this disease in both grasses. This\nfungus produces alkaloids including ergot alkaloids and indole\nditerpenes which have potent neurotropic activities in mammals. A total\nof 32 isolates from Uruguay were obtained from infected P. dilatatum and\nP. plicatulum. Isolates were phylogenetically identified using partial\nsequences of the genes for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase\nII (RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), β-tubulin (TUB2)\nand the nuc rDNA 28S subunit (28S). Isolates were also genotyped by RAPD\nand presence of genes within the ergot alkaloid (EA) and\nindole-diterpene (IDT) biosynthetic clusters. This study represents the\nfirst genetic characterization of several isolates of C. paspali. The\nresults from this study provide insight into the genotypic diversity of\nClaviceps paspali present in P. dilatatum and suggest that isolates from\nP. plicatulum could be considered an ecological subspecies or\nspecialized variant of C. paspali. Some of these isolates show\nhypothetical alkaloid genotypes never reported before.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118983","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118983.phy"},{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr118984","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_118984.phy"}]}
