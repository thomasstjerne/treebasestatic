Our initial phylogenetic analysis of these fungi based\nsolely on the analysis of the D2 variable region of the nuc large\nsubunit 28S rDNA placed them within the Phialocephala genus. As more\ntaxonomic data became available for cryptic members within this genus,\nit became evident that further phylogenetic analysis was necessary to\nprovide a more accurate species-level placement of these organisms. In\norder to achieve this, five phylogenetic programs were utilized to\nanalyze the DNA loci of each fungus in three ways: singly, concatenated,\nand through the generation of a species tree. Based on these analyses,\nwe have concluded that P. peltatum endophyte 5 (PPE5) is a new strain of\nP. fortinii and a member of the P. fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata\ncomplex (PAC). Additionally, we report P. peltatum endophyte 7 (PPE7) as\na new species of Phialocephala that we have named P. podophylli.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 COX-1 tree","ntax":"56","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 COX-1 tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77142.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 pPF-076 tree","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 pPF-076 alignment","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77143.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 pPF-018 tree","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 pPF-018 tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77172.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 concatenated tree","ntax":"123","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 concatenated alignment","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77182.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 EF1-alpha tree","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 EF1-alpha tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77141.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 beta-tubulin tree","ntax":"122","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 beta-tubulin tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77140.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 pPF-061 Tree","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 pPF-061 Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77122.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 28S tree","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 28S tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77147.phy"},{"tree_label":"PPE5&7 ITS tree","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"PPE5&7 ITS tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_77146.phy"}]}
