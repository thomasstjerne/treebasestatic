Aiming to expand the\nknowledge of fungi causing leaf spot diseases on ryegrass ( Lolium\nmultiflorum ) from southern Brazil, a comprehensive survey was\nperformed, which resulted in seven species of plant pathogenic fungi.\nAll species have been identified using a polyphasic approach, combining\nmorphological, ecological and molecular sequence data from, when\nnecessary, up to seven different genomic loci (actin, calmodulin,\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, histone, ITS, LSU and partial\ntranslation elongation factor 1-α). Representative strains of each genus\nwere subjected to pathogenicity tests. Among all species studied, two\nrepresents new-host association ( Exserohilum rostratum and\nColletotrichum plurivorum ), three are new reports to Brazil ( Bipolaris\nsorokiniana , Pyricularia oryzae , and Pyrenophora nobleae ), and two\nare new to science, namely Curvularia lolii sp. nov., and Cercospora\nlolii sp. nov ., which were described and illustrated. The results\npresented here forms the basis for identifying at the field, which in\nthe future, could help breeders to design strategies for the control and\nintegrated management in crop-livestock production systems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_129973.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyrenophora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127176.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Colletotrichum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127173.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Pyricularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127177.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"63","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Curvularia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127174.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"57","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Bipolaris","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127171.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Exserohilum","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_127175.phy"}]}
