Here\nwe provide further genetic insights into Potamogeton hybrids from China,\nwhere ten or more hybrids were likely to be exist, yet only six were\ngenetically confirmed so far. The observed incongruences between plastid\n(chloroplast) trnTâ“trnF and nuclear ITS phylogenies indicates that\nthree cases of hybridization were involved yet left undiscussed or\ninappropriately discussed in the previous phylogenetic studies. Of\nthese, one was identified as P. x inbaensis from Japan; another was\ninferred as a presumable triploid hybrid between tetraploid maternal P.\ndistinctus and diploid paternal P. octandrus; the other was verified as\na hybrid between presumable within P. perfoliatus cryptic lineage and P.\nwrightii with lack of inference of parental combinations. The latter two\ncombinations are new to the science","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
