In addition to this\nspecies diversity, these wrens vary in a number of behavioral\ncharacteristics, in particular in the presence and structure of vocal\nduets, which makes them an interesting target for comparative\nevolutionary ecological and behavioral study. However, no phylogenetic\nhypothesis for this groupwhich would provide a sound basis for\ncomparative analysisis currently available. While previous molecular\nphylogenetic work established conclusively that the type of this genus,\nThryothorus ludovicianus (Latham), was not part of a monophyletic group\nwith other Thryothorus, the exact limits of the genus could not be\nestablished due to limited taxon sampling. Here, we present molecular\ndata from all but four currently recognized species of Thryothorus.\nThese data conWrm that Thryothorus is paraphyletic, and that the type T.\nludovicianus does not form a monophyletic group with any other member of\nthe genus. Based on analyses of our data, we resurrect two previously\nrecognized wren genera, Pheugopedius and Thryophilus, and erect a new\ngenusCantorchilusto house the remaining ex- Thryothorus species. Our\nhypothesis of relationships will provide a Wrm basis for future\nbehavioral and morphological analyses of these species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"54","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Thryothorus wrens and allies","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48696.phy"}]}
