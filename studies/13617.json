Evidence advocates\nfor their inclusion into global phylogenomic studies and their\nconsideration as a distinct and ancient form of life.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"200","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58454","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58454.phy"}]}
