Adult\ncharacters have not definitively resolved the position of\nGlypholomatinae within the Omaliine Group, but suggest that it may be\nrelatively basal. Larvae and pupae recently collected with adults of\nGlypholoma pustuliferum Jeannel are attributable to that species on the\nbasis of that association, a good match of size and form between pupae\nand adults, known larval synapomorphies in Staphylinidae and background\nknowledge of the Chilean fauna; these are described and illustrated.\nStructural and chaetotaxic characters of these and larvae of 25 other\nOmaliine group genera were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The\nposition of Glypholomatinae within the Omaliine Group remains uncertain,\nalthough it is weakly supported as forming a clade with Omaliinae and\nMicrosilphinae. Monophyly of the subfamily Proteininae and its\ncomponents and of the tribe Coryphiini of Omaliinae are more strongly\nsupported.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 22","ntax":"29","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Omaliine group","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3805.phy"}]}
