Bivalve nuclear genome is\npoorly understood; conversely, bivalve mitochondrial genomes exhibit a\nstunning variability in terms of gene order, non-coding regions, and\nnucleotide sequences. As a consequence, molecular evolutionary studies\nfocused more on subclades, typically at the superfamilial level, or even\nbelow. Approaches to the higher level phylogenetic reconstructions were\nrare, also because of the lack of a universally accepted methodological\npipeline to analyze molecular data. Here we present a class-level\nbivalve phylogeny with a broad sample of 122 ingroup taxa, using four\nmitochondrial markers (12s, 16s, cox1, cytb). Rigorous techniques have\nbeen exploited to set up the dataset, analyze the phylogenetic signal,\nand infer a single final tree. In this study, we show the basal\ncondition of Opponobranchia to all Autobranchia, as well as of\nPalaeoheterodonta to the remaining Autobranchia, which we here propose\nto call Amarsipobranchia. Anomalodesmata were retrieved as monophyletic\nand basal to (Heterodonta + Pteriomorphia). Bivalves morphological\ncharacters were also traced onto the phylogenetic trees obtained from\nthe molecular analysis; our analysis suggests that eulamellibranch gills\nand heterodont hinge are ancestral characters for all Autobranchia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"p14","ntax":"127","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"p14","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_31309.phy"}]}
