The objective of this study was to clarify the\nphylogenetic position of P. definitus using 801 base pairs of cytochrome\n- b sequences. A matrix constituted by 43 specimens was subjected to\nmaximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian inference analyses.\nOur results indicate that P. definitus is a member of the\n“andium/amicus” group and is closely related to P. pearsoni, supporting\na set of chromosomal and morphological characters previously identified\nfor this group.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllotis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_106909.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllotis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_107089.phy"}]}
