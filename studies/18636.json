We\ndiscovered a genomic region containing the HMGA2 gene that varies\nsystematically among Darwins finch species with different beak sizes.\nTwo haplotypes that diverged early in the radiation were involved in the\ncharacter displacement event: Genotypes associated with large beak size\nwere at a strong selective disadvantage in medium ground finches\n(selection coefficient s = 0.59). Thus, a major locus has apparently\nfacilitated a rapid ecological diversification in the adaptive radiation\nof Darwins finches.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1C","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geospiza","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95818.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1D","ntax":"180","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Geospiza","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_95819.phy"}]}
