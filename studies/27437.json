Recent studies showed that Fomitopsis pinicola is a\nspecies complex and three species from North America and one species\nfrom Europe were recognized in this complex. In the current study, six\nnew species in the Fomitopsis pinicola complex are discovered from East\nAsia based on morphological characters and phylogenetic analysis\ninferred from sequences data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)\nregions, the second subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2) and the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-Î± gene (TEF). Detailed descriptions of\nthe six new species are provided. Our results also indicated that\nspecies of the F. pinicola complex from East Asia usually have limited\ndistribution areas and host specialization.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
