Both species were isolated from\nRhododendron sp. in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China. Both taxa are\ndescribed based on morphology and DNA sequence data analyzed to infer\ntheir phylogenetic relationships. A multigene phylogenetic analysis\nbased on LSU, ITS, RPB2, TEF1 and TUB2 sequence data indicate that\nDiscosia rhododendronicola is closely related to Discosia muscicola.\nDiaporthe nobilis, reported herein as a new geographical record for\nChina and its phylogeny is depicted based on ITS, TEF1 and TUB2 sequence\ndata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"81","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133775","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133775.phy"}]}
