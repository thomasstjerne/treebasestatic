MLST and phenotypic data\nstrongly supported its inclusion in the Fusarium solani species complex\n(FSSC). The new species produced a red pigment in the Sabouraud Dextrose\nAgar similar to other members of the complex. The macroconidia arising\nfrom sporodochia are falcate, dorsiventral, 34-septated (mostly\n3-septated), with pointed, tapered, and curved apical cell. The\nmicroconidia are oval and reniform, without septa. In vitro Amphotericin\nB (MIC 1 µg/ml) was the most active drug, followed by voriconazole (MIC\n8 µg/ml), which cured the infection. Our finding indicates yet another\nlineage within FSSC capable of invastive human infection.","trees":[{"tree_label":"TREE1","ntax":"231","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Fusarium solani species complex","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100539.phy"}]}
