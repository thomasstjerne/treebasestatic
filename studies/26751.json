C.\ndensopora is characterized by laterally stipitate basidiocarps with\nflabelliform to semicircular pileus, hirtellous pileal surface with\nappressed coarse hair and concentrically zones and sulcus, tiny pores, a\ndimitic hyphal system, absence of cystidia, short clavate basidia and\nthin-walled, smooth, cylindrical to allantoid basidiospores. R.\nsubglobosa is characterized by sessile or laterally stipitate\nbasidiocarps, velutinate to glabrous pileal surface with concentrically\nzones and indistinctly sulcus, tiny pores, a dimitic hyphal system,\nabsence of cystidia, guttulate, short clavate to subglobose basidia and\nthin-walled, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores. Phylogenetic\nanalyses based on a four-marker dataset were performed with maximum\nlikelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The two\nnew genera formed independent clades with strong support in\nSteccherinaceae. The discriminating characters of the two new genera and\nspecies as well as allied genera are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"67","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr125212","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_125212.phy"}]}
