Arachnoideae, a recently recognized taxon, using DNA\nsequence data (ITS, trnLtrnF, rpl32trnL(UAG)). We conclude that the\nsubsection contains 12 species, i.e. S. aphylla, S. arachnoidea, S.\nberica, S. facchinii, S. hohenwartii, S. muscoides, S. paradoxa, S.\npetraea, S. prenja, S. presolanensis, S. sedoides and S. tenella. Of\nthese, we provide the first molecular evidence for the membership of S.\nmuscoides and S. prenja in S. subsect. Arachnoideae. We provide an\nextended morphological characterization of the subsection and an\nidentification key to its species.","trees":[{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga rpl32 2019-07-18 trimmed","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120119.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"91","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga rpl32 2019-07-18 trimmed","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120120.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga trnLF rpl32-trnL","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120123.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga trnLF 2019-07-18 trimmed","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120122.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"110","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga trnLF 2019-07-18 trimmed","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120121.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"113","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga trnLF rpl32-trnL","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_120124.phy"},{"tree_label":"MrBayes","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga ITS 2020-04-05 trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122931.phy"},{"tree_label":"RAxML","ntax":"138","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Saxifraga ITS 2020-04-05 trimmed","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_122930.phy"}]}
