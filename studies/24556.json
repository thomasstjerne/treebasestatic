These isolates were characterized through a multilocus\nphylogeny based on ITS region of the ribosomal DNA, beta-tubulin (tub2)\nand translation elongation factor 1 alpha (tef1-α) sequences, in\nconjunction with morphological and physiological data. These analyses\nshowed that the isolates represented an unknown fungus for which a new\ngenus, Neptunomyces gen. nov. and a new species, Neptunomyces aureus sp.\nnov. are proposed. Phylogenetic analyses supported the affiliation of\nthis new taxon to the family Didymosphaeriaceae.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118384.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118385.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Didymosphaeriaceae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_118386.phy"}]}
