Chloroplast DNA\nsequence data were used to examine the monophyly of the two accepted\nsubgenera (Equisetum and Hippochaete) and the putative basal position of\nEquisetum giganteum. A plastid DNA region that includes rps4 was\nsequenced for all species of Equisetum. Phylogenetic analyses using\nparsimony, likelihood or posterior probability criteria, all support the\nfollowing inferences: (1) Equisetum bogotense is basal within the genus;\n(2) all other species group in two major sister clades: (i) the rest of\nsubgenus Equisetum (7 species) and (ii) subgenus Hippochaete (7\nspecies). On the basis of the present phylogeny, bisexuality would not\nbe the ancestral state in the Equisetum genus, but characters shared\namong species of the subgenus Equisetum, such as superficial stomata and\nprotruding antheridia, could be ancestral in the genus.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Horsetails","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5822.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Horsetails","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5823.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"20","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Horsetails","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5824.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Horsetails","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5825.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig x","ntax":"15","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogeny of Horsetails","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5826.phy"}]}
