Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS region of rDNA\nconfirm that species within Hypochnicium form a monophyletic group. The\nsynonymy of Gyrophanopsis with Hypochnicium is therefore validated and\nthe genus Nodotia is re-evaluated as a synonym of Hypochnicium. Sequence\nanalyses of H. zealandicum and a specimen within the Hypochnicium\npunctulatum complex from New Zealand place both on well-supported clades\nas sister taxa of H. polonense and H. cremicolor respectively. Although\nspore dimensions overlap with those of H. polonense, H. zealandicum is\ncurrently retained as a separate species on the basis of geographical\nseparation and phylogenetic analysis. New Zealand specimens recorded as\nH. punctulatum represent a new species, which is described and\nillustrated as H. aotearoae here.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Jackknife Tree","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Hypochnicium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_658.phy"}]}
