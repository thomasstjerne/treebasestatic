The inferred phylogeny lends support to merging these two\nsubfamilies established by Engler based on different fruit types.\nMoreover, Phellodendron, Tetradium, Toddalia and Zanthoxylum were\nresolved as a clade, supporting the proposal for a \u001aproto-Rutaceae\u001a group.\nThe molecular data also showed that members of Euodia sensu lato should\nbe placed in three different genera: Tetradium, Euodia, and Melicope.\nThe latter two genera are more closely related to Acronychia than they\nare to Euodia sensu stricto. Discrepancies were found in the positions\nof Melicope vitiflora and Tetradium daniellii, suggesting further\nstudies are necessary.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ITS 1 Strict","ntax":"74","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rutaceae subfamilies Rutoideae and Toddalioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2704.phy"},{"tree_label":"ITS 2 Strict","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rutaceae subfamilies Rutoideae and Toddalioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2705.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL intron Strict","ntax":"89","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rutaceae subfamilies Rutoideae and Toddalioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2706.phy"},{"tree_label":"trnL-F spacer Strict","ntax":"53","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Rutaceae subfamilies Rutoideae and Toddalioideae","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2707.phy"}]}
