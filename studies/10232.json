Here, we show that these larvae live unencysted in the\nintestinal lumen of the clam. Morphologically, the larvae are similar to\n(although significantly larger than) tapeworm larvae previously\ndescribed living in the gut of amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) from\nthe same habitat. Sequence data from the D2 region of the 28S rDNA from\nclam-infecting larvae were identical to the sequence of A. brevissime\nisolated as larvae from amphioxus and as adults from a stingray\n(Dasyatis say). The sequence data leave little doubt that the dwarf\nrazor clam and amphioxus are alternative intermediate hosts in the life\ncycle of Acanthobothrium brevissime.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 MP","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthobothrium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6855.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ML","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Acanthobothrium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6708.phy"}]}
