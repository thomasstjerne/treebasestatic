Ophelina fauveli (Caullery, 1944) is\nreported for the first time in Australian waters and its description has\nbeen updated; the two other species are new to science and are formally\ndescribed. The main diagnostic characters for the species are based on\ndifferences in the pygidial funnel. Ophelina tesellata sp. nov. is\ndistinguished by having a club-shaped funnel with a distinctive\ntessellated pattern on the ventral edge. Ophelina cyprophila sp. nov.\nhas a more elongated pygidial funnel and fewer rim cirri. Recognition of\nthese two morphologically similar species was supported by sequences of\nthe cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and histone H3 genes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"UPGMA tree
