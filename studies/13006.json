Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region\n(ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha\n(TEF) gene of 41 Phyllosticta-like isolates from Citrus were compared to\nthose sequences from the type specimens of Phyllosticta recorded from\naround the world. Phylogenetic analysis resolved all the sequences of\nAustralian accessions into two major clades. One clade corresponded to\nP. citricarpa, which causes citrus black spot disease. The other clade\ncontained P. capitalensis, which is a known endophyte of Citrus and many\nother plant species. No Australian isolates were identified as the newly\ndescribed pathogens of citrus P. citriasiana or P. citrichinaensis, or\nthe endophytes G. mangiferae, P. brazilianiae, or P.\ncitribraziliensis.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"52","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phyllosticta Maximum likelihood tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_55226.phy"}]}
