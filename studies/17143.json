Although lecithotrophs appeared to speciate\nmore often and accumulate over time in some groups, lecithotrophy also\nincreased extinction rates, and tests for state-dependent\ndiversification were never performed. Molecular phylogenies of diverse\ngroups instead suggested lecithotrophs accumulate without diversifying\ndue to frequent, unidirectional character change. Although lecithotrophy\nhas repeatedly originated in most phyla, no adult trait has been\ncorrelated with shifts in larval type. Thus, both the evolutionary\norigins of lecithotrophy and its consequences for patterns of species\nrichness remain poorly understood.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"210","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Sacoglossa","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_89594.phy"}]}
