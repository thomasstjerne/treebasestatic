Results derived from Bayesian and parsimony\nanalyses provide evidence for the long-suspected paraphyly of the genus\nLobelia, comprising over 400 species as presently circumscribed. The\nperennial dwarf herbs belonging to the Andean genus Lysipomia are sister\nto a group comprising the Neotropical shrubs Burmeistera, Centropogon,\nand Siphocampylus. Giant lobelioids from the Hawaiian Islands, Brazil,\nAfrica, and Sri Lanka form a strongly supported group. Character\noptimizations on the phylogenetic tree reveal that shifts in fruit types\nand lignification have occurred much more commonly than generally\nassumed. The main clades in the subfamily are outlined, which largely\ncontradict previous classifications based on morphology.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian con 50 majrule","ntax":"76","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Campanulaceae subfam.
