A well-supported clade comprising members\nof the traditional orders Mermithida and Mononchida (including\nBathyodontina) forms the sister taxon to the Dorylaimida. Inferred\nrelationships within this clade indicate that Mermithida shares more\nrecent common ancestry with Mononchina than does Bathyodontina.\nVertebrate parasites within Dorylaimia (Dioctophymida and Trichinellida)\nare reconstructed in a sister-taxon relationship with the\nMononchida/Dorylaimida lineage. The enigmatic order Isolaimida\n(represented by Isolaimium) appears to be ancestral to all other\nDorylaimia sampled. Expanded taxon sampling for phylogenetic analyses of\nthe subclass raises new possibilities for the reconstruction of\nhypothetical character states in the common ancestor of Dorylaimia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nygolaimina and Dorylaimina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1919.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Nygolaimina and Dorylaimina","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_1920.phy"}]}
