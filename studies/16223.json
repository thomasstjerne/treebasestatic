Phylogenetic\nanalyses based on internal transcriber spacer (ITS) sequence data\nsupport the new species as sister to E. pubescens, a widespread species\nin central Brazil. Both species have stellate trichomes on the leaflets,\na character not found in other species of Eriotheca. Eriotheca\nestevesiae differs from E. pubescens by having oblong to\nnarrowly-elliptic (vs. mostly obovate) leaflets that are chartaceous\n(vs. coriaceous) and covered with ferruginous (vs. golden) trichomes;\npedicels and calyces that lack stellate trichomes; and smaller flowers\nand capsules. Analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs\nof the leaf epidermis revealed that E. estevesiae also differs from E.\npubescens by the presence of peltate scales with an irregularly\ndeep-lobed (vs. regular) outline and by stomatal density and mean\nstomatal length. Notes on distribution, phenology, and conservation\nstatus of the new species as well as a discussion of its morphological\nrelationship to other species of Eriotheca from Cerrado are\nprovided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76875","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76875.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76874","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76874.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 3","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76879","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76879.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 2","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76878","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76878.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76877","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76877.phy"},{"tree_label":"Strict","ntax":"12","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr76876","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_76876.phy"}]}
