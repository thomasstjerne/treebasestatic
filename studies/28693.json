Many\nspecies in this family are drought resistant and important for studying\nfungal adaptation and evolution. Stictidaceae comprises 33 genera, but\nmany of them have been neglected for decades due to lack of field\ncollections and molecular data. In this study, we introduce the new\nspecies Fitzroyomyce hyaloseptisporus and synonymize Stictis pandanicola\nunder Fitzroyomyces. We also provide additional morphological and\nmolecular data for Ostropomyces pruinosella and O. thailandica based on\nnew collections isolated from an unidentified woody dicotyledonous host.\nTaxonomic conclusions are made with the aid of morphological evidence\nand phylogenetic analysis of combined LSU, ITS and mtSSU sequence data.\nCharacteristics such as the shape and septation of ascospores and\nconidia as well as lifestyles among genera of Stictidaceae are\ndiscussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133004","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133004.phy"}]}
