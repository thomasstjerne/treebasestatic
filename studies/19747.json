Based on morphological characters and\nphylogeny of DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS15.8SITS2) region (ITS) and part of the translation elongation\nfactor 1alpha gene (EF1alpha), Dothiorella omnivora Linaldeddu, Deidda\n& Scanu, previously isolated from walnut (Juglans regia L.) in\nFrance and Iran, hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) and Hop hornbeam (Ostrya\ncarpinifolia Scop.) in Italy, European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and Lawson cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A.\nMurray) Parl.) and White cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) in Serbia, is\nreported for the first time in Australia, and for the first time from\ngrapevines (Vitis vinifera L.). Four species of Dothiorella, and a total\nof 15 species of Botryosphaeriaceous fungi are now recognised from\ngrapevines in Australia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"ML tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum likelihood tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Alternative Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98131.phy"},{"tree_label":"MP tree","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Maximum parsimony tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_98130.phy"}]}
