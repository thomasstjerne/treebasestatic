{"Authors":" Lillis Urban, C Donovan Bailey","Year":" 2012","Title":" Phylogeny of Leavenworthia and Selenia (Brassicaceae)","Journal":" Systematic Botany","Volume":"","Issue":"","Pages":"","Keywords":" Evolution, Leavenworthia, phylogeny, self-incompatibility,\nSelenia, simultaneous analysis","DOI":"","Abstract":" The present study aimed to develop a robust, extensively\nsampled phylogenetic hypothesis across all species in Leavenworthia and\nSelenia using chloroplast (psbJ to petA) and nuclear encoded (nrDNA ITS\nand LUMINIDEPENDENS) DNA sequence data. Parsimony and maximum likelihood\nmethodologies were employed. Strong ML bootstrap and parsimony jackknife\nsupport were recovered for the monophyly of the sister pair\nLeavenworthia plus Selenia and for the respective monophyly of each\ngenus. Leavenworthia and Selenia are hypothesizes to have originated in\nthe Ozark Mountains and results from an analysis of branch lengths\nleading to Leavenworthia and Selenia are consistent with Leavenworthia\nhaving diversified more recently than Selenia. Comparative results from\nphylogenetic analyses indicate that L. aurea and L. texana are hybrids\nwith a shared set of putative parents. Polyploidy and extensive\naneuploidy complicate the interpretation of chromosomal evolution within\nand between these genera. Lastly, patterns of diversification within\nLeavenworthia have included a minimum of three transitions from\nself-compatible to self-incompatible population systems.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58762.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"78","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Luminidependens MP","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58783.phy"},{"tree_label":"Sup Fig. 1","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58951.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58978.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58973.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"100","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58979.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58980.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58972.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"95","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_58981.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"111","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Leavenworthia and Selenia","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_59031.phy"}]}
