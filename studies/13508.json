{"Authors":" Hirotoshi Sato, Noriaki Murakami","Year":" 2008","Title":" Reproductive isolation among cryptic species in the\nectomycorrhizal genus Strobilomyces: Population-level CAPS marker-based\ngenetic analysis","Journal":" Molecular phylogenetics and Evolution","Volume":" 48","Issue":"","Pages":" 326-334","Keywords":" Cryptic species; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; CAPS marker;\nReproductive isolation; Strobilomyces","DOI":"","Abstract":" Among the higher fungi, reproductively isolated cryptic\nspecies exist that are morphologically difficult to distinguish owing to\na lack of taxonomically useful morphological characters. Mating tests\nare helpful for detecting reproductive isolation between cryptic\nspecies, but are often difficult to perform for higher fungi, especially\nectomycorrhizal fungi. In order to identify cryptic species of the\nectomycorrhizal genus Strobilomyces more efficiently, lineages were\ndefined based on the nucleotide sequence of two mitochondrial genes.\nThen the gene flow among lineages was measured using cleaved amplified\npolymorphic sequences (CAPS) markers designed for single copy nuclear\ngenes. No heterozygosity was observed between different lineages, but\nwithin the same lineage heterozygosity was present at the ratio expected\ngiven Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. These results show that the mtDNA\nlineages are separate Mendelian populations, possibly cryptic species\nthat are reproductively isolated from each other.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP
