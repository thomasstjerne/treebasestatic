To clarify this situation, samples taken from the\nproduction area have been tested in Concepción and nearby areas. After\nthat, pathogenic tests have been implemented and have been identified\nthrough positive pathogenic analysis. Making a cross-checking of the ITS\nrDNA sequence of monosporic strain with molecular databases, it was\nobserved a percentage of 100% similarity with sequences of Alternaria\nalternata, confirming the results of the morphological studies. In\naddition, a distance tree genetic analysis confirmed the taxonomic\nidentity of the Alternaria strain from C. morifolium samples as A.\nalternata.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Alternaria alternata","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_107699.phy"}]}
