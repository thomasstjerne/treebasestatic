Conidia for\n15 of 23 isolates were observed and measured. DNA from all isolates was\namplified to obtain sequences of the ITS locus and a portion of the\ntranslation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1-alpha), which were then\nqueried for similarity to other Botryosphaeriaceae species using BLASTn\nand used to build phylogenetic trees. Three genera were identified:\nLasiodiplodia, Neodeightonia and Neofusicoccum. Six new plant\nhost-fungal genera associations were ascertained. A new Neodeightonia\nspecies has likely been isolated, but further research is needed before\na species name can be assigned. This study illustrates that systematic\nstudies are needed to examine Botryosphaeriaceae species associations\nwith palms (Arecaceae) and determine their pathogenicity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodeightonia TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117183.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neofusicoccum ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Neodeightonia ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117185.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lasiodiplodia ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_117182.phy"}]}
