Mariannaea chlamydospora is characterized by its\ncream-colored, zonate colonies on PDA, smooth conidiophores, fusiform\nconidia, and abundant chlamydospores. Mariannaea cinerea forms grey\ncolonies and ellipsoidal to subglobose conidia. Mariannaea fusiformis\nforms purple colonies and fusiform to subglobose conidia. Mariannaea\nlignicola has brown conidiophores and broad hyphae. The molecular\nphylogeny was inferred using ITS, LSU and TUB-2 loci. The type species\nof Mariannaea (M. elegans) is epitypified. The variety M. elegans var.\npunicea is raised to species rank. Mariannaea clavispora is excluded\nfrom Mariannaea because of its cylindrical phialides, straight conidial\nchains and deviating phylogenetic affinity. Mariannaea nipponica did not\nfit well with the generic concept of Mariannaea based on their\nmorphological characters, and its generic placement remains uncertain. A\nkey to the currently accepted 15 species of Mariannaea is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Raxml_ITSLSU","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99992","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99992.phy"},{"tree_label":"Raxml_ITSTUB","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr99993","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_99993.phy"}]}
