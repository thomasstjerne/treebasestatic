This taxon falls within the family Omphalotaceae as a sister\ngroup to Gymnopus in phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear ribosomal\nDNA from the internal transcribed spacer region and 5 end of the large\nsubunit. Morphologically, it is characterized by convex to flabellate\nfruiting bodies with distinctly gelatinized trama, pileipellis in the\nform of a cutis with erect fascicles of tubular, spirally-incrusted\nhyphae, and nonamyloid, broadly ellipsoid basidiospores. This\ncombination of features, in particular the lack of a rameales structure,\nserve to distinguish Gymnopanella from Gymnopus, Marasmiellus, and other\nsimilar genera of the Omphalotaceae or Marasmiaceae. The new taxon is\nknown only from Chilean Nothofagus forests of approximately 45-46 °\nSouth latitude, but concerted searching in similar habitats in\nsurrounding areas or in New Zealand may extend the known range\nconsiderably.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopoids 114 taxa ITS-LSU MrBayes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100016.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"114","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gymnopoids 114 taxa ITS-LSU NJT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_100017.phy"}]}
