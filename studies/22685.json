The\ntype species is Articulospora tetracladia, which is distributed\nworldwide. Its most frequent populations in nature have dimorphic\nconidia, differing by the extent of conidial branching (i.e., one or two\nlevels of branching). Some strains, stable in culture, produce\nexclusively conidia of one type. With the molecular analyses employed\nhere and the relatively low number of available isolates (20),\nseparation based on branching of conidia has not been fully supported.\nTherefore we propose to retain the broad concept of A. tetracladia with\ndimorphic conidia. Among the three gene sequences tested as potential\nbarcodes, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene was the most\npromising region. All strains yielded amplifiable DNA which provided\nadequate resolution, according to accepted ranges in inter/intraspecific\ndifferences, to differentiate among the three Articulospora and two\nFontanospora species that were tested (Articulospora atra, Articulospora\nproliferata, A. tetracladia, Fontanospora eccentrica, Fontanospora\nfusiramosa). D1/D2 primers also permitted amplification in all strains,\nhowever without much resolution. Amplification of the COX1 gene sequence\nwas least consistent.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 6","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111688.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111684.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 4","ntax":"82","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111686.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 5","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111687.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 7","ntax":"27","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Articulospora","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111689.phy"}]}
