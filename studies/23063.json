For example, pathway\nstructure and regulation could make some phenotypes inaccessible or\nrestrict the routes through which phenotypes evolve. In this study, we\nexamine floral anthocyanin pigments across the Solanaceae family and\ntest whether patterns of phenotypic variation are consistent with\npredicted constraints based on the structure of the flavonoid\nbiosynthetic pathway. We find that anthocyanin evolution occurs in a\nstepwise manner whereby transitions between the production of red\nmono-hydroxylated pelargonidin pigments and blue tri-hydroxylated\ndelphinidin pigments first passes through an intermediate step of\nproducing purple di-hydroxylated cyanidin pigments. Although the\ntransitions between these three pigment types differ in frequency, we\ninfer that these shifts are often reversible, suggesting that regulatory\nmutations are commonly involved in pigment transitions. Furthermore, our\nstudy finds that some pigment combinations are never observed, pointing\nto additional constraints on naturally occurring phenotypes. Overall,\nour findings provide insights into how the structure of an\nangiosperm-wide biochemical pathway has shaped macroevolutionary\nvariation in floral pigmentation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"84","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Solanaceae ITS waxy matK ndhF trnLF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_113072.phy"}]}
