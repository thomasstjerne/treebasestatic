Previous molecular\nphylogenetic analyses have suggested this yeast is an asexual stage of\nthe smut fungus Macalpinomyces spermophorus (synonym Ustilago\nspermophora, Ustilaginales). To reveal the teleomorphanamorph\nconnection, yeast-like isolates from germinated teliospores of\nmorphologically identified M. spermophorus on Eragrostis ferruginea from\nJapan were analyzed. The internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA of\nthe yeast isolates was mostly identical with that of known isolates of\nP. tsukubaensis. Physiological analysis showed that the characteristics\nof the yeast isolates correlated well with P. tsukubaensis. These data\nrevealed that P. tsukubaensis is the anamorph of M. spermophorus and\nshould be treated as a synonym of M. spermophorus. In addition, the\nerythritol-producing ability of the yeast isolates derived from\nteliospores of M. spermophorus were confirmed by high-performance\nion-exchange chromatography and 13C NMR analyses.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Macalpinomyces MLT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_111632.phy"}]}
