We introduce the new tribe\nAmphidurini and the new genus Neogyptis to accomodate these new\nfindings. Amphidurini is sister to Gyptini and Ophiodromini and includes\nAmphiduros Hartman, 1959, Amphiduropsis, Pleijel, 2001, Neogyptis, new\ngenus, and, possibly, Parahesione Pettibone, 1956. Morphologically,\nAmphidurini can be separated from Gyptini by the distally, rather than\nsubdistally, inserted ventral cirri, and Neogyptis by the combination of\nthis feature, the presence of a median antenna, and a distal ring with\npapillae on the proboscis. We redescribe and transfer the four species\nG. crypta Pleijel, 1993, G. mediterranea Pleijel, 1993, G. plurisetis\nHilbig, 1992, and G. rosea (Malm, 1874) from Gyptis to Neogyptis, new\ngenus, and describe five new species from shallow waters in Belize, Hong\nKong, off Vladivostok, and deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Lau Basin\noff Fiji.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr48016","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_48016.phy"}]}
