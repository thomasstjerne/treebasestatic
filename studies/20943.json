Richness and diversity of polypore fungi were calculated\nfrom Shannon-Weaver (H) and Simpson (D) diversity index on logs at three\nsites (CEB, SBL and SEEF forest concessions). In order to identify\npolypore fungi community and compare fungi diversity between tree\nspecies and sampled sites, carpophores were harvested during two years\non logs laid down along forest roads. Genomic DNA were extracted from\ncarpophores, the ITS rDNA region (ITS1 - 5.8S - ITS2) was amplified and\nsequencing performed. Sixty-four (64) polypore fungi were identified\namong Basidiomycetes fungi harvested, those clustered into 28\nOperational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and scattered within 13 families\n(Corticiaceae, Fomitopsidaceae, Ganodermataceae, Hericiaceae,\nHydnodontaceae, Hymenochaetaceae, Meruliaceae, Phanerochaetaceae,\nPolyporaceae, Punctulariaceae, Schizoporaceae, Stereaceae and a family\nclassified Incertae Sedis) belonging to Polyporales (64%), Russulales\n(12%), Hymenochaetales (11%), Corticiales (11%) and Trechisporales (2%)\norders. Diversity indexes were higher in Beli followed by Sorro and\nAlep. This diversity was also high in sites (H= 3.15 and D=0.04). Fungal\ndiversity was higher in SEEF site, followed respectively by SBL and CEB\nsites. Few fungi were shared by two tree species or two harvested sites.\nThis research is a first study on polypore fungi diversity associated\nwith Alep, Beli and Sorro dead wood in southeast forests of Gabon.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree1","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr103911","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_103911.phy"}]}
