Various characters were identified\nto be of potential systematic value and were recorded for each species.\nThese characters included: texture of the osmophore surface, number of\ndistinct cell layers comprising the osmophore, nature of lipid\ninclusions in osmophore cells, and presence or absence of plastoglobuli\nin osmophore amyloplasts. These characters were combined with\ntraditional features of floral lip morphology for cladistic analysis.\nSievekingia was the postulated outgroup. Stanhopea ecornuta showed the\nlargest number of plesiomorphic characters. Stanhopea pulla, S.\nannulata, and S. candida were only slightly more derived. Stanhopea\nanfracta, S. gibbosa, S. martiana, S. oculata, S. radiosa, S. ruckeri,\nS. saccata, S. shuttleworthii, S. tigrina, S. vasquezii, and S. wardii\nform a monophyletic group that can be recognized by a labellum with an\narticulated epichile and a bicornuate mesochile (or hypochile).\nStanhopea tricornis may be a hybrid between a species of Sievekingia and\nStanhopea.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 18","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stanhopea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3236.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 17","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Stanhopea","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3235.phy"}]}
