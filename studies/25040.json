Here we estimate\ndispersal and speciation rates in Neotropical rainforest biomes to\npropose an explanation for the distribution and diversity of extant\nbutterfly species. We focus on the tribe Brassolini to infer a\ntotal-evidence species tree using the multispecies coalescent framework.\nBy applying biogeographical stochastic mapping, we infer ancestral\nranges and estimate rates of butterfly dispersal and cladogenesis at the\nscale of millions of years. We suggest that speciation in Mesoamerica\nand Chocó has only increased within the past 2 million years. In\ncontrast, speciation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest has been constant\nthroughout the past 10 million years. The disparate species\ndiversification dynamics can be explained by the geological and\nenvironmental history of each bioregion: the Central American Arc was\nlikely intermittently inundated by water for most of the Miocene (15 to\n3 million years ago), thus, reduced landmass area until the\nPlio-Pleistocene would have hindered species diversification; the\nAtlantic Forest, on the other hand, went likely through episodes of\nexpansion and contraction and has probably been periodically connected\nwith the Amazonian forest since at least the early Miocene. Importantly,\na longer time for speciation in the Atlantic Forest than in Mesoamerica\nplus Chocó is ruled out because the dispersal rates into both regions\nincreased simultaneously in the middle-Miocene. Altogether, we reveal a\nmosaic of bioregions within the Neotropics, where species rapidly\ndiversify (“cradles”: e.g., Amazonia, Mesoamerica) and gradually\naccumulate (“museums”: e.g., Amazonia, Atlantic Forest).","trees":[{"tree_label":"Concatenated consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"107","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119580","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119580.phy"},{"tree_label":"COI consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"106","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119582","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119582.phy"},{"tree_label":"CAD consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"43","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119581","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119581.phy"},{"tree_label":"EF1a consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"85","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119583","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119583.phy"},{"tree_label":"RpS5 consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119585","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119585.phy"},{"tree_label":"GAPDH consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"51","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119584","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119584.phy"},{"tree_label":"wingless consensus 50 majrule","ntax":"87","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr119586","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_119586.phy"}]}
