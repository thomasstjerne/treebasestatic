We identified an isolate of O. mirabilis from a skin scraping\nwith morphological and molecular studies. Its genome was then sequenced\nand analysed for genetic features related to classification and\nbiological characteristics.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"17","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92830","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92830.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr92829","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_92829.phy"}]}
