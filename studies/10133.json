Three East Asian taxa, Laetiporus cremeiporus sp. nov.,\nLaetiporus montanus and Laetiporus versisporus, are described and\nillustrated as well as compared with related taxa from Southeast Asia,\nNorth America and Europe. Phylogenetic analyses showed that L.\ncremeiporus and L. versisporus are clearly distinct species among\nLaetiporus taxa. The three conifer inhabiting species, Laetiporus\nconifericola, Laetiporus huroniensis and L. montanus, are closely\nrelated to each other. The European population of L. montanus exhibits\ntwo sequence variants of the EF1a: one is the same as observed in L.\nsulphureus in Europe and the other is that observed in East Asian\npopulation of L. montanus. A key to the known species of Laetiporus in\nthe northern hemisphere is provided.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"45","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laetiporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6495.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"55","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laetiporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6007.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"31","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Laetiporus","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6030.phy"}]}
