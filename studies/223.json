The many technical characters that are traditionally used\nin classification of the Inuleae are scrutinized, discussed, and\nanalysed by means of a computerized parsimony program (PAUP). With one\nrepresentative from each of the tribes Vernonieae, Liabeae, and\nLactuceae as outgroups, three different analyses have been performed.\nStrict consensus trees for the three separate analyses are presented and\ndiscussed. A consensus tree based on the cladogram topologies obtained\nfrom all the three analyses is also presented. The taxonomic implication\nof the analyses is that the tribe Inuleae is an unnatural, not\nmonophyletic group, which must be divided in better defined monophyletic\ntribes. Hence, three tribes are recognized and the majority of the\ndescribed genera of the Inuleae are tentatively referred to one of these\ntribes . The tribes Gnaphalieae Rydb. (comprising the\nInuleae\u001aGnaphaliinae and the Inuleae - Athrixiinae sensu Merxmuller et\nal.) and the Inuleae s.str., are accepted. Furthermore, the former\nsubtribe Inuleae\u001aPlucheinae Benth. is recognized and described as the new\ntribe Plucheae (Benth.) A.
