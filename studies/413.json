Our results supported the taxonomical treatment in\nsubgenus level of Bas (1969) and Singer (1986) who divided the genus\nAmanita into two subgenera Amanita and Lepidella based on the amyloidity\nof spores. However, in section level, we suggested that subgenus Amanita\nshould be divided into three sections (Amanita, Vaginatae and\nCaesareae). Moreover, our results showed the necessity to rearrange the\ndisordered assemblage of members in the subgenus Lepidella. As for three\nsubspecies of A. hemibapha and three varieties of A. vaginata, it is\nnecessary to grade up their taxonomical ranks from subspecies / variety\nto species. It appeares that A. pantherina and A. muscaria are extremely\nrelated phylogenetically. The molecular biological technique was proven\nto be sensitive for detecting taxa that are difficult to detect by\nmorphological characters.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Amanita","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3418.phy"}]}
