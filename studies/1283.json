We report here the first molecular\nevidence that the North American anamorphs belong, indeed, to O.\nneolycopersici. The ITS sequences of the North American anamorphs\ndetermined in this study were identical with those determined for three\nJapanese and two European specimens of O. neolycopersici and differed\nfrom the ITS sequences of two other European specimens in only one base\nin the ITS2 region. A morphological study confirmed that all the North\nAmerican Oidium anamorphs included in this study produced conidia singly\nsimilar to O. neolycopersici. They were readily distinguished from O.\nlycopersici which produces conidia in chains and it is known to infect\ntomato only in Australia. The phylogenetic analysis showed that O.\nneolycopersici is a distinct powdery mildew species, and it is neither\nidentical nor closely related to an anamorph of a known polyphagous\nspecies of the Erysiphaceae. Apparently, it was introduced to the USA\nand Canada only in the 1990s, but its origin is still unknown.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"59","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oidium neolycopersici","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2028.phy"}]}
