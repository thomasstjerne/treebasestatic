The multigene phylogenetic analysis shows that\nthe new taxon forms a distinct clade and is closely related to D.\nsackstonii and D. caryae. Detailed description, color photo plates, and\nphylogenetic analyses are provided to show the placement of the new\nspecies, as well as the comparison with the closely related taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr133729","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_133729.phy"}]}
