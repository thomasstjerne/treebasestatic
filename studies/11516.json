{"Authors":" Anna Petri, Bengt Oxelman","Year":" 2011","Title":" Phylogenetic relationships within Silene (Caryophyllaceae)\nsection Physolychnis","Journal":" Taxon","Volume":" 60","Issue":" 4","Pages":" 953-968","Keywords":" allopolyploidy, Far East, Central Asia, hybrid origin,\nmolecular phylogeny, Silene","DOI":"","Abstract":" Phylogenetic relationships within Silene L., section\nPhysolychnis (Benth.) Bocquet, are investigated using DNA sequences from\ntwo low copy nuclear regions and three plastid regions. We expand the\ncircumscription of Physolychnis to include also Siberian and Eurasian\ntaxa, with S. zawadskii and S. uralensis as delimiters of the section.\nTwo main clades are identified within Physolychnis, the Siberian S.\najanensis group and an Asian/American clade. Several taxa, previously\nclassified to section Odontopetalae Schischk. ex Chowdhuri, section\nOccidentales Chowdhuri and section Morrisonmontanae C.L. Tang, are shown\nto belong to the Asian/American clade, which otherwise corresponds to\nBocquetÂ’s (1969) circumscription of section Physolychnis. Sect.\nPhysolychnis also includes several additional, mainly Asian taxa (e.g.,\nS. davidii, S. seoulensis, S. keiskei, S. viscosa, S. quadriloba, and\nhomoeologues from S. songarica, S. firma, and S. tolmatchevii). Several\nputative allopolyploids are identified, in several cases stemming from\ncrosses between the two main clades. The two allotetraploids S.\ninvolucrata and S. sachalinensis, although morphologically and\ngeographically distinct, have indistinguishable ancestries.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"131","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relationships within Silene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47707.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"133","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relationships within Silene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47708.phy"},{"tree_label":"PAUP 1","ntax":"97","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phylogenetic relationships within Silene","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_47706.phy"}]}
