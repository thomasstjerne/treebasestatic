It is based on almost 400 collections, the\ngreat majority of which were collected by three of the co-authors over a\nperiod of 40 years and were lodged in the fungarium of the Natural\nHistory Museum in Copenhagen. The material was identified using\nmolecular and morphological methods. In total, 28 species were\nrecognized, 27 belonging to three sections, H. sects Hebeloma, Denudata\nand Velutipes. One species sampled was new to science and is here\ndescribed as H. arcticum. For all species, a description, a distribution\nmap within Greenland and macro and microphotographs are presented. A key\nis provided for the 28 species. The distribution of species within\nGreenland is discussed. The findings are placed in the context of\nstudies of arctic and alpine Hebeloma from other parts of the world\nwhere comparable data exist. Notably, H. grandisporum, H. louiseae and\nH. islandicum, previously only known from Romania, Svalbard, Iceland or\nNorway, respectively, have been found in Greenland. The latter is also\nthe only species encountered that does not belong to any of the above\nsections. Hebeloma excedens and H. colvinii  for the latter we here\npublish the first modern description  are to date only known from\ncontinental North America and now Greenland.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128657","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128657.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128659","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128659.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"46","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128658","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128658.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"48","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128660","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128660.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"109","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128661","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128661.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128665","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128665.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"144","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128666","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128666.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"80","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128662","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128662.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"86","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128663","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128663.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"92","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128664","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128664.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"47","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128667","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128667.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr128668","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_128668.phy"}]}
