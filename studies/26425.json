It was sealed in glass\nbottles and preserved at an elementary school in Nagano City for 80\nyears. Only one verticillium-like fungal strain, FKI-9593 (= IFM 64743),\nhas now been isolated from the preserved material. Using a combination\nof micro-morphological characteristics and multigene sequences (SSU, LSU\nand TEF), the isolate was identified as Lecanicillium aphanocladii. A\nculture broth of the organism was used to test for antibacterial\nactivity against 13 microbes. As a result, weak antibacterial activity\nagainst Proteus vulgaris KB 127 was confirmed. Structural analysis\nidentified the active compound as oosporein.","trees":[{"tree_label":"PAUP 1+","ntax":"40","rootedtree":"FALSE","title":"Tr124075","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_124075.phy"}]}
