We\ncharacterized the mycorrhizae formed by three Lactarius species (Lac.\nsubsericatus, Lac. intermedius, Lac. salmonicolor) on silver fir, on the\nbasis of material originating from central Italy. The identification of\nthe fungal symbiont was achieved by means of morphoanatomical\nobservations of mycorrhizae, and by comparison of ITS sequences obtained\nfrom mycorrhizae and sporocarps of putative fungal partners. Sequences\nalso were obtained from specimens of the same species but from different\ngeographic origin or from closely related Lactarius species. A Maximum\nLikelihood analysis of the data was performed. On the whole, the\nresultant tree is in good agreement with sporocarp and mycorrhiza\nmorphology. RFLP patterns were calculated from sequence data. A\ndiscussion on the main morphoanatomical characters distinguishing the\nLactarius ectomycorrhizae reported in this study from those already\ndescribed belonging to related species, is also included. The levels of\nresolution provided by different methods for identifying mycorrhizae,\napplied to such closely related taxa, are discussed.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 9","ntax":"19","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Lactarius","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_3603.phy"}]}
