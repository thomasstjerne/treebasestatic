Geographical, morphological,\nbiochemical, and habitat distinctions suggest that these two chloroplast\nlineages reflect organismal lineages. Within the Pacific coastal\nchloroplast lineage, there exist sublineages that most likely reflect\ntokogenetic systems of relationship rather than organismal phylogeny, a\nhypothesis supported by the co-occurrence of more than one of these\nchloroplast sublineages in a single population. The genetic distance\nbetween any two of these chloroplast lineages ranges from 0.0001 to\n0.0024 nucleotide substitutions per site and reveals relatively high\nlevels of intraspecific divergence. We suggest that assessing\nintraspecific chloroplast DNA variation is important generally in higher\nlevel phylogenetic analysis because it enables one to obtain truer\nestimates of homoplasy, detect potentially cryptic species, and\ndistinguish among molecular markers that reflect phylogenetic\nvs.Â tokogenetic relationships. This is in addition to determining the\nextent of potential complicating factors such as introgression and\nlineage sorting from polymorphic ancestry.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"7","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Gliricidia sepium","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_676.phy"}]}
