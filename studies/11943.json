We combined genetic and ecogeographic\ndata from two closely related North American tree species, Populus\nbalsamifera and P. trichocarpa (Salicacaeae) to determine if their\ndivergence coincided with and was possibly caused by Pleistocene\nclimatic events. We analyzed 32 nuclear loci from individuals of P.\nbalsamifera and P. trichocarpa to produce coalescent-based estimates of\nthe divergence time between the two species. We coupled the coalescent\nanalyses with paleodistribution models to assess the influence of\nclimate change on speciesÂ’ range. Further, measures of niche overlap were\nused to investigate patterns of ecological differentiation between\nspecies. We estimated the divergence date of P. balsamifera and P.\ntrichocarpa at approximately 75 Ka, at the beginning of the marine\nisotope stage 4 (~ 76 Ka). Significance tests of niche overlap, in\nconjunction with genetic estimates of migration, suggested that\nspeciation occurred in allopatry, possibly resulting from the\nenvironmental effects of Pleistocene glacial cycles. Our results\nindicate the divergence of keystone tree species, that have shaped\ncommunity diversity in northern North American ecosystems, was recent\nand may have been a consequence of Pleistocene-era glaciation and\nclimate change.","trees":[{"tree_label":"588180","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"588180","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48758.phy"},{"tree_label":"751129","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"751129","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48764.phy"},{"tree_label":"676503","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"676503","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48761.phy"},{"tree_label":"652105","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"652105","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48759.phy"},{"tree_label":"STEM","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"STEM Tree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48751.phy"},{"tree_label":"781842","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"781842","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48766.phy"},{"tree_label":"816152","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"816152","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48767.phy"},{"tree_label":"678140","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"678140","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48762.phy"},{"tree_label":"769296","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"769296","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48765.phy"},{"tree_label":"657565","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"657565","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48760.phy"},{"tree_label":"560952","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"560952","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48757.phy"},{"tree_label":"195487","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"195487","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48752.phy"},{"tree_label":"424060","ntax":"60","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"424060","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48755.phy"},{"tree_label":"706088","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"706088","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48763.phy"},{"tree_label":"282601","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"282601","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48754.phy"},{"tree_label":"554813","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"554813","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48756.phy"},{"tree_label":"230239","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"230239","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48753.phy"},{"tree_label":"STEM_SearchTREE","ntax":"5","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"SearchTree","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48875.phy"},{"tree_label":"Concat_tree","ntax":"62","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Concatenated Gene Tree","tree_kind":"Gene Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_48749.phy"}]}
