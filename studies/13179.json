Pathological deformations are present in the anterior\nparietal bar and in many of the phalanges. Unfortunately, the typically\ndiagnostic posterior parietal was not recovered, hindering a definitive\nidentification of the specimen. A restricted phylogenetic analysis of\nCentrosaurinae produced an unresolved trichotomy of (TMP 2002.76.1 +\nAchelosaurus + Pachyrhinosaurus). TMP 2002.76.1 occurs near the top of\nthe DPF in a stacked channel succession that cuts out the lowest coal of\nthe 15m thick Lethbridge Coal Zone. Dates from bentonites that bracket\nthis interval suggest an age of 75.1 Ma Making TMP 2002.76.1 the first\noccurrence of a pachyrhinosaur ceratopsid in the fossil record.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 0","ntax":"11","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr55858","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_55858.phy"}]}
