One hypothesis that has received much attention\nproposes that Pleistocene climate fluctuations spurred diversification.\nHowever, while spatial patterns of distribution and phylogenetic\nrelationships can provide support for biogeographic predictions,\ntemporal estimates of divergence are required to determine the fit of\nthese geospatial patterns to climatic or biogeographic mechanisms. We\nuse multilocus DNA sequence data to test whether divergence times among\nMalagasy iguanid lizards of the subfamily Oplurinae are compatible with\na hypotheses of Quaternary diversification. We estimate the oplurine\nspecies tree and associated divergence times under a relaxed clock\nmodel. In addition, we examine the phylogeographic structure and\npopulation divergence times within two sister-species of Oplurus\nprimarily distributed in the northwest and southwest of Madagascar (O.\ncuvieri and O. cyclurus, respectively). We find that divergence events\namong oplurine lineages occurred in the Oligocene and Miocene and are\nthus far older and incompatible with the hypothesis that recent climate\nfluctuations are related to current species diversity. However, the\ntiming of intraspecific divergences and spatial patterns of population\ngenetic structure within O. cuvieri and O. cyclurus suggest a role for\nboth intrinsic barriers and recent climate fluctuations at\npopulation-level divergences. Integrating information across spatial and\ntemporal scales allows us to identify and better understand the\nmechanisms generating patterns diversity.","trees":[{"tree_label":"SubsetA PRLR","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetA, PRLR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52829.phy"},{"tree_label":"SubsetA UBN1","ntax":"66","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetA, UBN1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52831.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ocuv con","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, Ocuv, con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52835.phy"},{"tree_label":"SubsetA ND1","ntax":"32","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetA, ND1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52830.phy"},{"tree_label":"SubsetB PRLR","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetB, PRLR","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52832.phy"},{"tree_label":"SubsetB UBN1","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetB, UBN1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52833.phy"},{"tree_label":"SubsetB ND1","ntax":"24","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, SubsetB, ND1","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52834.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ocuv exp","ntax":"34","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, Ocuv, exp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52836.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ocyc con","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, Ocyc, con","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52837.phy"},{"tree_label":"Ocyc exp","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Oplurus, Ocyc, exp","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52838.phy"}]}
