In addition to three wood-decomposing\nArmillaria species (A. gallica, A. mellea subsp. nipponica and A.\ntabescens) known to infect adult plants, a novel species of Polyporales\nisolated from naturally growing protocorms was tested in a seed\ngermination assay. Xylobolus annosus, a free-living decomposer of\nRussulales, was included as a control. Seed germination occurred in a\nsawdust-based medium in sealed and unsealed containers in the presence\nof all fungi, indicating low specificity for germination. Moreover,\ngermination did not require direct seed-fungus contact. A modified\natmosphere in the air above the inoculated medium in sealed containers,\nconsisting of a lower O2 and a higher CO2 concentration, was established\nby the action of the fungi and brought about higher germination\npercentages. In nature, atmospheric conditions more effective for seed\ngermination might be established by the action of mycobionts in\ndecomposing wood. Seeds germinated in the presence of the new\nPolyporales species underwent further growth and development, as\ncompared with the other fungi tested, when covered with soil.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr58753","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_58753.phy"}]}
