Lachemilla\nrothmaleriana is characterized by its stout stems, sericeous-villous\nindumentum, and wide ascending sheaths with trilobate lateral lobes.\nLachemilla argentea presents a unique combination of tripartite basal\nleaves with an adaxial silvery villous indumentum, and decumbent\nbranches with verticillate lobed sheaths. Finally, Lachemilla cyanea has\ndistinctly basal hirsute reniform leaves with a blue-green color and\nhirsute pubescence. Phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear ribosomal\ncistron and multiple regions of the plastid genome revealed the\nallopolyploid origin of the three new taxa.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117414","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117414.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117417","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117417.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117410","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117410.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117413","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117413.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"121","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117411","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117411.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117416","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117416.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117412","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117412.phy"},{"tree_label":"con 50 majrule","ntax":"65","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr117415","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_117415.phy"}]}
