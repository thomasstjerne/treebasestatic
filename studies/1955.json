Microgramma\ncomprises ca. 30 species in the Neotropics and perhaps two species in\nAfrica and islands in the Indiean Ocean. Several species are contentious\nwith regard to generic placement, and have been treated within\nPleopeltis, Polypodiu, and Solanopteris. From all known species of\nMicrogramma, the new species differs by the sori forming irregular rows\nbetween adjacent primary veins. This finding is quite surprising,\ninasmuch as all other species in the genus have sori in two very stirct\nrows, one row on each side of the midrib. The monophyly of Microgramma,\nas newly redefined, is strongly supported in chloroplast DNA-based\npylogenetic analyses, using the gens rbcL, rps4, trps-trnS intergenic\nspacer, and trnLF intergenic spacer on 13 samples from 12 species. The\nnew species is nested within Microgramma as sister to Microgramma\nmegalophylla. Recognition of the relationships of M. microsoroides\ncalles into question certain soral characters traditionally used to\ndefine genera of Polypodiaceae as well as genera of ern sin other\nfamilies. Sorus placement is notoriously variable in some genera, in\nmany different families of Polypodiales","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"26","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Microgramma","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_5038.phy"}]}
