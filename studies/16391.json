The organization of\nmitochondrial (mt) genomes varies between the two species of booklice\ninvestigated in the genus Liposcelis. Liposcelis decolor has its mt\ngenes on a single chromosome, like most other insects; L.\nbostrychophila, however, has a multipartite mt genome with genes on two\nchromosomes.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"1","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77685","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77685.phy"},{"tree_label":"Imported tree 1","ntax":"21","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77684","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77684.phy"}]}
