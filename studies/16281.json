Recently, we collected a\nfully mature N. flexilis var. bifurcata from two lakes near the type\nlocality in Japan. The morphological characteristics of the thalli\nagreed well with that in the original description of the taxon, with\ndistinctive fertile and sterile branchlets that divided twice and\nunicellular dactyls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the fine\noospore structure of N. flexilis var. bifurcata was different from that\nof related taxa. In addition, molecular phylogenetic and haplotype\nnetwork analyses using the chloroplast rbcL DNA sequences and the\nintergenic spacer regions between atpB and rbcL genes demonstrated that\nN. flexilis var. bifurcata and N. flexilis var. flexilis were\ndistinct.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Bayesian_tree_based_on_rbcL","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77183","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77183.phy"},{"tree_label":"ML_tree_based_on_rbcL","ntax":"50","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr77184","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_77184.phy"}]}
