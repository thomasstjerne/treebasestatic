The causal organism associated with the disease is\nCercospora zeae-maydis. Two potential sibling species have been\nrecognized as Groups I and II. The DNA sequences for the internal\ntranscribed spacers (ITS1 & ITS2), the 5.8S rRNA gene, elongation\nfactor 1-a, histone H3, actin and calmodulin gene regions suggest that\nGroups I and II are two distinct species. Furthermore, Cercospora\nzeae-maydis (Group I) can be distinguished from C. zeina sp. nov. (Group\nII) by its faster growth rate on artificial media, the ability to\nproduce cercosporin, longer conidiophores, and broadly fusiform conidia.\nA PCR-based test that distinguishes the two species was developed using\nspecies-specific primers designed from the histone H3 gene.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"36","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora spp., 1 of 6 MPTs from ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2488.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"30","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cercospora spp., 1 of 2 MPTs from combined","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_2489.phy"}]}
