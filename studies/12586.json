During the disease surveys on the\nnative Mytrales trees in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, some\nfungi associated with cankers on the stems and branches of native\nMetrosideros angustifolia (Myrtaceae, Myrtales) trees were observed,\nthese fungi with the typical structures of Cryphonectriaceae. The aims\nof this study were to identify these fungi based on the DNA sequence\ncomparisons and morphological features, and to test their pathogenicity\non M. augustifolia. Based on morphology and multigene phylogenetic\nanalyses of the DNA sequence of the Action (ACT), two regions of the\nβ-tubulin (BT2/1), Calmodulin (CAL), ITS nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS),\npartial of LSU and Translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1α) gene\nregions. One new genus/species and three new species of Holocryphia\n(Cryphonectriaceae) were identified and they were named as Diversiporthe\nmetrosiderosi gen. sp. nov., Holocryphia westerncapensis sp. nov, H.\ncitrusdalensis sp. nov. and H. kleinmondensis sp. nov. The previous H.\neucalypti was revised as only the isolates from the Eucalyptus in South\nAfrica. Pathogenicity tests showed that isolates of all the new\ndescribed genus/species gave rise to lesions on the branches of M.\naugustifolia, indicated that they are all pathogenic to the M.\naugustifolia.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 3e","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia Metrosideros, 7_TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52149.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"94","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryphonectriaceae, 2_5.8 s BT21 exons","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52150.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3d","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia, 6 ITS","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52143.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3b","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia Metrosideros, 4_BT21","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52145.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"98","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Cryphonectriaceae Metrosideros, LSU","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52142.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3f","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia ACT BT21 CAL ITS TEF","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52144.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3c","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia Metrosideros, 5_CAL","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52146.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3a","ntax":"35","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Holocryphia Metrosideros, 3_ACT","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_52148.phy"}]}
