In the present\nstudy, we reported several characteristics of CR1 elements in a draft\ngenome of Arborophila rufipectus (Sichuan partridge). According to the\nanalyses of RepeatMasker, approximately 254,966 CR1 elements were\nidentified in A. rufipectus, covering 6.7% of the genome. Subsequently,\nwe selected eighteen novel CR1 elements by comparing the chicken genome,\nturkey genome and assembled A. rufipectus scaffolds. Here, a combined\ndataset comprising of twenty two CR1 loci, mitochondrial genomes and\neight unlinked introns was analyzed to infer the evolutionary\nrelationships of twelve Phasianidae species. The applicability of CR1\nsequences for inferring avian phylogeny relative to mtDNA and intron\nsequences was investigated as well. Our results elucidated the position\nof A. rufipectus in Phasianidae with robust supports that it presented a\nsister clade to Arborophila ardens/Arborophila brunneopectus, and\nimplied that genus Arborophila was in a basal phylogenetic position\nwithin Phasianidae and a phylogenetic affinity between Meleagris\ngallopavo and Pucrasia macrolopha. Therefore, this work not only\nresolved some of the confounding relationships among Phasianidae, but\nalso suggested CR1 sequences could provide powerful complementary data\nfor phylogeny reconstruction.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig S4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on seven CR1\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93578.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on twenty two CR1 element\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93565.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on twenty two CR1 element\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93567.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2a","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phasianidae based on MP analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93568.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"eight introns using *BEAST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93574.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S5b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on flanking sequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93584.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S5a","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on twenty two CR1\nelements","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93580.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 4","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based on twenty two CR1 element\nsequences","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93563.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"combined 12 mitochondrial protein coding genes using ML\nanalysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93559.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S2b","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Phasianidae based on ML analysis","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93569.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig S3a","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Species trees using *BEAST","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93570.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"12 Phasianidae species based upon eight introns","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Consensus","tree_quality":"Preferred Tree","phylotree_id":"tree_93561.phy"}]}
