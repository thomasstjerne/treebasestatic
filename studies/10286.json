As a consequence, the basionym Gilia linearifolia is here\nlectotypified and re-established for this long neglected epithet.\nNavarretia linearifolia shows strong differentiation from N. sinistra in\nallozyme data and DNA sequences from chloroplast regions, nrDNA, and\nintrons of the low copy nuclear genes idhA, idhB, and g3pdh. In\nmacroscopic features, N. linearifolia differs from N. sinistra primarily\nin tendencies, rather than absolute differences. Two finer-scale\nfeatures are diagnostic: pollen sexine sculpturing and mature seed\ncolor. The combination Navarretia linearifolia subsp. pinnatisecta is\nmade for the large flowered populations of this species geographically\nrestricted to the NW region of the California floristic province. The\nsmaller flowered N. linearifolia subsp. linearifolia extends from\nCalifornia to Washington, with a more westwardly distribution compared\nto N. sinistra, which ranges east into Idaho, Utah, and Colorado.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 ITS","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Navarretia linearifolia as Distinct vs. N.\nsinistra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6930.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 G3PDH","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Navarretia linearifolia as Distinct vs. N.\nsinistra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6866.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 idhB","ntax":"10","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Navarretia linearifolia as Distinct vs. N.\nsinistra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6922.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 cpDNA","ntax":"37","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Navarretia linearifolia as Distinct vs. N.\nsinistra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6820.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2 idhA","ntax":"18","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Navarretia linearifolia as Distinct vs. N.\nsinistra","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_6929.phy"}]}
