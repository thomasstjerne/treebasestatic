The phylogenetic position\nof the Armillaria sp. was determined using sequences of the elongation\nfactor-1α (EF-1α) gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region\n(ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of rDNA. The phylogenetic analyses based on EF-1α and\nITS sequences showed that this species differs from known Japanese\nArmillaria spp. The sequences of this species and ‘A. novae-zelandiae’\nfrom Southeast Asia were contained in a strongly supported clade, which\nwas adjacent to a well-supported sister clade containing A.\nnovae-zelandiae from Australia and New Zealand.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 1","ntax":"61","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillara sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9307.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"64","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Armillara sp.","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_9376.phy"}]}
