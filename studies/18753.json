The simultaneous use of oxygen, nitrite, and nitrate as\nelectron acceptors by Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis during the\nmicro-aerobic stage was investigated. The clade-level population\nstructure of Accumulibacter in both reactors was characterized in a\ntime-wise fashion. In the lab-scale reactor, limited-oxygen conditions\nled to an alternated dominance of Clade IID and IC over the other\nclades. Moreover, results from batch tests demonstrated that Clade IC\nwas capable of using oxygen, nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptors\nfor P uptake. A more heterogeneous distribution of clades was found in\nthe pilot-scale system, thus no specific electron acceptor utilization\ncould be attributed to any particular clade. In both reactors,\ndifferences in P uptake and nitrogen reduction rates were observed when\nnitrite and nitrate were used as electron acceptors, with increased\nrates being observed when nitrate was used for P uptake.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"652","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr93300","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_93300.phy"}]}
