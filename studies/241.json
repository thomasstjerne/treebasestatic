Portions of the\ncytoplasmic large (26S-like) and small (18S-like) subunit ribosomal RNA\ngenes were sequenced for three marchantioid liverworts (Asterella,\nConocephalum, and Riccia), three mosses (Atrichum, Fissidens, and\nPlagiomnium), and two hornworts (Phaeoceros and Notothylas). Cladistic\nanalysis of these data suggests that the hornworts are the sister group\nto the mosses, the mosses and hornworts form a clade that is sister to\nthe tracheophytes, and the liverworts form a clade sister to the other\nland plants. These results differ from previous cladistic analyses based\non morphology, ultrastructure, and biochemistry, wherein the mosses\nalone are sister group to the tracheophytes. We conclude that cladistic\nanalysis of molecular data can provide an independent data set for the\nstudy of bryophyte phylogeny, but the differences between the molecular\nand morphological results are a topic for further investigation.","trees":[{"tree_label":"Fig. 2","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"bryophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_184.phy"},{"tree_label":"Fig. 3","ntax":"13","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"bryophytes","tree_kind":"Species Tree","tree_type":"Single","tree_quality":"Unrated","phylotree_id":"tree_185.phy"}]}
