In this study, parts of two mitochondrial genes, 16S rRNA\nand 12S rRNA, were sequenced to determine the relationships between the\nsphaerodactylids that live in the Mona Passage and other Caribbean\nspecies from the same genus. While the main goal was to identify the\nbiogeographical origin of these species, we also identified a\ngenetically distinct type of dwarf gecko that warrants future evaluation\nas a possible new species. According to the reconstructed phylogenies,\nwe propose a stepwise model of colonization wherein S. nicholsi from\nsouthwestern Puerto Rico or a very close ancestor gave rise through a\nfounder event to Sphaerodactylus monensis on Mona Island. In a similar\nfashion, S. monensis or a very close ancestor on Mona Island gave rise\nto S. levinsi on Desecheo Island. This study also suggests that the most\nrecent common ancestor between the species from the islands in the Mona\nPassage and Puerto Rico existed approximately 3 MYA.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"101","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr62353","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_62353.phy"}]}
