Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses\nused either plastid or nuclear loci alone and varied greatly in their\ntaxonomic implications for the genus. We analyze additional molecular\nmarkers from the nuclear and plastid genomes, reevaluate the possibility\nof a derived loss of autonomous self-pollination, and investigate the\ntopological effects of matrix partitioning scheme choice.","trees":[{"tree_label":"tree 1","ntax":"58","rootedtree":"TRUE","title":"Tr87177","tree_kind":"NA","tree_type":"NA","tree_quality":"NA","phylotree_id":"tree_87177.phy"}]}
